URL is where the gangsta shit at I don't wanna hear all that conscious word today nigga He doesn't want me do Panther bars cause I date a Caucasian, you screamed that in my fuckin' face Well I date a white girl, you get a right curl, we both in the sunken place Nigga hold on! He says I'm always sayin' how it's one of my niggas who got the blammer You right, and an OG taught me never to admit that shit on camera Nigga hold on That's two of them thangs I was carefully drafted in the new wave Just to conjure a new classic to the page When they gave me the hope seller, felt like Coachella Only time I'm not worried about traffic in L.A You think you've mastered what to say? So the conscious is thankin' him You don't support black banks and them, so they won't put me on the rank with him But that means he's a customer, I'm a hustler Y'all gon' have to walk plank wit him For trustin' a nigga that sees Hamilton more than one that sees Franklins And that's why, and he's bankin' on the fact that it's his knowledge I fear You talkin' selfies with books lodged to your ear Is B. Dot's first novel idea Boy I mix what you call illegal but still mournin' for my people I ran this check up on KG just to send the money to Puerto Rico But I'm a man over a thug, right? But tonight, it's Black African power Well, tonight, it's another plan I put a horse head in his bed spread the same shape as the motherland Nigga hold on And I'm a man over a thug Raised by the scammers and the drugs You ever tripped over your cell phone charger? My niggas really ran up on the plug Boy forget about the bud, get your mind up out the club I avoided pig but every meal I had to get up out the mud And you ain't about the hub Cause New York got you stressin' I got a W on that New York stage throwin' W's, nigga reppin' I beat a Brooklyn nigga in Brooklyn, see that dawg ain't up in you Cause I flew 6,000 miles to beat a nigga that could walk to the venue And I stay that way While you stay at bay You can't take flight on Kennedy bein' scared to land at JFK Nigga hold on See you can't master what is right, until you step out of class to set the fight All those books you read can't get you past this chapter in your life See New York tells me they doubtin' you When I'm there I tell them I'm proud of you Cause on the east I hold him down, on the west I hold you accountable Nigga hold on That's cause I'm loyal to my soil, even when preparin' for battle Do you believe in Adam and Eve? Nigga, then why you so scared of The Apple? And you had to! And B. Dot had to to skip the Proving Ground He was lettin' the fame hurt you Don't you know cuttin' corners put you in that same circle? What a shame? Hurtful Come to grips with the truth You'd rather sit on the roof than fight and sit with the troops You never put mileage on your car, just to put chips on your tooth You ain't Superman, you Wonder Woman, nigga ya whip tells the truth Hold on Boy, stop with the pride and only sendin' shots from this side Goin' to the east makes you a beast Only thing you provin' is that you not gonna ride I proved I won't fold on the road and this is not the 405 B. Dot the only fast track means you gotta have a little box in your drove You know what I'm sayin' That was crazy, I'm unbreakable, unfadeable Your fate? Is replaceable I'm erasin' the fate of father to show my mom that I'm capable You chasin' a fade with Saga just to have a debatable You chase the fade with Saga to show him who he's been prayin' to I'm a god vs a facade who won't put the ratchets down Y'all cheer him talkin' 'bout blastin' rounds I'm only empowerin' caps and gowns See we had masters then I got my masters, I turned that back around We was brought here on slave ships...look at me, I'm the captain now They gon' capture your rounds and turn it into a clip that goes viral B. Dot in ten years they gon' capture my rounds and turn it into a bible! This ain't even a rival They say the teachers incredible because of the reach on the pedestal and how he speak to the head of you I never been a teacher's pet, you see you leeches is terrible Go ahead and bring him an apple I'm just gon' leave him a vegestable And that's how I achieve, what I achieve is incredible Where they find me at? ....Is that time? No, this is the West, nigga, gimme my time to rap! Hold on I was homeless in a hooptie: rusty Pontiac All hunger with no slumber, you know how your conscious act When you skip sleepin' for a weekend, you just stuck in the car and rap What I'm sayin' is: Don't talk that woke shit to a fuckin' insomniac Nigga the bomb is back! You know what though? EK, this ain't even about competition Look my nigga you charged with bein' a slave to the URL system Think of this as a film inquisition I'm 'bout to give you a chance to make sure you don't dance around these topics during your deposition True or false: you flew to the east on your own cost Battled Jerry Wess then lost Was supposed to be the future, with the Mask on Smokin' But ended up bein' regular Jim Carrey with it off Then you never got the call That couldn't happen to me I'm very much a boss They didn't want me to battle Cor' They said, ""Well make him give you the other half back"" Lyin', that's a battle they couldn't block Then they tried to change the pitch but I already scored six, shit I'm Barry with the toss Against Cali, you went off, but you still wasn't on I mean you battled YK in The Bay they say you tried to stay a bit too long I mean they told you when to go, stupid Ya dumb? They wasn't playin' you a song This ain't just about you there's a few involved West coast niggas, what they do to y'all? This ain't food for thought I mean it's stickin' to the plate just so they can say, ""Aye! Y'all sleep on it we'll get it off at the break of dawn."" That's when your brain gets washed What's what we came here for? Now you niggas switchin' ya ways while I'm still N.W.A I'm sure y'all remember them days Imagine if Eazy, Dre or Ren would've say ""This L.A. shit ain't gettin' us paid. We need to switch up and change."" Nah, instead they paved the way, created lanes for all the shit that we say Ain't nothin' different today We could've done the same thing with battle rap Instead y'all folded, let out-of-towners come in and promote it Now, we don't even got a hand in that We could've won L.A By ourselves we could've got this done L.A But y'all kept sayin' we needed AIDS so they sent the nigga from Michigan to come run LA This could've been Magic Instead it's URL: Traffic Tragic But hold on to this, grasp it This the closest y'all gon' get to a west coast Summer Madness Then I'm passed this I'm just up here statin' the facts This is the cheapest I've ever been paid for a match But I thank you for that I ain't like I'm some king on the throne I just guess King Of The Dot treated me the same way y'all treated Charron You know a white boy with confederate flags wavin' a Mag is what you condone But got me up here in front of this Utah nigga talkin' all this Jazz While my stock ten times better than his and he's assisting Malone? ""Well, you know, Charron, he skipped the PG's cause he built his prestige as a rapper."" ""Yeah on King Of The Dot, I thought this was the only league that matters."" ""Oh you know with Charron he got millions of views when we tallied up the amount."" ""Yeah on King Of The Dot. I thought this was the only league that counts."" What is this really about? Is this some ego thing cause y'all dealin' with a nigga wit' clout? Cause I led the league with the greatest perception without a pass from y'all cause I stuck to my routes? Oh I figured you out I'm supposed to be happy to be on this stage, of course you Smack Look, I support black business but black business gotta support you back Back in the PG's just happy to be promoted Y'all notice he retired from battle rap, got rehired by Smack but then demoted You bogus You up here sleep walkin', losin' focus I'm swingin' on you, left and right, you gettin' clocked out of hypnosis But let's focus On these money hungry league owners Beasley had a problem with Diz' sayin' ""nigga""...well that's what he told us But let's expose this cause I was like ""Oh that's wild"" I guess as long as you gettin' Money Bagz you'll allow a white boy to say ""nigga"" on your stage in front of an all black crowd Shit is foul And y'all don't see the manipulation I mean your fans don't ever say shit Look, I rock with Roc but even look how they plan Tay shit They got him locked up caged in Can't go to the other leagues and get the cheese, that don't make sense I mean, is he being rewarded Or is this the same trick that got us boarded on the slave ship from that European invasion Capitalism, they ain't change it The old master say, ""You niggas ain't goin' nowhere"" New masters say, ""It only matters on this plantation."" This is basic and y'all don't even think to condemn it Yeah they tell you you a free slave until they hit you with that Thirteenth Ammendment Then your ass stuck in prison lookin' for a deacon or a pastor Look, I don't know what's worse, workin' for the white man or workin' for your black brother that think he your master I'm just closin' this chapter Ain't no turnin' back for me I did this for Loso, Jimz and all of them that don't have to do this after me I mean, don't lose your integrity lettin' these niggas lock you down Claimin' the PG is the master key I'm from the west, I'm only here to see Dizaster tweek Ayo Roc, I hope they paid you a lot my nigga cause LA gas ain't cheap This is the west! We started gangsta rap, I'm gon' need our thanks for that Yeah I know the east started rap, cool, we not claimin' that But if URL is about gang bangin' slangin' crack and bangin' straps Well then bitch, LA is where it should be stationed at! If you had that big of a problem with Smack.... Why didn't you start your black business and hit us with that grown talk? He's gon' say, ""I was busy. I was...it's Charron fault."" Hold on nigga, hold on B. Dot we got shit to work through and the aim is never to hurt you But can we reverse to, your verse two angle, on that Verb tangle When you said some shit I took a little personal How you said Aye Verb's daddy struck his mama and that's what changed his identity Cause he was then raised by that single mama and that's why the change in femininity But what about the change in yo' energy? I mean, when did your tales of talkin' get derailed so often? When did domestic abuse become B. Dot's next best excuse to call a nigga frail and mock him? When did callin' Verb ""gay"" for two rounds just cause a female had taught him Outweigh the significance of a female raisin' a nigga that's not in jail or a coffin Cause I was single mother raised and I got memories of pops hittin' on her But when you downplay single mother's success that's you just shittin' on her See you said Verb got head rolls and finger snaps Facts. He did But that to me was kind of scary Cause that black woman stereotype is only used by Fox News and Tyler Perry And that's why I'm kinda leery, and dissecting what you did You preferred Verb's mom parasailing, niggas shiftin' through the crib So when Verb's a little kid, he's got father figures now But they just fuck moms and tuck arms so Verb won't put the trigger down And now he's grabbin' weapons in adolescence and if that don't put him in the ground The fate he earns, the trait he learned from them and that's to never stick around And then that cycle starts over, and that night you became that promoter When you went at Verb's weight and dismissed the weight that's on his mother's shoulders See I don't even know if he like knew you But that made me wonder if B. Dot truthful Cause sayin' a female would raise a trans-parent made me see right through you Nigga hold on See I'm not just teachin' lessons But you sayin' females suggest the affection of a boy It's not toys, the biggest gift you give as a parent is just bein' present And that's all that should matter But your antiquated thoughts confuse the data Cause you only have the perspective of a male and no mom but that's what causes the cancer And you supposed to have the thoughts of a Panther, but your words hold us back See masculinity ain't man's destiny to shoot fades or hold a strap It's just being comfortable with who you are, but you drifted far from knowin' that See men treat all with respect but check niggas who don't show it back Don't think I ain't notice that All that hate you was tellin' him I think it's significant B. Dot, can't embrace what is feminine So if you have a prescription to his diction just cause he speaks about race and the melanin Just remember, never trust a doctor who don't like the taste of his own medicine And that's why I'm ahead of him Cause I know the of a father I prefer Terrance have two parents, but I know that raisin' is harder I took care of my sis' hurtin' when moms was workin' and couldn't embrace one of her daughters So bein' raised by a woman didn't make me woman, nigga it made me a father! So hold on It made me a father, I had to embrace what was harder But you speakin' on punk shit, your female fans should jump ship For takin' that angle on young kids Versus Danny you told women who to date and who not to fuck wit I'm just tellin' those women who looks down on him and who really up lifts Diesel brings his daughter to my crib And we let her just draw, right? We don't talk gang shit, we watch our language cause he knows that's how she's best off So similar to when these niggas hop in each other's battles Say one line to prevent loss .... If something happens to Diesel I pick up right where you left off Nigga and that's facts And that's why you just lost Cause you tryin' to walk that fine line of black activist/Einstein And using gay angles from Grind Time When Lux said ""yo' pops ain't no gangsta"", that one stayed on my mind Cause he said ""He's just another lost nigga"" and I spent years tryin' to find mine But hold on, that's just the luck of the stuck And being in a rut as a mutt Maybe you're right, I didn't have a father to toughen me up Cause I get emotional when you insinuate that my mother's a crutch Cause my mother raised a nigga that's currently fuckin' you up! Nigga that's right And I know that this battle shit confuses you But I'm a fan of B. Dot cause I feel battle rap is in a jam I was hopin' he'd 3-0 me I know to be the GOAT sometime you gotta be the sacrificial lamb Nigga hold on ",rap,E,https://genius.com/Urltv-b-dot-vs-emerson-kennedy-lyrics,2017.0

T-Pain),Flo Rida,376636,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

Do you understand how many Will Smith/Chris Rock punchlines I had to scrap for you?! And organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate It smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday We’re having this clash judged too, by performers he would have to know Because they rap for, YOUR platform – this sports arena that you own I can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go This is about as unbiased as Kim Jong Un in a North Korean Talent show I’ve also seen your battles though – I’ve got you figured out: 'Roids Simmer down, mate, you should be chilling out, poised Think about it all he has is a loud voice But your writing’s more of a shits how than Mrs. Brown’s Boys You hit mid-thirties and went up about six dress sizes You are a limping, groaning, knuckle-dragging midlife crisis I don’t care who’s most popular, I care about who’s the nicest You have a bigger name than me?

Drop the act This rotten apple’s, gotten bad, he’s lost and tangled, shocking tact, you’re not a man you’re a youth That’s not what adults should do Acting like everyone’s against him, what an arrogant view Like you’re the center of attention?

I've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers You rhyme words together really well That's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle That's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle That's where you seem to struggle You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle YOU let him do this with no conviction Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle That's why we don't believe in ya So many elite MC's that leagues above ya We don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle You get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part I told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code Like it's an invincible spell He thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L All that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be If you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself Second round in, safe star bless Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left {Shuffle pulls out his phone} ""Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR?

Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help."" Listen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying When he does smile, his Face ID doesn’t recognize him That, and you've put on a amount of weight A bit of padding around the face You're the man of the house, it's great I bet your calorie count's insane But I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised I don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape Now, he DID beat me in that film VS – but it was hard for me to lose that Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, “We can’t really use that It needs to be WORSE than Shotty’s material, so can you write us a new rap?” I said, “WORSE than Shotty’s stuff…? I don’t know if I can do that.” In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts To make my stuff as bad as what’s coming out that fucking mouth of his At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit The director said, “I think we’ll need to dumb it down a bit.” I was in 8 Mile as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck Producer called me personally said, “We need you for this, Shuff” I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut Apparently, me getting beat wasn’t “believable enough” Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry But it’s an understatement if you're describing me as ‘hungry’ That’s like calling Ian Huntley a ‘cheeky monkey’ I feel so comfy up here, I’m winning this in every round I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you The second that a battle’s not inside of the M62 I could’ve had this battle in your house in your parent’s living room And have them both arguing over who they’d give it to Your mom gives it to me So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate’s rates I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay I don’t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today Don’t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win’s clear on stage I just don’t care about the teams, cause I’m not 6 years of age Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million I am my own worst critic and I think I’m fucking brilliant! So fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle Let’s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word ‘shuffle’ Time I mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck I've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them But there's this Joe Pesci notion... Funny how? If you focusin' Cause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em Cause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin' But you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him Cause I don't fuck my friends over You get bad luck from it Pussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure He's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together He does not give a fuck I've never met anybody as bold as he is Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the Sound Like show that evenin'? And he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings He sat there like, ""What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating Boys I have Ronan Keating."" He does not give a fuck, you have to understand That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys Without them, I don't think the scene you see today exists I'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down I'm just sayin', you ain't legit Cause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this Loyal to the soil I don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz You don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit That's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this Cause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it And I'm the guy that pays you it And I did your little panel show for free twice It was COVID times I let the love persuade me You couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy You came at me with the whole ""we're friends"" angle and I Cause me charging Shuffle shady Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was ""fuck you pay me"" So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class These posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps And wanna turn it into data and a ""Click this link and learn how to be hip hop"" FUCK OFF! We ain't got the patience for all a dat For your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed I didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book I was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps People hated, FUCK THAT I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank Me versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match Cause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious It's not a joke Cause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks It's one of those Why do your arms look so heavy bro? I gotta know You look like every single trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home Fuckin' strange guy Lookin' like the little Men In Black alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time And thank you very much Another straight, white, male with a podcast With long hair and edgy jokes It's fuckin' Russel off-Brand That's me, thank you Now your music has actually been a little different lately When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady That Scum Of The Earth album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy I said, “Do you think you might have ripped them off a bit?” He said “mayyyyyybeeeeeeee!"" I said, “Yeah, Definitely Maybe Here’s what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little' Then you just 'Roll With It' Head up in the clouds I mean he doesn’t hear it It makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about No one’s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound In fact, I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now 'Don't Look Back In Anger' You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, it’s not You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully But musically, now you’re nowhere near as good as it used to be Cause when you sell out your art for a dime It’ll never be far from your mind Cause when you’ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb You’re energy starved and you’ll try, but never regrasp on those heights Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines And everything’s harder to rhyme Integrity’s hard to define But when you pretend to be part of a life Of the celebrity’s art that you like All you’re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime So, all you’ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise That’s why you’re running out of smoke like a contestant on Stars In Their Eyes Tonight Matthew, I’m going to shove Noel’s Gallagher’s dick in every hole that it can fit The only role that you can give, this ain’t a cold slap on the wrist You’re facing the whole character list of Soul Caliber 6 That’s why he’s saying shit lines these days like ""It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets"", oh my God, you're such a prick The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn’t fuck with it I was just watching with a confused face, I couldn’t keep up with it Not because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit ""Italian blood running the streets"" – I’ll slow down I’m out maneuvering I'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym I don’t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him Let me say something simple and make it official Battle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme You make it sound complex but it’s always just the same obnoxious theme People used to be able to battle in a way they’d want to speak Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean? Every line it’s “I said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?” I’m just watching from the side like “Mate. It isn’t that clever.” So, I won’t dress this up with word play I’ll just tell you what the truth is I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit Your battles aren’t that great these days, neither is your music I think you’re overrated, and I think you’re fuckin' stupid This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent You make something simple feel like rocket science I make rocket science feel like comic timing Like Hugh Laurie, The Two Ronnies or Monty Python It doesn’t make an ounce of difference how you spin it Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness This counterfeited coward’s limits There’s always praise for you and you’re showered with it Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit They put you in the top 4 they’ve mapped out your image Well, you can have Mount Rushmore I’ll take Mount Olympus You say I’m a clown as if it means that I’m annoyed I love that reputation, that's my pride and joy So, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy! Take that belt to its biting point I’ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you’ll have a higher voice than a choirboy’s! If you’re watching from overseas – watch more UK battle rap Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It’s action packed Watch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat! See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle’s what I make it You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips You’re an imitator – you see what’s out there and you claim it I’m an innovator – I see what’s out there and I change it Time ",rap,E,https://genius.com/Premier-battles-shotty-horroh-vs-shuffle-t-lyrics,2023.0

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.
