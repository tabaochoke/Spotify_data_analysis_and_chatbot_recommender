"<h1>What Are The Best Selling Songs of All Time?</h1><p>There is no single source that can claim to have theÂ <a href=""https://soulmatetwinflame.com/index.php/2022/07/18/best-selling-songs-of-all-time/"" data-real-link=""true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">best selling songs</a> of all time. Estimates of global sales have been compiled from a variety of sources. However, some sales figures may be inflated by record companies. Nevertheless, there are some songs that have made the list over the years, and some have been ranked as the best selling.</p>

<h2>Celine Dion's love theme for Titanic</h2><p>""My Heart Will Go On"" is a powerful, emotional ballad that was written for the film Titanic. The song is sung by Celine Dion, who was the most popular singer of her day. While she had been initially reluctant to record the song, she soon changed her mind after hearing a demo. It has since become one of the most successful songs of all time.<br>
Celine Dion originally didn't want to record another movie theme, and she initially mouthed ""I don't want to do that song!"" to her manager. However, her manager pressed her to record the song, and she agreed.<br>
The success of the song is largely due to Celine Dion's incredible voice. It captures the themes of the film and communicates the depth of Rose's love for Jack. The song has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and has become one of the most popular songs of all time.<br>
Despite the fact that it was written for a movie, the song has actually sold more than two million copies in the US alone. It was also the winner of the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. The song is also the second-most streamed song in the US.</p>

<h2>Celine Dion's Silent Night</h2><p>The song was initially a minor hit, but it became one of the biggest selling songs of all time. It became the official theme song of the film Titanic. The original recording was done in just one take. However, a remix in 1991 made the song even more popular.<br>
Despite its traditional roots, ""Silent Night"" has evolved from its humble beginnings in a small village in Austria 200 years ago. Since then, it has been performed on countless recordings and was instrumental in bringing nations together during World War I. It's even been designated a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.<br>
Celine Dion's version is very different. She offers a warm, calming voice. The song is likely to be heard throughout the holidays, and its lyrics are ideal for sharing with loved ones. Her vocals are also rich and smooth, making it a great choice for a Christmas playlist.<br>
""Silent Night"" is also one of the best-known songs from the musical genre. The original was composed by Franz Xaver Gruber in 1818. He wrote the lyrics for Joseph Mohr, and it has been recorded by a variety of singers. The Bing Crosby version of the song was the fourth best-selling single of all time.<br>
""My Way"" by Elvis Presley is another classic. This song was recorded by the crooner on May 29, 1942. It has sold more than fifty million copies worldwide. This song was so popular that it has been listed in the Guinness Book of Records.</p>

<h2>Pharrell Williams' Happy</h2><p>Pharrell Williams has made a name for himself as one of the most influential and successful songwriters of our generation. The singer-producer has been involved in various projects, including co-producing the smash hit albums by Justin Timberlake and Daft Punk. He has also had a hand in designing clothing, and he has a knack for marketing.<br>
""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams is a bouncy, feel-good tune that has become a hit for both the artist and the music industry. Its title may not make it sound like an uplifting song, but it has quickly become a genre classic and has topped the charts. A stunning video accompanying the song, ""24 Hours of Happy,"" showcases the joy that the track evokes.<br>
""Happy"" was written by Pharrell Williams for the Despicable Me movie soundtrack. The production team declined to use any of his previous songs, so Happy is a unique piece of work. It was later reissued on December 16, 2013 as a standalone song and was the lead single from his album Girl. It became Williams' first #1 Billboard Hot 100 single as a lead artist and was certified a diamond by the RIA.<br>
The song ""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams has become a global hit, reaching the top spot on Billboard's Hot 100 and topping charts in over 75 countries around the world. Now Pharrell Williams has translated the hit song into a picture book for the youngest readers. Featuring a range of child photographs from all over the world, this book is full of memorable childhood moments.</p>

<h2>Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You</h2><p>Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" is one of the best-selling songs of all time. Houston's version of the song was released in 1992 for the film The Bodyguard, where it spent 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It still holds the record for being the best-selling single by a woman in the history of recorded music. Since Whitney Houston's death in 2012, her version has been covered by many artists.<br>
The song was originally a country ballad written by Dolly Parton. The resulting recording was lavishly produced, and it quickly became one of Houston's most popular songs, selling millions of copies. The recording also had an incredibly broad appeal, becoming a staple dance song throughout the world.<br>
After its release in 1990, Houston recorded another version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. It had previously been featured in the 1991 movie Fried Green Tomatoes. The film's director, Mick Jackson, approached Clive Davis to get a recording of the song for the movie. The song had been recorded by other artists, including Linda Ronstadt.<br>
""Hollywood"" debuted at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It went on to become Whitney Houston's tenth number one single. The song won many awards, including the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It also won the 1992 Soul Train Music Award and the R&amp;B Song of the Year. It is the longest-running number-one single from a movie soundtrack.</p>

<h2>Ed Sheeran's Shape of You</h2><p>Ed Sheeran's ""Shape of You"" is spending its seventh week atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song has nearly double the number of chart points of its nearest competitor. Compared to ""I Will Always Love You,"" the song sold more than 41.5 million copies.<br>
The song ""Shape of You"" is one of the most popular songs of all time. It is Ed Sheeran's second best-selling single, and has sold over 42 million copies worldwide. It has also set a new record for the number of digital copies sold. It was released in January 2017, and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance.<br>
The song has received a lot of criticism for copyright infringement. The song was accused of stealing a part of a song by Sami Chokri. However, Sheeran has denied stealing the song. However, Sami Chokri, the singer of the song ""Shape of You,"" claimed that the song was similar to his own. The two singers settled in April 2017.<br>
Ed Sheeran's Shape of You was released on 1 January 2017. It has a global reach. It became the fastest selling male artist in the UK. The album spawned five hit singles. One of them, ""Shape of You,"" was declared the ninth best-selling song of all time by Billboard. Another hit, ""Castle on the Hill"", debuted at number six in the US and reached number four in the UK.</p>

<h2>Elton John's Candle in the Wind</h2><p>""Candle in the Wind"" was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin and became one of the most popular songs in the world. The song, which was a tribute to the late Princess Diana, is one of the most successful songs of all time. It's also one of the best-selling singles of all time, so it's important to note that it wasn't actually written for the Princess. The song's authors, John and Taupin, were inspired to write the song after reading the obituary of Janis Joplin.<br>
Elton John's career spans over five decades, and his greatest hits include ""Candle in the Wind"" and ""Candle in the Wind."" His popularity grew rapidly, with albums and singles selling more than 300 million copies worldwide. The singer also hosts his own music channel, Apple Music Show, where he hosts thoughtful conversations with rising and established artists and shares music from his extensive record collection.<br>
The Elton John version of ""Candle in the Wind"" was recorded in December 1986 at Sydney Entertainment Centre, Australia. The song was performed without a band and featured a keyboard effect that Elton controlled. The song was released in June 1987 as the second single from Elton John's album Live in Australia With the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The song was also included on the album ""Candle in the Wind"" (released in 1997).<br>
While the song had been one of Elton John's greatest hits, it wasn't always easy to get a hold of it. The song was recorded in Sydney, Australia, and stripped down to piano and synthesizers. Despite the fact that it was sung during the height of the AIDS epidemic, the song was still very popular and hit the top of the charts in the United States. One of the lyrics, ""Goodbye England's Rose,"" summed up the sadness and angst of that time.</p>

Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen<br>
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?</i><br>

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br>
Had a very shiny nose<br>
And if you ever saw it<br>
You would even say it glows<br>
All of the other reindeer<br>
Used to laugh and call him names<br>
They never let poor Rudolph<br>
Join in any reindeer games<br>

Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br>
Santa came to say<br>
""Rudolph with your nose so bright<br>
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""<br>
Then how the reindeer loved him<br>
As they shouted out with glee<br>

[Verse 1]<br>
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br>
Had a very shiny nose<br>
And if you ever saw it<br>
You would even say it glows<br>
All of the other reindeer<br>
Used to laugh and call him names<br>
They never let poor Rudy<br>
Join in any reindeer games<br>
<br>

Then, one foggy Christmas Eve<br>
Santa came to say<br>
""Rudolph with your nose so bright<br>
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Then, how the reindeer loved him<br>
As they shouted out with glee<br>
""Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br>
You'll go down in history""<br>

I think about youâonâthe road whenâI tear down the booth<br>
Girl, Iâcan't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shitâoutâofâyou<br>
Even on yourâworst days, girl,âyou still kind of cute<br>
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot<br>
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you<br>
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do<br>

Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually<br>
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy<br>
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me<br>

It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it<br>

And haulin' through the snow at a frightenin' speed<br>
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead<br>

"<p>To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, weâre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever<br>
<br>
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture<br>
<br>
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like <a href=""/3906523/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs/Ice-t-and-nwa-were-not-only-ruling-rap-but-beginning-to-enter-the-mainstream-music-conversation"" data-id=""3906523"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation</a><br>
<br>
While rap has evolved, thereâs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboardâs Hot Rap Songs chart, weâre counting down the top 100 songs in the tallyâs quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""Drake - Gently ft. Bad Bunny (TraducciÃ³n al EspaÃ±ol)""]<br>
<br>
[Intro: Drake]<br>
SÃ­<br>
Mi G, TitÃ­ vino VIP con un rebaÃ±o<br>
Nena, mi muÃ±eca es de Casablanco<br>
Me gusta su sonrisa aunque me haga daÃ±o<br>
Yo vivo como los Sopranos, Italianos<br>
He sido ""El Chico"" por 50 aÃ±os<br>
Me gusta su culazo perreando<br>
Le da hasta abajo, le gusta este tamaÃ±o<br>
Dale, Papi ChampaÃ±o, jheez<br>
Ah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh<br>
<br>
[Verso 1: Drake]<br>
O es reducir la velocidad al viaje o acelerar la visa<br>
Yo no quiero dejarte<br>
Agarro Eliza, a ella la traigo a Ibiza<br>
Te presento a Richie Akiva<br>
Mi hermanito Benito, Ã©l necesita a una bonita<br>
Una loca-ah, bien loquita<br>
Gracie Bon, mi amor, mi amiga<br>
Ella sabe que estÃ¡ bien rica<br>
<br>
[Puente: Bad Bunny]<br>
Â¿Usted se cree que yo quiero que me invierta mi dinero en la 42 donde la gente estÃ¡ bailando dembow?<br>
Ey, ja, ey, ey, ey<br>
Ay, santo, Dios mÃ­o, quÃ© acicale<br>
En RD estÃ¡n to's mis cueros, en PR to'a las gyales<br>
Las mÃ­as se roban el show si sale<br>
To's quieren ser yo, pero no les sale<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]<br>
En Casa de Campo, chucky, en MÃ©xico ando bÃ©lico<br>
Baby, vo'a joderte el cosmÃ©tico<br>
TrÃ©pate encima, ponme la skimask<br>
Bajen la luz y cierren la cortina<br>
Que no quiero video, estoy harto de la foto<br>
Estoy harto de to'l mundo, meno' de ese toto, de ese toto, je<br>
Meno' de ese toto, de ese toto, je, ey<br>
Botella de champaÃ±a yo las descorchÃ©<br>
Me puse bellaco cuando la escuchÃ©<br>
Decirme ""papi"" adentro 'e la Porsche<br>
Mierda, mami, santa mierda<br>
QuÃ© rico tÃº chinga', je<br>
Las boris me piden bicho, las cubana' quieren pinga<br>
""Follame tan bien,"" me dice la gringa<br>
Mami, te pasaste, ey<br>
<br>
[Outro: Bad Bunny]<br>
La baby tiene marido y no me dijo na', je<br>
Tranquila, eso no e' na'<br>
Doscienta' botella y por ahÃ­ vienen mÃ¡'<br>
Por ahÃ­ vienen mÃ¡'<br>
La baby tiene marido y no me dijo na', je<br>

"<p>Who's debonair with the tall silk hat<br>
Muffler of wool and a tummy that's fat?<br>
King for the day and he loves the road<br>
With a broomstick cane and a heart of gold<br>

That's Frosty the Snowman<br>
He's a jolly happy soul<br>
With a corncob pipe and a button nose<br>
And two eyes made out of coal<br>
Frosty the snowman<br>
Is a fairytale they say<br>
He was made of snow<br>
But the children know<br>
How he came to life one day<br>
<br>
There must have been some magic<br>
In that old silk hat they found<br>
For when they placed it on his head<br>
He began to dance around<br>
<br>
Oh, Frosty the snowman<br>
Was alive as he could be<br>
And the children say<br>
He could laugh and play<br>
Just the same as you and me<br>
<br>
<i>Oh, Frosty the snowman<br>
Knew the sun was hot that day</i><br>
So he said, ""Let's run<br>
And we'll have some fun<br>
Now before I melt away""<br>
<i>So, down to the village<br>
With a broomstick in his hand</i><br>
Running here and there all around the square<br>
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""<br>
<br>
He led them down the streets of town<br>
Right to the traffic cop<br>
And he only paused a moment when<br>
He heard him holler ""Stop!""<br>
<br>
For Frosty the snowman<br>
Had to hurry on his way<br>
But he waved goodbye<br>
Saying, ""Don't you cry<br>
I'll be back again some day""<br>

<i>Hey, listen</i><br>

[Verso 2: El Padrinito Toys &amp; <i>Oscar Maydon</i>]<br>
Me puse los collares<br>
Ay, quÃ© santa protecciÃ³n<br>
El padrino Leo ya me consultÃ³<br>
Me dijo: Mijo, tÃº cÃ³mete al mundo<br>
Que la vida se va en un segundo<br>

Some said I wasn't gonna-<br>

But I show up to the showdown<br>
To show off when the show's on for all of the crowd!)<br>

Haha...fuckin' he<br>
""I like to talk about multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""<br>
You fuckin' geek<br>
Stay up for a couple weeks?<br>
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep<br>
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth<br>

""Oh I wrote the book on multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""<br>
You fuckin' geek<br>
You stay up for a couple weeks?<br>
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep<br>
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth<br>
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat<br>
Cause of this humongous heap of things that rhyme with ""wannabe""<br>
Tellin' Rowan you're not goin' to battle in some fuckin' club in Leeds<br>
On Don't Flop ""Hustlin' It Free"" cause you got an upcoming book release<br>
And I congratulated him like, ""You wrote a book? What an amazing guy.""<br>
When you hear he wrote a book your thoughts go to some of our greatest minds<br>
I said, ""What's your book about? Space and time?<br>
Ancient tribes?<br>
The economic crisis as we sit back and watch inflation rise<br>
No, no, no, it's a novel, something more on the creative vibe<br>
No, conspiracy theories<br>
Children of <i>The Matrix</i> vibe<br>
David Icke<br>
Please, tell me the subject you're takin' with this publication, cause I cannot take the hype<br>
He looked me dead in the face, and right<br>
He said, ""I wrote a book about complicated rhymes.""<br>
""Complicated rhymes?!""<br>
""Yeah. Multisyllabics<br>
They absolutely have to be done when you rap to the punch of it like<br>
Plus the grammatical structure and pattern needs a straight function and fashion<br>
But I'll allow for slight discrepancies depending on the native tongue of the accent but that does come with an asterisks<br>
And...you know...you know...who needs to kiss a girl?<br>
That's stuff just a distraction, I don't need direct sunlight or a shower. None of it<br>
Why would I go to a club and get plastered<br>
When I can stay at home, figure out the number of attractors<br>
And sift through my rejection emails to see if the publishers haven't told me I need to- told me I need to be fuckin' embarrassed?""<br>
I'm joking<br>
He's kissed a girl before<br>
Have you kissed a girl before?<br>
He's kissed a girl before<br>
In fact, Shuffle and his ex just finalized a fuckin' divorce<br>
Bitch wrote the man a rhyme for Valentines and he told her her multi's were forced<br>
The man even pointed a score<br>
Give her just under a four<br>
She laughed it off<br>
""Oh my Adam it's funny for sure.""<br>
But he said she should've known better she did something he just couldn't ignore<br>
Especially now he's booked in the store so he doesn't love her no more<br>
Fuckin' run for the door<br>
Fuckin' guy<br>
Awkward as fuck, walkin' like he's got a wooden spine<br>
Doesn't let you sing ""Happy Birthday"" to him because it doesn't rhyme<br>
Wore his weird fuckin' trench coat a 100 times<br>
Got you lookin' like you come disguised<br>
As a cunt that likes the under 5's<br>
Nonce!<br>
Wore it so many times he doesn't need to hang up his coat<br>
He hasn't washed it in years<br>
He takes it off and it stands on it's own<br>
That coat is alive<br>
It's symbiosis<br>
It demands the controls when attached to a host<br>
I saw him put his hand inside said jacket, and it actually moaned<br>
""Oooh yeah.""<br>
""Oooh ye-""<br>
Either it's been the same jacket for 10 years or you got ten on a rack on a special stack like <i>Dexter's Lab</i><br>
Each of 'em have a tiny pocket which contains a microscopic list of all the sex you've had<br>
That coat screams, ""Why does she never text me back?""<br>
So dirty every time he wears it his neck gets chapped and his flesh is cracked with a reddish rash<br>
I gave him a hook last week and my leg was scratched<br>
I had to get a [?]<br>
Fuck that coat!<br>
I've never known anything to smell as bad, it gets me mad<br>
When I see it, it makes me wanna Jet like a Pepsi ad for collecting cans<br>
That one's for the Netflix fans, you get me gang?<br>
Baow!<br>
That's my first round in, safe star blessed<br>
I've got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left!<br>
<br>
[Round 1: Shuffle T]<br>
Everybodyâs been, telling me I wonât ever survive my next foe<br>
I was never alive, been sentenced to life, they sent me to fry at death row<br>
Theyâve already supplied some fresh clothes, the burial site, the headstone<br>
Iâm dead on arrival, end of the line, but ready to die, so letâs go!<br>
Thatâs why Iâve drafted a willâ¦<br>
Now I'd like <i>Sounds Like</i> to continue so I leave the registered rights to Pedro<br>
And I want Big J to finally get that sexy, designer trench coat<br>
And to Soul I leave my engraved piece of Jefferson Priceâs bedpost<br>
And a really, really, really long collection of rhymes for <i>Death Note</i><br>
Because Iâm battling Shotty Horroh â yeah?<br>
The genius<br>
I mean it<br>
In Manchester, this guy is Jesus<br>
I am in utter shock, I'm giddy â in pieces<br>
Underprepared best man...Iâm speechless<br>
They said, ""Shottyâs back to battling, itâs just like the olden days.""<br>
Couldnât believe it âGodâs back, huh? Holy shoulder bladesâ<br>
Well fuck it Iâm back, too<br>
Whatâs up Premier Battles? You already know the dizzle<br>
Been underground, now Shuff's back in town, lock up your daughters; Josef Fritzl<br>
But this battle was meant to be last April, honestly<br>
He called it offâ¦ Iâm like, ""What? But mate, you promised me.""<br>
I asked if itâs still happening, heâs like âMaybe. Possiblyâ<br>
Iâve been patiently waiting for this ancient prophesy<br>
Too pussy to actually face me properly<br>
Heâs pissing himself worried that heâll take a loss to me (colostomy)<br>
Itâs taken you three prime ministers and a change of monarchy<br>
Do you understand how many lines I wrote that are now outdated due to your attitude?<br>
Do you understand how many Will Smith/Chris Rock punchlines I had to scrap for you?!<br>
And organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate<br>
It smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday<br>
Weâre having this clash judged too, by performers he would have to know<br>
Because they rap for, YOUR platform â this sports arena that you own<br>
I can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go<br>
This is about as unbiased as Kim Jong Un in a North Korean Talent show<br>
Iâve also seen your battles though â Iâve got you figured out: 'Roids<br>
Simmer down, mate, you should be chilling out, poised<br>
Think about it all he has is a loud voice<br>
But your writingâs more of a shits how than <i>Mrs. Brownâs Boys</i><br>
You hit mid-thirties and went up about six dress sizes<br>
You are a limping, groaning, knuckle-dragging midlife crisis<br>
I donât care whoâs most popular, I care about whoâs the nicest<br>
You have a bigger name than me? So does fucking Isis<br>
Now, I preferred you when you were off the 'roids and thin<br>
But now heâs addicted to working out and itâs poisoned him<br>
You on social media is an extremely annoying thing<br>
My whole Twitter feed is you and Cojay just agreeing you enjoy the gym<br>
I want the stick person that weâve seen, this version baffles me<br>
Wants to wrestle now? Well, I doubt weâll see a big surge in casualties<br>
Such a fake guy heâll only fake fight, heâll inverse to atrophy<br>
Want to wrestle so bad? Go wrestle with your split personality<br>
Iâm praying and I am hoping that by the end of this his head is fixed<br>
Iâm talking to him, since itâs clear a therapist never did<br>
Cause you on social media is nuts<br>
I mean, youâve got this anger that brews<br>
Thereâs different versions of him, these doppelgÃ¤ngers you use<br>
Someone says something you donât like? Heâs gotten mad in a mood<br>
Now, Shottyâs back in the room, youâre not the Adam we knew<br>
This constant angst is problematic, whatâs the matter? Drop the act<br>
This rotten appleâs, gotten bad, heâs lost and tangled, shocking tact, youâre not a man youâre a youth<br>
Thatâs not what adults should do<br>
Acting like everyoneâs against him, what an arrogant view<br>
Like youâre the center of attention? Your logic has to improve<br>
Not everybodyâs a snake, a shocking fact, but itâs true<br>
When you fall out with everyone then the common factor is you<br>
You fuck up relationships the moment you activate a computer<br>
Turning friends you keep into enemies and those actions make you a user<br>
Think St. Patrick's Day, I banish snakes, I am the saint of the future<br>
I keep ahead (a head) of serpents like Perseus decapitating Medusa<br>
So donât let his bullshit blur your vision<br>
Donât be intimidated by a word heâs written<br>
Cause what he writes isnât true like tabloid journalism<br>
So donât be scared, most Horrohâs (horror) stories are a work of fiction<br>
<br>
[Round 2: Shotty Horroh]<br>
He's alright, isn't he?<br>
Probably someone with a case for the top 4<br>
Not many can joke as good as him<br>
You normally know I'm goin' to win<br>
But today...you aren't sure<br>
That's fine<br>
Bastards<br>
He's a formidable opponent<br>
You're just livin' in the moment<br>
That graveyard's been nothin' but rusty chains and locked doors<br>
Until Brizzy said, ""Look Shuffle over"", well then I made space for one more<br>
The most, one dimensional rapper in the scene<br>
For the last ten years he's given us nothin' fresh<br>
Just copies Ricky Gervais' whole shit and makes it rhyme...I'm unimpressed<br>
I don't need to watch a Shuffle battle to tell you what could've happened, it's formulaic, I could've guessed<br>
Funny how you're called ""Shuffle"" when we always know what's comin' next<br>
I catch Shuffle while he teaches his little Rhyme &amp; Rap Beginner classes<br>
Slidin' past the guy who asked for ticket passes<br>
With a knife that's stashed within my jacket<br>
Slicin', drive the jagged shiv I fashioned inside his ab, his liver's splashed<br>
Drive it back<br>
The skin is rugged like the shank it's gettin' traction<br>
You was battlin' bowls of fuckin' Fanta<br>
They kinda clash as mirror matches<br>
Cause you're both full of gas<br>
And the thumb and index is somethin' I can actually twist ya cap with<br>
Try me, try me, try me<br>
Act as if I'm chattin', don't die for rap cause it's in fashion<br>
They wanted Shuffle in the graveyard<br>
Now it's time for Michael Jackson 'Thriller' dances<br>
I heard, ""Shuffle's outside""<br>
Let's get this Muppet outlined<br>
I don't give a fuck about rhymes<br>
I got this <b>gun</b> from 'round mines<br>
Me and my cousin, downsized<br>
It's just us and a brown ride [?]<br>
Foot in his house like, ""Give it up or your pal dies.""<br>
And Marlo stood there like, like, ""I don't mean to trouble you now guys<br>
But I've got lunch at about 5:00 and another function around 9:00<br>
I'm just worried about time<br>
Gun butt him<br>
Outlines<br>
Blood comin' out his mouth like you asked Gunna about slime<br>
Aim at Shuffle, and Shuffle outcries<br>
""Are you guys gonna fuckin' shoot me?!""<br>
{gun cocks}<br>
What does it sound like?<br>
And Marlo stood there...joke<br>
Fuck that! I'm outrageous<br>
If I don't impress Shuffle, I press Shuffle without playlist<br>
I'm the sensei<br>
What's a sensation to an out station<br>
Where would you have gotten without favors? Let's talk foundations<br>
There's a difference between rock bottom and ground breakers<br>
If I would've showed up today without patience, you'd be an outpatient<br>
Ahh<br>
Mortician, Shuffle on the table without Vegas<br>
I am thee, without a doubt greatest<br>
Out of town blazin', an ounce [?]<br>
You're just me, without flavor<br>
Downgraded, outdated<br>
Shotty, Tony, Soul, Kruger, Bizzo, Bobby, Unan', you're about 8ish<br>
Wait, that's without Arkaic, I can't downplay him<br>
Fuck Shuffle T!<br>
I've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements<br>
DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers<br>
You rhyme words together really well<br>
That's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle<br>
That's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle<br>
That's where you seem to struggle<br>
You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle<br>
YOU let him do this with no conviction<br>
Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble<br>
He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle<br>
That's why we don't believe in ya<br>
So many elite MC's that leagues above ya<br>
We don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle<br>
You get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part<br>
I told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card<br>
You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code<br>
Like it's an invincible spell<br>
He thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L<br>
All that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be<br>
If you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well<br>
I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself<br>
Second round in, safe star bless<br>
Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left<br>
<br>
[Round 2: Shuffle T]<br>
<br>
{Shuffle pulls out his phone}<br>
<br>
""Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR?<br>
Yeah it's to deal with well-being and safeguards<br>
2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card<br>
My place of work is Shotty Horrohâs Graveyard<br>
My complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start<br>
I just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar<br>
And I think heâs in denial cause, I know where the graves are<br>
And he always saying that he isn't, but he is running out of space fast<br>
If we ask too many questions he forces us out<br>
He turns up some days and orders us 'round<br>
He was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now<br>
Some are saying he wonât show up<br>
Thatâs what people are saying<br>
It's a hassle, it's a stress, it's havoc, it's a mess<br>
I just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express<br>
And if I ask how they died thatâs a sackable offence<br>
Am I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death?<br>
Iâm calling today cause Iâve just had someone through, Tali<br>
Another hopeless victim<br>
And Iâm looking around and Iâve got no idea for the life of me where Iâm sâposed to fit him<br>
Plot 3?<br>
No thatâs taken. Itâs taken it donât need filling<br>
Well, I can put Tali in there but heâs going to have Tony with him<br>
I get that these things are best handled with stealth<br>
Itâs just - itâs extra stress for me, which is bad for my health<br>
But I guess Iâve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt<br>
What was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help.""<br>
Listen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying<br>
When he does smile, his Face ID doesnât recognize him<br>
That, and you've put on a [?] amount of weight<br>
A bit of padding around the face<br>
You're the man of the house, it's great<br>
I bet your calorie count's insane<br>
But I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised<br>
I don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape<br>
Now, he DID beat me in that film <i>VS</i> â but it was hard for me to lose that<br>
Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, âWe canât really use that<br>
It needs to be WORSE than Shottyâs material, so can you write us a new rap?â<br>
I said, âWORSE than Shottyâs stuffâ¦? I donât know if I can do that.â<br>
In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts<br>
To make my stuff as bad as whatâs coming out that fucking mouth of his<br>
At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit<br>
The director said, âI think weâll need to dumb it down a bit.â<br>
I was in <i>8 Mile</i> as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck<br>
Producer called me personally said, âWe need you for this, Shuffâ<br>
I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut<br>
Apparently, me getting beat wasnât âbelievable enoughâ<br>
Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey<br>
Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry<br>
But itâs an understatement if you're describing me as âhungryâ<br>
Thatâs like calling Ian Huntley a âcheeky monkeyâ<br>
I feel so comfy up here, Iâm winning this in every round<br>
I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown<br>
You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh<br>
We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half<br>
Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you<br>
The second that a battleâs not inside of the M62<br>
I couldâve had this battle in your house in your parentâs living room<br>
And have them both arguing over who theyâd give it to<br>
Your mom gives it to me<br>
So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space<br>
Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mateâs rates<br>
I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay<br>
I donât care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today<br>
Donât get that misconstrued, I mean MY winâs clear on stage<br>
I just donât care about the teams, cause Iâm not 6 years of age<br>
Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million<br>
I am my own worst critic and I think Iâm fucking brilliant!<br>
So fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle<br>
Letâs all see how many puns this cunt has for the word âshuffleâ<br>
Time<br>
<br>
[Round 3: Shotty Horroh]<br>
I mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck<br>
I've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them<br>
As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them<br>
But there's this Joe Pesci notion...<br>
Funny how? If you focusin'<br>
Cause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em<br>
Cause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin'<br>
But you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him<br>
Cause I don't fuck my friends over<br>
You get bad luck from it<br>
Pussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic<br>
Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever<br>
He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure<br>
He's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better<br>
Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together<br>
He does not give a fuck<br>
I've never met anybody as bold as he is<br>
Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the <i>Sound Like</i> show that evenin'?<br>
And he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings<br>
He sat there like, ""What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating<br>
Boys I have Ronan Keating.""<br>
He does not give a fuck, you have to understand<br>
That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys<br>
Without them, I don't think the scene you see today exists<br>
I'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down<br>
I'm just sayin', you ain't legit<br>
Cause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this<br>
Loyal to the soil<br>
I don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz<br>
You don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit<br>
That's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this<br>
Cause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it<br>
And I'm the guy that pays you it<br>
And I did your little panel show for free twice<br>
It was COVID times I let the love persuade me<br>
You couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy<br>
You came at me with the whole ""we're friends"" angle and I [?]<br>
Cause me charging Shuffle shady<br>
Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was ""fuck you pay me""<br>
So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class<br>
These posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps<br>
And wanna turn it into data and a [?]<br>
""Click this link and learn how to be hip hop""<br>
FUCK OFF!<br>
We ain't got the patience for all a dat<br>
For your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed<br>
I didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book<br>
I was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps<br>
People hated, FUCK THAT<br>
I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank<br>
Me versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match<br>
Cause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut<br>
Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious<br>
It's not a joke<br>
Cause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks<br>
It's one of those<br>
Why do your arms look so heavy bro?<br>
I gotta know<br>
You look like every single [?] trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home<br>
Fuckin' strange guy<br>
Lookin' like the little <i>Men In Black</i> alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time<br>
And thank you very much<br>
Another straight, white, male with a podcast<br>
With long hair and edgy jokes<br>
It's fuckin' Russel off-Brand<br>
<br>
That's me, thank you<br>
<br>
[Round 3: Shuffle T]<br>
Now your music has actually been a little different lately<br>
When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady<br>
That <i>Scum Of The Earth</i> album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy<br>
I said, âDo you think you might have ripped them off a bit?â He said âmayyyyyybeeeeeeee!""<br>
I said, âYeah, <i>Definitely Maybe</i><br>
Hereâs what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little'<br>
Then you just 'Roll With It'<br>
Head up in the clouds<br>
I mean he doesnât hear it<br>
It makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about<br>
No oneâs more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound<br>
In fact, I donât believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
'Don't Look Back In Anger'<br>
You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock<br>
Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, itâs not<br>
You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully<br>
But musically, now youâre nowhere near as good as it used to be<br>
Cause when you sell out your art for a dime<br>
Itâll never be far from your mind<br>
Cause when youâve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb<br>
Youâre energy starved and youâll try, but never regrasp on those heights<br>
Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines<br>
And everythingâs harder to rhyme<br>
Integrityâs hard to define<br>
But when you pretend to be part of a life<br>
Of the celebrityâs art that you like<br>
All youâre doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime<br>
So, all youâve actually done is perfected the art of disguise<br>
Thatâs why youâre running out of smoke like a contestant on <i>Stars In Their Eyes</i><br>
Tonight Matthew, Iâm going to shove Noelâs Gallagherâs dick in every hole that it can fit<br>
The only role that you can give, this ainât a cold slap on the wrist<br>
Youâre facing the whole character list of <i>Soul Caliber 6</i><br>
Thatâs why heâs saying shit lines these days like<br>
""It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets"", oh my God, you're such a prick<br>
The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldnât fuck with it<br>
I was just watching with a confused face, I couldnât keep up with it<br>
Not because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit<br>
""Italian blood running the streets"" â Iâll slow down Iâm out maneuvering<br>
I'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring<br>
See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym<br>
I donât give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him<br>
Let me say something simple and make it official<br>
Battle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle<br>
Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme<br>
You make it sound complex but itâs always just the same obnoxious theme<br>
People used to be able to battle in a way theyâd want to speak<br>
Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean?<br>
Every line itâs âI said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?â<br>
Iâm just watching from the side like âMate. It isnât that clever.â<br>
So, I wonât dress this up with word play Iâll just tell you what the truth is<br>
I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit<br>
Your battles arenât that great these days, neither is your music<br>
I think youâre overrated, and I think youâre fuckin' stupid<br>
This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent<br>
You make something simple feel like rocket science<br>
I make rocket science feel like comic timing<br>
Like Hugh Laurie, <i>The Two Ronnies</i> or <i>Monty Python</i><br>
It doesnât make an ounce of difference how you spin it<br>
Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted<br>
I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness<br>
This counterfeited cowardâs limits<br>
Thereâs always praise for you and youâre showered with it<br>
Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit<br>
They put you in the top 4 theyâve mapped out your image<br>
Well, you can have Mount Rushmore Iâll take Mount Olympus<br>
You say Iâm a clown as if it means that Iâm annoyed<br>
I love that reputation, that's my pride and joy<br>
So, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy!<br>
Take that belt to its biting point<br>
Iâll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard youâll have a higher voice than a choirboyâs!<br>
If youâre watching from overseas â watch more UK battle rap<br>
Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, Itâs action packed<br>
Watch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq<br>
Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat!<br>
See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battleâs what I make it<br>
You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips<br>
Youâre an imitator â you see whatâs out there and you claim it<br>
Iâm an innovator â I see whatâs out there and I change it<br>
Time</p>
