"<p>Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'<br>
In the lane, snow is glistenin'<br>
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight<br>
Walking in a Winter Wonderland<br>
<br>
Gone away is the blue bird<br>
Here to stay is the new bird<br>
He's singing our song, as we go along<br>
Walking in a Winter Wonderland<br>
<br>
In the meadow we can build a snowman<br>
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown<br>
He'll say ""Are you married?"", We'll say ""No man<br>
But you can do the job when you're in town.""<br>
<br>
Later on, we'll conspire<br>
As we dream by the fire<br>
To face unafraid, the plans that we made<br>
Walking in a Winter Wonderland<br>
<br>
In the meadow we can build a snowman<br>
And pretend that he's a circus clown<br>
We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman<br>
Until the other kiddies knock him down<br>
<br>
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'<br>
Though you know, kids are chillin'<br>
We'll frolick and play, the Eskimo way<br>
Walking in a Winter Wonderland (wo oh oh ...)<br>
Walking in a Winter Wonderland (wo oh oh ...)<br>
Walking in a Winter Wonderland (wo oh oh ...)<br>
Walking in a Winter Wonderland (wo oh oh ...)<br>

Do I need help, because this ache won't go away?<br>
These shadows on my wall, my only curtain call<br>
The crowd goes silent now<br>
Waiting for you<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Where you at right now? Let me pull up and let's talk about it<br>
I finally got some time alone and I thought about it<br>
I swear to God your love is war, it's so much I can take<br>

Ain't left my hotel in three days, I feel sick without you, sick without you<br>

"<p>[Round 1: B. Dot]<br>
Ayo!<br>
B. Dot on URL? Well, it's not a dream<br>
What you heard is real<br>
I'm one of the best in the GAME!<br>
I mean, y'all all heard of the name and observed the skill<br>
I'm feeling like Daylyt vs. Mike P<br>
It's my time to shine 'cause I earned the deal<br>
Except I'm only licking the ground after the shot and his body drop to confirm the kill!<br>
I snuck in a steel Ruger<br>
But still sharp with the hands: the real Kreuger<br>
Aye, I read Rum went to the East with fake J's!<br>
That's backwards: it'll be MURDER if I pull up with real shooters!<br>
Them Piru-ers, and I got some Crip niggas in all blue, homie<br>
As far as weapons, I got a few on me<br>
Aye, it was animated 'til I drew on him<br>
With the long nose that I used to think was despicable...'til it grew on me!<br>
Aye, who want me?<br>
They said a nigga named E.K., he the preacher type<br>
Well, don't believe the hype<br>
You had a whole video running through the streets<br>
But running the streets get niggas locked: that is NOT the key to life<br>
You from Utah!? I'm from Pacoima!<br>
We don't even breathe alike!<br>
For l'il homies in MY hood, whacking out rival gangs is the way they learned to read and write!<br>
My breathing right<br>
I'm 'bout to lock on this nigga like Cujo<br>
He wanna switch sides and switch teams to sell tix?<br>
Aye, do what you do, bro!<br>
Just know the King don't need a PG<br>
I got no problem letting two go!<br>
But you know!<br>
URL tricky: yeah, they lie to the true, bro!<br>
Tricked me into doing a PG<br>
Yeah, they clowned in a loophole<br>
But it's cool, though! Give 'em kudos!<br>
They assisting the new Manute Bol<br>
Thought they was throwing me a bounce pass<br>
I turned this to a alley-oop, though!<br>
You gotta shoot, bro!<br>
Bar Code: a bunch of dirty niggas from the group home<br>
Get beat 'til you're black and blue: whip two tone<br>
If I say we warrin', G, I ain't talking 'bout the nigga that put Snoop on!<br>
These bullets fly for cheap<br>
I could make this count for the whole crew like it's Groupon!<br>
""Aye, B. Dot, what you on!?""<br>
Well, you know how this crowd do it<br>
This URL! You gotta give 'em the same shit<br>
You know, a bunch of ""BOW!"" movements!<br>
Don't tell me that sound stupid, a conscious brother holding a gun<br>
I mean, in order to know where I'm at, don't you niggas gotta know where I'm from?<br>
See, it wasn't always about the ""God raps""<br>
You gotta go beyond that<br>
In order to tell a vision, you gotta channel the inner wisdom, and look at the contrast!<br>
I grew up bangin', but changed my life in a big way<br>
Shout out to Loso!<br>
Just know, though, I saved myself, I ain't get saved<br>
I grew up punching niggas in the mouth for acting bitch-made, and ain't shit changed<br>

You 'bout to get sprayed<br>
I mean, you RIGHT IN THE SPOT where your homies got you left out<br>
I was searching the Tube, lurking for views<br>
Scanning the Bar Code, and nothing really checked out!<br>
Diesel, what your rep 'bout?<br>
My niggas from family said you 'bout as good as a ghost<br>
I mean, all you do is troll on Facebook<br>
Now your name makes sense: Diesel was only good in the post!<br>
When I look at you both, nothing really SCREAM y'all clappin' in most cases<br>
I mean, we can try and mask it<br>
But when it come down to the action, bro and son just actin' like Ghostfaces<br>
I mean, fuck a scrap! We can clap!<br>
If you ain't the homie, the lives is getting taken<br>
But if the family feud, we'll put up the tool<br>
The arm can go behind the back before we get it shakin'!<br>
But, for you, you get robbed<br>
The homies shoot with no hesitation<br>
And I'll assist with the jack<br>
Son, we move in unison: Rhythm Nation!<br>
I figured hatin'<br>
So, I brought two straps for the situation<br>
This a Colt, and this'll zip you up for all that tongue: two different Paytons!<br>
Fuck what we sayin'! He only telling truth 'bout a few things!<br>
<a href=""/14506761/Urltv-b-dot-vs-emerson-kennedy/I-mean-e-lie-man-and-all-that-giant-talks-gon-get-you-is-two-rings"" data-id=""14506761"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">I mean, E lie, man, and all that giant talk's gon' get you is two rings!</a><br>
He said he Muslim? Oh, I HEARD he Muslim!?<br>
That's cool, King! Well, I'm here to take what you got<br>
You get robbed on your prayer rug<br>
I heard what you're making's a lot<br>
You gon' be taking these shots, when hollow-tips tarnishin' your fellowship Parliament<br>
Every time you speak, we'll applaud your shit<br>
That just means you'll get clapped for every word, like a ghetto chick arguin'!<br>
I don't CARE if Allah with him!<br>
I got three homies with me, rolling up<br>
And each one got a .44 we clutch<br>
So, that's four .44's, just in case Hova wanna open up!<br>
I throw it up, and let my Killah Bees swarm on him<br>
Feeling like a freak on a leash: I turn Korn on him<br>
Putting these machines together, I transform on him<br>
They saying he got tunnel vision, I blow the HORN on him!<br>
It's MUSIC to my EARS when niggas get stretched out like accordions<br>
According to the gossip, they said you'll hop in an Accord to get away from the shottas<br>
But if we find ya, you'll be in the street, fighting for your LIFE!<br>
You won't believe how many arms we'll have on E Honda!<br>
Time!<br>
<br>
[Round 1: Emerson Kennedy]<br>
That's a classic first round!<br>
And y'all wondering if E write as hard<br>
Maybe not...promise to God I will NEVER have a <i>Street Fighter</i> bar!<br>
I guarantee it!<br>
B. Dot, what are you in search of? Little fame from this battle rap?<br>
Or do you TRULY require a change in your habitat?<br>
'Cause you an activist on this rapping shit, but how do you prioritize?<br>
<strong>Eliminating</strong> guns and <strong>illuminating</strong> guns in all those rounds that you glorify!<br>
Are you really reppin' they word?<br>
I don't have NO gun shit!<br>
I don't have NO gun shit!<br>
Are you really reppin' they word, or just reinforcing the negative lessons they've learned?<br>
When your community ask for action, are you...too busy preppin' for Aye Verb?<br>
Am I wrong, nigga!? Say word!<br>
'Cause you making niggas foreheads' split<br>
While your community losing lives to the same pump you threaten Cortez with!?<br>
Nigga, WHAT?!<br>
That's why yo' conscience is irrelevant<br>
If you just got a gun line for your benefit<br>
That's OVERSIGHT, of trying to be a celebrity OVERNIGHT<br>
All we really hear is the violence through the end of it<br>
Nigga, hold on-!<br>
Catch up! Catch UP!<br>
But I got a story to tell 'bout certain parts of my town<br>
I grew up a screw-up, hypnotized by the cars and the sounds<br>
And now I'm going...going...back to Cali, just to take part of his crown<br>
That didn't even seem hot<br>
I was on my B. Dot: using B.I.G. words to make up for lack of BARS IN HIS ROUNDS!!<br>
Nigga, HOLD ON!<br>
And y'all was starting to doubt him<br>
Traffic, and I wouldn't play a part in this outcome?<br>
I'm sorry, this ain't for the West<br>
It's for the ancestors who never saw Martin vs. Malcolm!<br>
Nigga, hold on!<br>
And the FANS start to tout him<br>
Over at LABG, they said there was something about him<br>
Before Cortez on KOTD, where he rapped <strong>three rounds of gun lines</strong>, with a little substance at the end<br>
And this who you put faith in to have conscience coming from his pen?<br>
Vers' Danny, he spoke to the Black QUEENS<br>
On just how far choosing the right man could take them<br>
Then, his next time in the ring<br>
He sound like all them niggas he warned y'all to stay AWAY FROM!<br>
And that's why he-<br>
FACTS! <strong>FACTS!</strong><br>
And that's why he's lost in the noise<br>
Cause that shows the cost of your choice<br>
Your wordplay skill only got you a mermaid deal<br>
Career got legs but <strong>it lost you your voice</strong>!<br>
Nigga, hold on!<br>
And that's so blatant, and now B. Dot raps so flagrant<br>
You went from ""stay truest"" to Ray Lewis, B. Dot, and that's so Raven<br>
I mean, Smack, why is it ""support the black business"" until it comes to his rap interest?<br>
Cause we've been building up black Smack presence<br>
While he's KOTD and dance sessions<br>
Shuckin' and jivin' for Organik, showin' how B. Dot shoot<br>
Look brother, we supposed to eat organic, not watch him eat off you!<br>
I'mma FUCK HIM UP!<br>
This is Smack, right!? This ain't KOTD!<br>
This ain't KOTD, this is Smack, and I stay with this business<br>
And that mind state was defenseless<br>
You know not to trust crackers with K in the name of they business!<br>
And I was ashamed when I witnessed<br>
You lettin' straps into your speech?<br>
And this was after you had grabbed all the blacks that you could reach<br>
How does an activist flip back to the tactics of the weak<br>
While he's practicing gun bars instead of ""practice what your preach!?""<br>
But he gon' say, ""But I'm not black, I'm just a geek.""<br>
And I never have to prove that curve<br>
But I thought whites calling me ""nigga"" and some niggas from my right to even use that word<br>
You can't use what you used on Verb<br>
No fake threats just to hurt you<br>
I'm glad his third eye open: I plan on swelling shut the first two!<br>
Nigga hold on!<br>
But the aim's not to attack you, the aim's to adapt you<br>
Take his progression as a lesson B. Dot, religion's a vaccum<br>
I was reading math books while he's arguing the book of Matthew<br>
Telling Christian's that Satan's fake and now he's fuckin' lookin' at you!<br>
Charles I just want to ask you<br>
What's it like having a conscious community supportin' your battles?<br>
Or all of Los Angeles in unity that's ready to back you?<br>
If that's embellished it's just cause I'm jealous cause they gon' build B. Dot a statue<br>
And I don't have a nigga to take a bullet for me cause all of them actually had to, nigga hold on!<br>
I was that bad black kid, doin' what the Black Masks did<br>
<a href=""/14515866/Urltv-b-dot-vs-emerson-kennedy/Passin-rocks-in-front-and-back-of-me-i-was-the-original-backpack-kid"" data-id=""14515866"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Passin' rocks in front and back of me: I was the original Backpack Kid</a><br>
Nigga, hold on!<br>
Nigga I come from the blocks where the cops plantin' somethin' in your spot<br>
So the PG's L.A. football: nigga, you get the charges whether you want them or not!<br>
Nigga, hold on!<br>
<br>
[Round 2: B. Dot]<br>
Here we go again<br>
A nigga get in front of me, get conscious and want to break me down, well we gotta go beyond that<br>
You from Utah, you the most white washed nigga on Smack<br>
But gettin' back to the gangsta shit<br>
I find out where the enemy stay and catch him while he pick up his dame<br>
I mean they in the whip goin' over the pass, you know she ask him about some distant exchange<br>
Well the texts is 'bout to take 'em both back down memory lane<br>
With a head shot, baow!<br>
Oh nah sis' in the back of the whip pickin' Kennedy's brain<br>
I get him with range, I know how to be a sprayer<br>
No forensic files gettin' left, your body gettin' swept, the autopsy missin' data<br>
I'm a hit man tellin' detectives to holla at me later<br>
A clean marksman can aim at the target and get him caught by<br>
Puttin' all these bitchin' in one spot like it's How To Be A Player<br>
With the new silencer<br>
And with that thing on, you barely can hear a sound<br>
With that rubber grip that stop the kickback like your parents came home early from out of town<br>
Look who I found<br>
A fuckin' clown that's half white half black, I'm guessin' that pressure is heavy<br>
Wait, your brain tryin' to rap, you're trapped<br>
Between bein' a college spoiled brat in a frat<br>
Or a young black strapped with a gat, pants saggin' to the back<br>
You're tryin' to blend in wit your raps<br>
In every one of your rounds you attach a reference about one of your niggas who claps<br>
It's always, ""You know it's one of my niggas"" that did this and did that<br>
You're commentatin' on another player game but never give us your stats<br>
You're 'bout to collapse<br>
Don't know if he was sober when he told ya but we can blame this on 'gnac<br>
He sent you on the attack<br>
I'm on the defensive end<br>
Eh, nephew your uncle Tom, Brady 'bout to get sacked<br>
And thanks to The Patriot Act I got the IP address to where the information is stacked<br>
So if it's all in your brain, I'll send somebody Anonymous to get your cranium hacked<br>
Nigga you back?<br>
For what? We been sayin' you wack<br>
Heard you had a vaca' in Iraq<br>
The western conference been on the prowl but somehow you strayed from the pack<br>
Ended up way in the back<br>
I mean way way in the back<br>
Thought he was royalty, Jay with the raps<br>
Well t king dumb, come get faded to black<br>
Nigga you should be faded for that<br>
Tryin' to piggyback off the movement<br>
We had been bangin' for that<br>
<a href=""/14507147/Urltv-b-dot-vs-emerson-kennedy/Now-theres-a-wide-margin-between-us-i-mean-it-keyshia-coles-dentist-couldnt-bring-in-the-gap"" data-id=""14507147"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Now there's a wide margin between us, I mean it<br>
Keyshia Cole's dentist couldn't bring in the gap</a><br>
I mean, what happened wit him?<br>
When I got started in the west this was the cat to mention<br>
You was a rappin' henchmen but you been movin' backwards since then<br>
Act indifferent, stagnant, trippin'<br>
Everything about the average written trash you spittin' just lacks conviction<br>
Say you put on for the west but only put on your best when you think it'll get Smack's attention<br>
We just rappin' different<br>
I give a fuck about another nigga name<br>
You claim Jay your idol, well create your own title, don't ride another nigga wave<br>
Nigga you went from a One Off to a PG, you another nigga's slave<br>
You got this backwards, this ain't no PG, I did this off GP, I'm the one that's gettin' paid<br>
Nigga you're gettin' sprayed<br>
Watch how I aim the thing and flame your scene<br>
I turn your world upside down my nigga<br>
It'll be nothin' but ashes and you ain't never seen Stranger Things<br>
I'll have the crew come through with the blade and things<br>
Go across your stomach and shave your spleen<br>
The irony, that tellin' a nigga, ""Aye! If you don't wanna get cut then don't make the team""<br>
I'm amazing king<br>
Why swerve when I'm[?] on a three way street?<br>
<a href=""/14515942/Urltv-b-dot-vs-emerson-kennedy/Yeah-we-look-at-the-chart-we-checked-out-your-heart-i-dont-wanna-hear-none-of-yall-murmur-that-ek-g"" data-id=""14515942"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Yeah we look at the chart we checked out your heart<br>
I don't wanna hear none of y'all murmur that EK, G</a><br>
Yeah they checked us at the door but we still got the burners through<br>

I got the flame near the foot like I'm on a 2K streak<br>
This nigga weak<br>
I don't wanna hear no Black Panther speech<br>
Nigga, yo' bitch is white and you white-washed<br>
Where I'm from, we don't add the bleach<br>
I'll fuck you up<br>
We can catch the fade til my knuckles bust<br>

Aye! URL is where the gangsta shit at<br>
I don't wanna hear all that conscious word today nigga<br>
<br>
[Round 2: Emerson Kennedy]<br>
He doesn't want me do Panther bars cause I date a Caucasian, you screamed that in my fuckin' face<br>
Well I date a white girl, you get a right curl, we both in the sunken place<br>
Nigga hold on!<br>
He says I'm always sayin' how it's one of my niggas who got the blammer<br>
You right, and an OG taught me never to admit that shit on camera<br>
Nigga hold on<br>
That's two of them thangs<br>
I was carefully drafted in the new wave<br>
Just to conjure a new classic to the page<br>
When they gave me the hope seller, felt like Coachella<br>
Only time I'm not worried about traffic in L.A<br>
You think you've mastered what to say?<br>
So the conscious is thankin' him<br>
You don't support black banks and them, so they won't put me on the rank with him<br>
But that means he's a customer, I'm a hustler<br>
Y'all gon' have to walk plank wit him<br>
For trustin' a nigga that sees Hamilton more than one that sees Franklins<br>
And that's why, and he's bankin' on the fact that it's his knowledge I fear<br>
You talkin' selfies with books lodged to your ear<br>
Is B. Dot's first novel idea<br>
Boy I mix what you call illegal but still mournin' for my people<br>
I ran this check up on KG just to send the money to Puerto Rico<br>
But I'm a man over a thug, right?<br>
But tonight, it's Black African power<br>
Well, tonight, it's another plan<br>
I put a horse head in his bed spread the same shape as the motherland<br>
Nigga hold on<br>
And I'm a man over a thug<br>
Raised by the scammers and the drugs<br>
You ever tripped over your cell phone charger? My niggas really ran up on the plug<br>
Boy forget about the bud, get your mind up out the club<br>
I avoided pig but every meal I had to get up out the mud<br>
And you ain't [?] about the hub<br>
Cause New York got you stressin'<br>
I got a W on that New York stage throwin' W's, nigga reppin'<br>
I beat a Brooklyn nigga in Brooklyn, see that dawg ain't up in you<br>
Cause I flew 6,000 miles to beat a nigga that could walk to the venue<br>
And I stay that way<br>
While you stay at bay<br>
You can't take flight on Kennedy bein' scared to land at JFK<br>
Nigga hold on<br>
See you can't master what is right, until you step out of class to set the fight<br>
All those books you read can't get you past this chapter in your life<br>
See New York tells me they doubtin' you<br>
When I'm there I tell them I'm proud of you<br>
Cause on the east I hold him down, on the west I hold you accountable<br>
Nigga hold on<br>
That's cause I'm loyal to my soil, even when preparin' for battle<br>
<a href=""/14516630/Urltv-b-dot-vs-emerson-kennedy/Do-you-believe-in-adam-and-eve-nigga-then-why-you-so-scared-of-the-apple"" data-id=""14516630"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Do you believe in Adam and Eve?<br>
Nigga, then why you so scared of The Apple?</a><br>
And you had to! And B. Dot had to to skip the Proving Ground<br>
He was lettin' the fame hurt you<br>
Don't you know cuttin' corners put you in that same circle?<br>
What a shame? Hurtful<br>
Come to grips with the truth<br>
You'd rather sit on the roof than fight and sit with the troops<br>
You never put mileage on your car, just to put chips on your tooth<br>
You ain't Superman, you Wonder Woman, nigga ya whip tells the truth<br>
Hold on<br>
Boy, stop with the pride and only sendin' shots from this side<br>
Goin' to the east makes you a beast<br>
Only thing you provin' is that you not gonna ride<br>
I proved I won't fold on the road and this is not the 405<br>
B. Dot the only fast track means you gotta have a little box in your drove<br>
You know what I'm sayin'<br>
That was crazy, I'm unbreakable, unfadeable<br>
Your fate? Is replaceable<br>
I'm erasin' the fate of father to show my mom that I'm capable<br>
You chasin' a fade with Saga just to have a debatable<br>
You chase the fade with Saga to show him who he's been prayin' to<br>
I'm a god vs a facade who won't put the ratchets down<br>
Y'all cheer him talkin' 'bout blastin' rounds<br>
I'm only empowerin' caps and gowns<br>
See we had masters then I got my masters, I turned that back around<br>
We was brought here on slave ships...look at me, I'm the captain now<br>
They gon' capture your rounds and turn it into a clip that goes viral<br>
B. Dot in ten years they gon' capture my rounds and turn it into a bible!<br>
This ain't even a rival<br>
They say the teachers incredible because of the reach on the pedestal and how he speak to the head of you<br>
I never been a teacher's pet, you see you leeches is terrible<br>
Go ahead and bring him an apple I'm just gon' leave him a vegestable<br>
And that's how I achieve, what I achieve is incredible<br>
Where they find me at?<br>
....Is that time? No, this is the West, nigga, gimme my time to rap!<br>
Hold on<br>
I was homeless in a hooptie: rusty Pontiac<br>
All hunger with no slumber, you know how your conscious act<br>
When you skip sleepin' for a weekend, you just stuck in the car and rap<br>
What I'm sayin' is: Don't talk that woke shit to a fuckin' insomniac<br>
Nigga the bomb is back!<br>

EK, this ain't even about competition<br>
Look my nigga you charged with bein' a slave to the URL system<br>
Think of this as a film inquisition<br>
I'm 'bout to give you a chance to make sure you don't dance around these topics during your deposition<br>
True or false: you flew to the east on your own cost<br>
Battled Jerry Wess then lost<br>
Was supposed to be the future, with the Mask on<br>
Smokin'<br>
But ended up bein' regular Jim Carrey with it off<br>
Then you never got the call<br>
That couldn't happen to me I'm very much a boss<br>
They didn't want me to battle Cor'<br>
They said, ""Well make him give you the other half back""<br>
Lyin', that's a battle they couldn't block<br>
Then they tried to change the pitch but I already scored six, shit I'm Barry with the toss<br>
Against Cali, you went off, but you still wasn't on<br>
I mean you battled YK in The Bay they say you tried to stay a bit too long<br>
I mean they told you when to go, stupid<br>
Ya dumb? They wasn't playin' you a song<br>
This ain't just about you there's a few involved<br>
West coast niggas, what they do to y'all?<br>
This ain't food for thought<br>
I mean it's stickin' to the plate just so they can say, ""Aye! Y'all sleep on it we'll get it off at the break of dawn.""<br>
That's when your brain gets washed<br>
What's what we came here for?<br>
Now you niggas switchin' ya ways while I'm still N.W.A<br>
I'm sure y'all remember them days<br>
Imagine if Eazy, Dre or Ren would've say ""This L.A. shit ain't gettin' us paid. We need to switch up and change.""<br>
Nah, instead they paved the way, created lanes for all the shit that we say<br>
Ain't nothin' different today<br>
We could've done the same thing with battle rap<br>
Instead y'all folded, let out-of-towners come in and promote it<br>
Now, we don't even got a hand in that<br>
We could've won L.A<br>
By ourselves we could've got this done L.A<br>
But y'all kept sayin' we needed AIDS so they sent the nigga from Michigan to come run LA<br>
This could've been Magic<br>
Instead it's URL: Traffic<br>
Tragic<br>
But hold on to this, grasp it<br>
This the closest y'all gon' get to a west coast Summer Madness<br>
Then I'm passed this<br>
I'm just up here statin' the facts<br>
This is the cheapest I've ever been paid for a match<br>
But I thank you for that<br>
I ain't like I'm some king on the throne<br>
I just guess King Of The Dot treated me the same way y'all treated Charron<br>
You know a white boy with confederate flags wavin' a Mag is what you condone<br>
But got me up here in front of this Utah nigga talkin' all this Jazz<br>
While my stock ten times better than his and he's assisting Malone?<br>
""Well, you know, Charron, he skipped the PG's cause he built his prestige as a rapper.""<br>
""Yeah on King Of The Dot, I thought this was the only league that matters.""<br>
""Oh you know with Charron he got millions of views when we tallied up the amount.""<br>
""Yeah on King Of The Dot. I thought this was the only league that counts.""<br>
What is this really about?<br>
Is this some ego thing cause y'all dealin' with a nigga wit' clout?<br>
Cause I led the league with the greatest perception without a pass from y'all cause I stuck to my routes?<br>
Oh I figured you out<br>
I'm supposed to be happy to be on this stage, of course you Smack<br>
Look, I support black business but black business gotta support you back<br>
Back in the PG's just happy to be promoted<br>
Y'all notice he retired from battle rap, got rehired by Smack but then demoted<br>
You bogus<br>
You up here sleep walkin', losin' focus<br>
I'm swingin' on you, left and right, you gettin' clocked out of hypnosis<br>
But let's focus<br>
On these money hungry league owners<br>
Beasley had a problem with Diz' sayin' ""nigga""...well that's what he told us<br>
But let's expose this cause I was like ""Oh that's wild""<br>
I guess as long as you gettin' Money Bagz you'll allow a white boy to say ""nigga"" on your stage in front of an all black crowd<br>
Shit is foul<br>
And y'all don't see the manipulation<br>
I mean your fans don't ever say shit<br>
Look, I rock with Roc but even look how they plan Tay shit<br>
They got him locked up caged in<br>
Can't go to the other leagues and get the cheese, that don't make sense<br>
I mean, is he being rewarded<br>
Or is this the same trick that got us boarded on the slave ship from that European invasion<br>
Capitalism, they ain't change it<br>
The old master say, ""You niggas ain't goin' nowhere""<br>
New masters say, ""It only matters on this plantation.""<br>
This is basic and y'all don't even think to condemn it<br>
Yeah they tell you you a free slave until they hit you with that Thirteenth Ammendment<br>
Then your ass stuck in prison lookin' for a deacon or a pastor<br>
Look, I don't know what's worse, workin' for the white man or workin' for your black brother that think he your master<br>
I'm just closin' this chapter<br>
Ain't no turnin' back for me<br>
I did this for Loso, Jimz and all of them that don't have to do this after me<br>
I mean, don't lose your integrity lettin' these niggas lock you down<br>
Claimin' the PG is the master key<br>
I'm from the west, I'm only here to see Dizaster tweek<br>
Ayo Roc, I hope they paid you a lot my nigga cause LA gas ain't cheap<br>
This is the west! We started gangsta rap, I'm gon' need our thanks for that<br>
Yeah I know the east started rap, cool, we not claimin' that<br>
But if URL is about gang bangin' slangin' crack and bangin' straps<br>
Well then bitch, LA is where it should be stationed at!</a><br>
<br>
[Round 3: Emerson Kennedy]<br>
If you had that big of a problem with Smack....<br>
Why didn't you start your black business and hit us with that grown talk?<br>
He's gon' say, ""I was busy. I was...it's Charron fault.""<br>
Hold on nigga, hold on<br>
B. Dot we got shit to work through and the aim is never to hurt you<br>
But can we reverse to, your verse two angle, on that Verb tangle<br>
When you said some shit I took a little personal<br>
How you said Aye Verb's daddy struck his mama and that's what changed his identity<br>
Cause he was then raised by that single mama and that's why the change in femininity<br>
But what about the change in yo' energy?<br>
I mean, when did your tales of talkin' get derailed so often?<br>
When did domestic abuse become B. Dot's next best excuse to call a nigga frail and mock him?<br>
When did callin' Verb ""gay"" for two rounds just cause a female had taught him<br>
Outweigh the significance of a female raisin' a nigga that's not in jail or a coffin<br>
Cause I was single mother raised and I got memories of pops hittin' on her<br>
But when you downplay single mother's success that's you just shittin' on her<br>
See you said Verb got head rolls and finger snaps<br>
<br>
[B. Dot]<br>
Facts. He did<br>
<br>
[Emerson Kennedy]<br>
But that to me was kind of scary<br>
Cause that black woman stereotype is only used by Fox News and Tyler Perry<br>
And that's why I'm kinda leery, and dissecting what you did<br>
You preferred Verb's mom parasailing, niggas shiftin' through the crib<br>
So when Verb's a little kid, he's got father figures now<br>
But they just fuck moms and tuck arms so Verb won't put the trigger down<br>
And now he's grabbin' weapons in adolescence and if that don't put him in the ground<br>
The fate he earns, the trait he learned from them and that's to never stick around<br>
And then that cycle starts over, and that night you became that promoter<br>
When you went at Verb's weight and dismissed the weight that's on his mother's shoulders<br>
See I don't even know if he like knew you<br>
But that made me wonder if B. Dot truthful<br>
Cause sayin' a female would raise a trans-parent made me see right through you<br>
Nigga hold on<br>
See I'm not just teachin' lessons<br>
But you sayin' females suggest the affection of a boy<br>
It's not toys, the biggest gift you give as a parent is just bein' present<br>
And that's all that should matter<br>
But your antiquated thoughts confuse the data<br>
Cause you only have the perspective of a male and no mom but that's what causes the cancer<br>
And you supposed to have the thoughts of a Panther, but your words hold us back<br>
See masculinity ain't man's destiny to shoot fades or hold a strap<br>
It's just being comfortable with who you are, but you drifted far from knowin' that<br>
See men treat all with respect but check niggas who don't show it back<br>
Don't think I ain't notice that<br>
All that hate you was tellin' him<br>
I think it's significant B. Dot, can't embrace what is feminine<br>
So if you have a prescription to his diction just cause he speaks about race and the melanin<br>
Just remember, never trust a doctor who don't like the taste of his own medicine<br>
And that's why I'm ahead of him<br>
Cause I know the [?] of a father<br>
I prefer Terrance have two parents, but I know that raisin' is harder<br>
I took care of my sis' hurtin' when moms was workin' and couldn't embrace one of her daughters<br>
So bein' raised by a woman didn't make me woman, nigga it made me a father!<br>
So hold on<br>
It made me a father, I had to embrace what was harder<br>
But you speakin' on punk shit, your female fans should jump ship<br>
For takin' that angle on young kids<br>
Versus Danny you told women who to date and who not to fuck wit<br>
I'm just tellin' those women who looks down on him and who really up lifts<br>
Diesel brings his daughter to my crib<br>
And we let her just draw, right?<br>
We don't talk gang shit, we watch our language cause he knows that's how she's best off<br>
So similar to when these niggas hop in each other's battles<br>
Say one line to prevent loss<br>
....<br>
If something happens to Diesel I pick up right where you left off<br>
Nigga and that's facts<br>
And that's why you just lost<br>
Cause you tryin' to walk that fine line of black activist/Einstein<br>
And using gay angles from Grind Time<br>
When Lux said ""yo' pops ain't no gangsta"", that one stayed on my mind<br>
Cause he said ""He's just another lost nigga"" and I spent years tryin' to find mine<br>
But hold on, that's just the luck of the stuck<br>
And being in a rut as a mutt<br>
Maybe you're right, I didn't have a father to toughen me up<br>
Cause I get emotional when you insinuate that my mother's a crutch<br>
Cause my mother raised a nigga that's currently fuckin' you up!<br>
Nigga that's right<br>
And I know that this battle shit confuses you<br>
But I'm a fan of B. Dot cause I feel battle rap is in a jam<br>
I was hopin' he'd 3-0 me<br>
I know to be the GOAT sometime you gotta be the sacrificial lamb<br>
Nigga hold on</p>

Si estoy con ella no es un crimen<br>
Y yo voy, voy, voy<br>
Ella hace todo por seducirme<br>
Y yo voy, voy, voy<br>
Haciendo lo que ella me pide<br>
Y yo voy, voy, voy<br>
Porque fue la que siempre quise<br>
Y yo voy, voy, voy<br>
Si estoy con ella no es un crimen<br>
Y yo voy, voy, voy<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""La Bachata""]<br>
<br>
[Verso 1]<br>
Te bloqueé de Insta, pero por otra cuenta veo tus historias (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
Tu número lo borré; no sé pa' qué si me lo sé de memoria<br>
Me hiciste daño, y así te extraño<br>
Y aunque sé que un día te voy a olvidar<br>
Aún no lo hago, es complicado<br>
To' lo que hicimo' me gusta recordar<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste<br>
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste<br>
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide<br>
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide<br>
Porque ando manejando por las calles que me besaste<br>
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste<br>
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide<br>
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide, eh<br>
<br>
[Verso 2]<br>
Que me cuide de otra que se parezca a ti<br>
No quiero caer como hice por ti<br>
Ojalá te enamore, te haga lo mismo que me hiciste a mí<br>
Tú me enseñaste a no amar a cualquiera<br>
Y también cómo no quiero que me quieran<br>
No-oh-oh, éramos tres en una relación de dos<br>
No te perdono, pídele perdón a Dios<br>
Dije que te olvidé y la verdad e' que yo-oh-oh<br>
Yo-oh-oh<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste<br>
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste<br>
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide<br>
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide<br>
Porque ando manejando por las calles que me besaste<br>
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste<br>
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide<br>
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide, eh<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""La Bachata""]<br>
<br>
[Verso 1]<br>
Te bloqueé de Insta, pero por otra cuenta veo tus historias (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
Tu número lo borré; no sé pa' qué si me lo sé de memoria<br>
Me hiciste daño, y así te extraño<br>
Y aunque sé que un día te voy a olvidar<br>
Aún no lo hago, es complicado<br>
To' lo que hicimo' me gusta recordar<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste<br>
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste<br>
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide<br>
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide<br>
Porque ando manejando por las calles que me besaste<br>
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste<br>
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide<br>
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide, eh<br>
<br>
[Verso 2]<br>
Que me cuide de otra que se parezca a ti<br>
No quiero caer como hice por ti<br>
Ojalá te enamore, te haga lo mismo que me hiciste a mí<br>
Tú me enseñaste a no amar a cualquiera<br>
Y también cómo no quiero que me quieran<br>
No-oh-oh, éramos tres en una relación de dos<br>
No te perdono, pídele perdón a Dios<br>
Dije que te olvidé y la verdad e' que yo-oh-oh<br>
Yo-oh-oh<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste<br>
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste<br>
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide<br>
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide<br>
Porque ando manejando por las calles que me besaste<br>
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste<br>
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide<br>
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide, eh<br>

<br>
[Intro: Quevedo]<br>
(Perreamos toda la noche y nos dormimo' a las die')<br>
Llegué al club con el combo, rápido la vi lejos<br>
Se pintaba los labios y la copa como espejo<br>
Se acercó poco a poco y yo queriendo que me baile<br>
Luego me dijo: ""Vamos, que te enseño Buenos Aire'""<br>
<br>
[Refrán: Quevedo]<br>
Y nos fuimos en una, empezamo' a la una<br>
Y con la nota rápido nos dieron las tre'<br>
Perreamos toda la noche y nos dormimo' a las die'<br>
Ando rezándole a Dios pa' repetirlo otra ve'<br>
Y nos fuimos en una, empezamo' a la una<br>
Y con la nota rápido nos diеron las tre'<br>
Perreamos toda la nochе y nos dormimo' a las diez<br>
Ando rezándole a Dios pa' repetirlo otra ve' (Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh)<br>
<br>
[Verso 1: Quevedo]<br>
Dime, beba<br>
Fecha y hora y te paso a buscar<br>
Yo le llego donde los demás tú sabes que no le llegan<br>
Ruido de botellas de champán de las copas al brindar<br>
Pero solo escucho cómo late (Eh-eh, eh-eh)<br>
Mi corazón cuando veo ese cuerpo 'e escaparate<br>
El traje combina con la Mercede' granate<br>
No hay otro por más que ellos traten (Yeah)<br>
<br>
[Estribillo: Quevedo]<br>
Quédate<br>
Que las noches sin ti duelen<br>
Tengo en la mente las pose' y todos los gemido'<br>
Que ya no quiero nada que no sea contigo<br>
Quédate<br>
Que las noches sin ti due-e-e-e-len<br>
Tengo en la mente las pose' y todo lo que hicimo'<br>
Que ya no quiero nada que no sea contigo<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Quevedo]<br>
Dale, guacha, suelta (Suelta)<br>
Vente pa' Canaria' sin el equipaje y sin viaje de vuelta<br>
Por la isla te vo'a dar una vuelta<br>
Bebé, solo avisa<br>
El sábado teteo, el domingo misa<br>
Estoy a ver si me garantiza'<br>
Que te me pegas como quien graba con Biza<br>
Y vi salir a las amigas del party y ella se quedó<br>
Mirándonos a los ojo', no al reloj<br>
(Y nos fuimos en) Uber al apartamento<br>
En privado me pedía que le diera un concierto<br>
Le dije que por meno' de un beso no canto<br>
<br>
[Refrán: Quevedo]<br>
Y nos fuimos en una, empezamo' a la una<br>
Y con la nota rápido nos dieron las tre'<br>
Perreamos toda la noche y nos dormimo' a las die'<br>

<br>
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, <i>Mike Shinoda &amp; Chester Bennington</i>]<br>
One thing, I don't know why<br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme<br>

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings</a><br>
Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
The clock ticks life away, <i>it's so unreal</i><br>
Didn't look out below<br>
Watch the time go right out the window<br>
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know<br>
I wasted it all just to <i>watch you go</i><br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]<br>
I kept everything inside<br>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br>

One thing (One thing), I don't know why<br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme<br>
To remind myself how <i>I tried so hard</i><br>
In spite of the way you were mockin' me<br>
Actin' like I was part of your property<br>
Remembering all the times you fought with me<br>
I'm surprised it <i>got so far</i><br>
Things aren't the way they were before<br>
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore<br>
Not that you knew me back then<br>
But it all comes back to me <i>in the end</i><br>

"<p>[Chorus 1: Meghan Trainor &amp; <i>Brett Eldredge</i>]<br>
I really can't stay<br>
<i>But baby it's cold outside</i><br>
I got to go away<br>
<i>But baby it's cold outside</i><br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor &amp; Brett Eldredge]<br>
This evening has been<br>
<i>Been hoping that you'd drop in</i><br>
So very nice<br>
<i>I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice</i><br>
My mother will start to worry<br>
<i>Beautiful, what's your hurry?</i><br>
My father will be pacing the floor<br>
<i>Listen to the fireplace roar</i><br>
So really, I'd better scurry<br>
<i>Beautiful, please don't hurry</i><br>
But maybe just a half a drink more<br>
<i>I'll put some records on while I pour</i><br>
The neighbours might think<br>
<i>Baby, it's bad out there</i><br>
Say, what's in this drink?<br>
<i>No cabs to be had out there</i><br>
I wish I knew how<br>
<i>Your eyes are like starlight </i><i>tonight</i><br>
To break this spell<br>
<i>I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell</i><br>
I ought to say, no, no, no sir<br>

At least I'm gonna say that I tried<br>
<i>What's the sense in hurting my pride?</i><br>

I really can't stay<br>
<i>But baby, don't hold out</i><br>
But baby it's cold outside!<br>
I simply must go<br>
<i>But baby, it's cold outside</i><br>
The answer is no, no, no<br>
<i>Aw baby, it's cold outside</i><br>

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor &amp; <i>Brett Eldredge</i>]<br>
Your welcome has been<br>
<i>How lucky that you dropped in</i><br>
So nice and warm<br>
<i>Look out the window at that storm</i><br>
My sister will be suspicious<br>
<i>Um gosh, your lips are delicious</i><br>
And my brother will be there at the door<br>
<i>Waves on a tropical shore</i><br>
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious<br>
<i>Oh gosh, your lips are so delicious</i><br>
But maybe just a cigarette more<br>
<i>Oh never such a blizzard before</i><br>
I've got to get home<br>
<i>But baby, you'll freeze out there</i><br>
Say lend me your coat<br>
<i>Oh up to your knees out there</i><br>
You've really been grand<br>
<i>I thrill when you touch my hand</i><br>
But you don't see, no, no<br>
<i>How can you do this thing to me?</i><br>
There's bound to be talk tomorrow<br>
<i>Think of my life long sorrow</i><br>
At least there will be plenty implied<br>

<br>
Between the Civil War and 1900, steam and electricity replaced human muscle, iron replaced wood, and steel replaced iron (before <a data-id=""2677430"" href=""/2677430/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/The-bessemer-process"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the Bessemer process</a>, iron was hardened into steel at the rate of 3 to 5 tons a day; now the same amount could be processed in 15 minutes). Machines could now drive steel tools. Oil could lubricate machines and light homes, streets, factories. People and goods could move by railroad, propelled by steam along steel rails; by 1900 there were 193,000 miles of railroad. The telephone, the typewriter, and the adding machine speeded up the work of business.<br>
<br>
Machines changed farming. Before the Civil War it took 61 hours of labor to produce an acre of wheat. By 1900, it took 3 hours, 19 minutes. Manufactured ice enabled the transport of food over long distances, and the industry of meatpacking was born.<br>
<br>
Steam drove textile mill spindles; it drove sewing machines. It came from coal. Pneumatic drills now drilled deeper into the earth for coal. In 1860, 14 million tons of coal were mined; by 1884 it was 100 million tons. More coal meant more steel, because coal furnaces converted iron into steel; by 1880 a million tons of steel were being produced; by 1910, 25 million tons. By now electricity was beginning to replace steam. Electrical wire needed copper, of which 30,000 tons were produced in 1880; 500,000 tons by 1910.<br>
<br>
To accomplish all this required ingenious inventors of new processes and new machines, clever organizers and administrators of the new corporations, a country rich with land and minerals, and a huge supply of human beings to do the back-breaking, unhealthful, and dangerous work. Immigrants would come from Europe and China, to make the new labor force. Farmers unable to buy the new machinery or pay the new railroad rates would move to the cities. Between 1860 and 1914, New York grew from 850,000 to 4 million, Chicago from 110,000 to 2 million, Philadelphia from 650,000 to 1 1/2 million.<br>
<br>
In some cases the inventor himself became the organizer of businesses-<a data-id=""2677448"" href=""/2677448/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/Like-thomas-edison"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">like Thomas Edison</a>, inventor of electrical devices. In other cases, the businessman compiled other people's inventions, like Gustavus Swift, a Chicago butcher who put together the ice-cooled railway car with the ice- cooled warehouse to make the first national meatpacking company in 1885. James Duke used a new cigarette-rolling machine that could roll, paste, and cut tubes of tobacco into 100,000 cigarettes a day; in 1890 he combined the four biggest cigarette producers to form the American Tobacco Company.<br>
<br>
While some multimillionaires started in poverty, most did not. A study of the origins of 303 textile, railroad, and steel executives of the 1870s showed that 90 percent came from middle- or upper-class families. The Horatio Alger stories of ""rags to riches"" were true for a few men, but mostly a myth, and a useful myth for control.<br>
<br>
Most of the fortune building was done legally, with the collaboration of the government and the courts. Sometimes the collaboration had to be paid for. Thomas Edison promised New Jersey politicians $1,000 each in return for favorable legislation. Daniel Drew and Jay Gould spent $1 million to bribe the New York legislature to legalize their issue of $8 million in ""watered stock"" (stock not representing real value) on the Erie Railroad.<br>
<br>
The first transcontinental railroad was built with blood, sweat, politics and thievery, out of the meeting of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads. The Central Pacific started on the West Coast going east; it spent $200,000 in Washington on bribes to get 9 million acres of free land and $24 million in bonds, and paid $79 million, an overpayment of $36 million, to a construction company which really was its own. The construction was done by three thousand Irish and <a data-id=""2677472"" href=""/2677472/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/Ten-thousand-chinese"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">ten thousand Chinese</a>, over a period of four years, working for one or two dollars a day.<br>
<br>
The Union Pacific started in Nebraska going west. It had been given 12 million acres of free land and $27 million in government bonds. It created the Credit Mobilier company and gave them $94 million for construction when the actual cost was $44 million. Shares were sold cheaply to Congressmen to prevent investigation. This was at the suggestion of Massachusetts Congressman Oakes Ames, a shovel manufacturer and director of Credit Mobilier, who said: ""There is no difficulty in getting men to look after their own property."" The Union Pacific used twenty thousand workers-war veterans and Irish immigrants, who laid 5 miles of track a day and died by the hundreds in the heat, the cold, and the battles with Indians opposing the invasion of their territory.<br>
<br>
Both railroads used longer, twisting routes to get subsidies from towns they went through. In 1869, amid music and speeches, the two crooked lines met in Utah.<br>
<br>
The wild fraud on the railroads led to more control of railroad finances by bankers, who wanted more stability-profit by law rather than by theft. By the 1890s, most of the country's railway mileage was concentrated in six huge systems. Four of these were completely or partially controlled by the House of Morgan, and two others by the bankers Kuhn, Loeb, and Company.<br>
<br>
J. P. Morgan had started before the war, as the son of a banker who began selling stocks for the railroads for good commissions. During the Civil War he bought five thousand rifles for $3.50 each from an army arsenal, and sold them to a general in the field for $22 each. The rifles were defective and would shoot off the thumbs of the soldiers using them. A congressional committee noted this in the small print of an obscure report, but a federal judge upheld the deal as the fulfillment of a valid legal contract.<br>

<br>
It was the firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company that was given a U.S. government contract to float a bond issue of $260 million. The government could have sold the bonds directly; it chose to pay the bankers $5 million in commission.<br>
<br>
On January 2, 1889, as Gustavus Myers reports:<br>
<br>
... a circular marked ""Private and Confidential"" was issued by the three banking houses of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Company, Brown Brothers &amp; Company, and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company. The most painstaking care was exercised that this document should not find its way into the press or otherwise become public.... Why this fear? Because the circular was an invitation ... to the great railroad magnates to assemble at Morgan's house, No. 219 Madison Avenue, there to form, in the phrase of the day, an iron-clad combination. ... a compact which would efface competition among certain railroads, and unite those interests in an agreement by which the people of the United States would be bled even more effectively than before.<br>
<br>
There was a human cost to this exciting story of financial ingenuity. That year, 1889, records of the Interstate Commerce Commission showed that 22,000 railroad workers were killed or injured.<br>
<br>
In 1895 the gold reserve of the United States was depleted, while twenty-six New York City banks had $129 million in gold in their vaults. A syndicate of bankers headed by J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, August Belmont &amp; Company, the National City Bank, and others offered to give the government gold in exchange for bonds. President Grover Cleveland agreed. The bankers immediately resold the bonds at higher prices, making $18 million profit.<br>
<br>
A journalist wrote: ""If a man wants to buy beef, he must go to the butcher.... If Mr. Cleveland wants much gold, he must go to the big banker.""<br>
<br>
While making his fortune, Morgan brought rationality and organization to the national economy. He kept the system stable. He said: ""We do not want financial convulsions and have one thing one day and another thing another day."" He linked railroads to one another, all of them to banks, banks to insurance companies. By 1900, he controlled 100,000 miles of railroad, half the country's mileage.<br>
<br>
Three insurance companies dominated by the Morgan group had a billion dollars in assets. They had $50 million a year to invest-money given by ordinary people for their insurance policies. Louis Brandeis, describing this in his book Other People's Money (before he became a Supreme Court justice), wrote: ""They control the people through the people's own money.""<br>
<br>
John D. Rockefeller started as a bookkeeper in Cleveland, became a merchant, accumulated money, and decided that, in the new industry of oil, who controlled the oil refineries controlled the industry. He bought his first oil refinery in 1862, and by 1870 set up Standard Oil Company of Ohio, made secret agreements with railroads to ship his oil with them if they gave him rebates- discounts-on their prices, <a data-id=""2677505"" href=""/2677505/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/And-thus-drove-competitors-out-of-business"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">and thus drove competitors out of business.</a><br>
<br>
One independent refiner said: ""If we did not sell out.... we would be crushed out.. .. There was only one buyer on the market and we had to sell at their terms."" Memos like this one passed among Standard Oil officials: ""Wilkerson &amp; Co. received car of oil Monday 13th... . Please turn another screw."" A rival refinery in Buffalo was rocked by a small explosion arranged by Standard Oil officials with the refinery's chief mechanic.<br>
<br>
The Standard Oil Company, by 1899, was a holding company which controlled the stock of many other companies. The capital was $110 million, the profit was $45 million a year, and John D. Rockefeller's fortune was estimated at $200 million. Before long he would move into iron, copper, coal, shipping, and banking (Chase Manhattan Bank). Profits would be $81 million a year, and the Rockefeller fortune would total two billion dollars.<br>
<br>
Andrew Carnegie was a telegraph clerk at seventeen, then secretary to the head of the Pennsylvania Railroad, then broker in Wall Street selling railroad bonds for huge commissions, and was soon a millionaire. He went to London in 1872, saw the new Bessemer method of producing steel, and returned to the United States to build a million-dollar steel plant. Foreign competition was kept out by a high tariff conveniently set by Congress, and by 1880 Carnegie was producing 10,000 tons of steel a month, making $1 1/2 million a year in profit. By 1900 he was making $40 million a year, and that year, at a dinner party, he agreed to sell his steel company to J. P. Morgan. He scribbled the price on a note: <a data-id=""3886505"" href=""/3886505/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/492000000"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">$492,000,000.</a><br>
<br>
Morgan then formed the U.S. Steel Corporation, combining Carnegie's corporation with others. He sold stocks and bonds for $1,300,000,000 (about 400 million more than the combined worth of the companies) and took a fee of 150 million for arranging the consolidation. How could dividends be paid to all those stockholders and bondholders? By making sure Congress passed tariffs keeping out foreign steel; by closing off competition and maintaining the price at $28 a ton; and by working 200,000 men twelve hours a day for wages that barely kept their families alive.<br>
<br>
And so it went, in industry after industry-shrewd, efficient businessmen building empires, choking out competition, maintaining high prices, keeping wages low, using government subsidies. These industries were the first beneficiaries of the ""welfare state."" By the turn of the century, American Telephone and telegraph had a monopoly of the nation's telephone system, International Harvester made 85 percent of all farm machinery, and in every other industry resources became concentrated, controlled. The banks had interests in so many of these monopolies as to create an interlocking network of powerful corporation directors, each of whom sat on the boards of many other corporations. <a data-id=""2677542"" href=""/2677542/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/According-to-a-senate-report-of-the-early-twentieth-century-morgan-at-his-peak-sat-on-the-board-of-forty-eight-corporations-rockefeller-thirty-seven-corporations"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">According to a Senate report of the early twentieth century, Morgan at his peak sat on the board of forty-eight corporations; Rockefeller, thirty-seven corporations.</a><br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the government of the United States was behaving almost exactly as Karl Marx described a capitalist state: pretending neutrality to maintain order, but serving the interests of the rich. Not that the rich agreed among themselves; they had disputes over policies. But the purpose of the state was to settle upper-class disputes peacefully, control lower-class rebellion, and adopt policies that would further the long-range stability of the system. The arrangement between Democrats and Republicans to elect Rutherford Hayes in 1877 set the tone. Whether Democrats or Republicans won, national policy would not change in any important way.<br>
<br>
When Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, ran for President in 1884, the general impression in the country was that he opposed the power of monopolies and corporations, and that the Republican party, whose candidate was James Blaine, stood for the wealthy. But when Cleveland defeated Blaine, Jay Gould wired him: ""I feel ... that the vast business interests of the country will be entirely safe in your hands."" And he was right.<br>
<br>
One of Cleveland's chief advisers was William Whitney, a millionaire and corporation lawyer, who married into the Standard Oil fortune and was appointed Secretary of the Navy by Cleveland. He immediately set about to create a ""steel navy,"" buying the steel at artificially high prices from Carnegie's plants. Cleveland himself assured industrialists that his election should not frighten them: ""No harm shall come to any business interest as the result of administrative policy so long as I am President ... a transfer of executive control from one party to another does not mean any serious disturbance of existing conditions.""<br>
<br>
The presidential election itself had avoided real issues; there was no clear understanding of which interests would gain and which would lose if certain policies were adopted. It took the usual form of election campaigns, concealing the basic similarity of the parties by dwelling on personalities, gossip, trivialities. Henry Adams, an astute literary commentator on that era, wrote to a friend about the election:<br>
<br>
We are here plunged in politics funnier than words can express. Very great issues are involved.. . . But the amusing thing is that no one talks about real interests. By common consent they agree to let these alone. We are afraid to discuss them. Instead of this the press is engaged in a most amusing dispute whether Mr. Cleveland had an illegitimate child and did or did not live with more than one mistress.<br>
<br>
In 1887, with a huge surplus in the treasury, Cleveland vetoed a bill appropriating $100,000 to give relief to Texas farmers to help them buy seed grain during a drought. He said: ""Federal aid in such cases .. . encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character."" But that same year, Cleveland used his gold surplus to pay off wealthy bondholders at $28 above the $100 value of each bond-a gift of $45 million.<br>
<br>
The chief reform of the Cleveland administration gives away the secret of reform legislation in America. The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was supposed to regulate the railroads on behalf of the consumers. But Richard Olney, a lawyer for the Boston &amp; Maine and other railroads, and soon to be Cleveland's Attorney General, told railroad officials who complained about the Interstate Commerce Commission that it would not be wise to abolish the Commission ""from a railroad point of view."" He explained:<br>
<br>
The Commission ... is or can be made, of great use to the railroads. It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of railroads, at the same time that that supervision is almost entirely nominal. . . . The part of wisdom is not to destroy the Commission, but to utilize it.<br>
<br>
Cleveland himself, in his 1887 State of the Union message, had made a similar point, adding a warning: ""Opportunity for safe, careful, and deliberate reform is now offered; and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people . . . may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs.""<br>
<br>
Republican Benjamin Harrison, who succeeded Cleveland as President from 1889 to 1893, was described by Matthew Josephson, in his colorful study of the post-Civil War years, The Politicos: ""Benjamin Harrison had the exclusive distinction of having served the railway corporations in the dual capacity of lawyer and soldier. He prosecuted the strikers [of 1877] in the federal courts . .. and he also organized and commanded a company of soldiers during the strike. ...""<br>
<br>
Harrison's term also saw a gesture toward reform. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act, passed in 1890, called itself ""An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints"" and made it illegal to form a ""combination or conspiracy"" to restrain trade in interstate or foreign commerce. Senator John Sherman, author of the Act, explained the need to conciliate the critics of monopoly: ""They had monopolies ... of old, but never before such giants as in our day. You must heed their appeal or be ready for the socialist, the communist, the nihilist. Society is now disturbed by forces never felt before. . . .""<br>
<br>
When Cleveland was elected President again in 1892, Andrew Carnegie, in Europe, received a letter from the manager of his steel plants, Henry Clay Frick: ""I am very sorry for President Harrison, but I cannot see that our interests are going to be affected one way or the other by the change in administration."" Cleveland, facing the agitation in the country caused by the panic and depression of 1893, used troops to break up ""Coxey's Army,"" a demonstration of unemployed men who had come to Washington, and again to break up the national strike on the railroads the following year.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, despite its look of somber, black-robed fairness, was doing its bit for the ruling elite. How could it be independent, with its members chosen by the President and ratified by the Senate? How could it be neutral between rich and poor when its members were often former wealthy lawyers, and almost always came from the upper class? Early in the nineteenth century the Court laid the legal basis for a nationally regulated economy by establishing federal control over interstate commerce, and the legal basis for corporate capitalism by making the contract sacred.<br>
<br>
In 1895 the Court interpreted the Sherman Act so as to make it harmless. It said a monopoly of sugar refining was a monopoly in manufacturing, not commerce, and so could not be regulated by Congress through the Sherman Act (U.S. v. E. C. Knight Co.). The Court also said the Sherman Act could be used against interstate strikes (the railway strike of 1894) because they were in restraint of trade. It also declared unconstitutional a small attempt by Congress to tax high incomes at a higher rate (Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company). In later years it would refuse to break up the Standard Oil and American Tobacco monopolies, saying the Sherman Act barred only ""unreasonable"" combinations in restraint of trade.<br>
<br>
A New York banker toasted the Supreme Court in 1895: ""I give you, gentlemen, the Supreme Court of the United States-guardian of the dollar, defender of private property, enemy of spoliation, sheet anchor of the Republic.""<br>
<br>
Very soon after the Fourteenth Amendment became law, the Supreme Court began to demolish it as a protection for blacks, and to develop it as a protection for corporations. However, in 1877, a Supreme Court decision (Munn v. Illinois) approved state laws regulating the prices charged to farmers for the use of grain elevators. The grain elevator company argued it was a person being deprived of property, thus violating the Fourteenth Amendment's declaration ""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."" The Supreme Court disagreed, saying that grain elevators were not simply private property but were invested with ""a public interest"" and so could be regulated.<br>
<br>
One year after that decision, the American Bar Association, organized by lawyers accustomed to serving the wealthy, began a national campaign of education to reverse the Court decision. Its presidents said, at different times: ""If trusts are a defensive weapon of property interests against the communistic trend, they are desirable."" And: ""Monopoly is often a necessity and an advantage.""<br>
<br>
By 1886, they succeeded. State legislatures, under the pressure of aroused farmers, had passed laws to regulate the rates charged farmers by the railroads. The Supreme Court that year (Wabash v. Illinois) said states could not do this, that this was an intrusion on federal power. That year alone, the Court did away with 230 state laws that had been passed to regulate corporations.<br>
<br>
By this time the Supreme Court had accepted the argument that corporations were ""persons"" and their money was property protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Supposedly, the Amendment had been passed to protect Negro rights, but of the Fourteenth Amendment cases brought before the Supreme Court between 1890 and 1910, nineteen dealt with the Negro, 288 dealt with corporations.<br>
<br>
The justices of the Supreme Court were not simply interpreters of the Constitution. They were men of certain backgrounds, of certain interests. One of them (Justice Samuel Miller) had said in 1875: ""It is vain to contend with Judges who have been at the bar the advocates for forty years of railroad companies, and all forms of associated capital. . . ."" In 1893, Supreme Court Justice David J. Brewer, addressing the New York State Bar Association, said:<br>
<br>
It is the unvarying law that the wealth of the community will be in the hands of the few. . . . The great majority of men are unwilling to endure that long self-denial and saving which makes accumulations possible . .. and hence it always has been, and until human nature is remodeled always will be true, that the wealth of a nation is in the hands of a few, while the many subsist upon the proceeds of their daily toil.<br>
<br>
This was not just a whim of the 1880s and 1890s-it went back to the Founding Fathers, who had learned their law in the era of Blackstone's Commentaries, which said: ""So great is the regard of the law for private property, that it will not authorize the least violation of it; no, not even for the common good of the whole community.""<br>
<br>
Control in modern times requires more than force, more than law. It requires that a population dangerously concentrated in cities and factories, whose lives are filled with cause for rebellion, be taught that all is right as it is. And so, the schools, the churches, the popular literature taught that to be rich was a sign of superiority, to be poor a sign of personal failure, and that the only way upward for a poor person was to climb into the ranks of the rich by extraordinary effort and extraordinary luck.<br>
<br>
In those years after the Civil War, a man named Russell Conwell, a graduate of Yale Law School, a minister, and author of best-selling books, gave the same lecture, ""Acres of Diamonds,"" more than five thousand times to audiences across the country, reaching several million people in all. His message was that anyone could get rich if he tried hard enough, that everywhere, if people looked closely enough, were ""acres of diamonds."" A sampling:<br>

Conwell was a founder of Temple University. Rockefeller was a donor to colleges all over the country and helped found the University of Chicago. Huntington, of the Central Pacific, gave money to two Negro colleges, Hampton Institute and Tuskegee Institute. Carnegie gave money to colleges and to libraries. Johns Hopkins was founded by a millionaire merchant, and millionaires Cornelius Vanderbilt, Ezra Cornell, James Duke, and Leland Stanford created universities in their own names.<br>
<br>
The rich, giving part of their enormous earnings in this way, became known as philanthropists. These educational institutions did not encourage dissent; they trained the middlemen in the American system-the teachers, doctors, lawyers, administrators, engineers, technicians, politicians- those who would be paid to keep the system going, to be loyal buffers against trouble.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the spread of public school education enabled the learning of writing, reading, and arithmetic for a whole generation of workers, skilled and semiskilled, who would be the literate or force of the new industrial age. It was important that these people learn obedience to authority. A journalist observer of the schools in the 1890s wrote: ""The unkindly spirit of the teacher is strikingly apparent; the pupils, being completely subjugated to her will, are silent and motionless, the spiritual atmosphere of the classroom is damp and chilly.""<br>
<br>
Back in 1859, the desire of mill owners in the town of Lowell that their workers be educated was explained by the secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education:<br>
<br>
The owners of factories are more concerned than other classes and interests in the intelligence of their laborers. When the latter are well-educated and the former are disposed to deal justly, controversies and strikes can never occur, nor can the minds of the masses be prejudiced by demagogues and controlled by temporary and factious considerations.<br>
<br>
Joel Spring, in his book Education and the Rise of the Corporate State, says: ""The development of a factory-like system in the nineteenth-century schoolroom was not accidental.""<br>
<br>
This continued into the twentieth century, when William Bagley's Classroom Management became a standard teacher training text, reprinted thirty times. Bagley said: ""One who studies educational theory aright can see in the mechanical routine of the classroom the educative forces that are slowly transforming the child from a little savage into a creature of law and order, fit for the life of civilized society.""<br>
<br>
It was in the middle and late nineteenth century that high schools developed as aids to the industrial system, that history was widely required in the curriculum to foster patriotism. Loyalty oaths, teacher certification, and the requirement of citizenship were introduced to control both the educational and the political quality of teachers. Also, in the latter part of the century, school officials-not teachers-were given control over textbooks. Laws passed by the states barred certain kinds of textbooks. Idaho and Montana, for instance, forbade textbooks propagating ""political"" doctrines, and the Dakota territory ruled that school libraries could not have ""partisan political pamphlets or books.""<br>
<br>
Against this gigantic organization of knowledge and education for orthodoxy and obedience, there arose a literature of dissent and protest, which had to make its way from reader to reader against great obstacles. Henry George, a self-educated workingman from a poor Philadelphia family, who became a newspaperman and an economist, wrote a book that was published in 1879 and sold millions of copies, not only in the United States, but all over the world. His book Progress and Poverty argued that the basis of wealth was land, that this was becoming monopolized, and that a single tax on land, abolishing all others, would bring enough revenue to solve the problem of poverty and equalize wealth in the nation. Readers may not have been persuaded of his solutions, but they could see in their own lives the accuracy of his observations:<br>
<br>
It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the average of comfort, leisure and refinement has been raised; but these gains are not general. In them the lowest class do not share... This association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times. ... There is a vague but general feeling of disappointment; an increased bitterness among the working classes; a widespread feeling of unrest and brooding revolution.. . . The civilized world is trembling on the verge of a great movement. Either it must be a leap upward, which will open the way to advances yet undreamed of, or it must he a plunge downward which will carry us back toward barbarism. ...<br>
<br>
A different kind of challenge to the economic and social system was given by Edward Bellamy, a lawyer and writer from western Massachusetts, who wrote, in simple, intriguing language, a novel called Looking Backward, in which the author fells asleep and wakes up in the year 2000, to find a socialistic society in which people work and live cooperatively. Looking Backward, which described socialism vividly, lovingly, sold a million copies in a few years, and over a hundred groups were organized around the country to try to make the dream come true.<br>
<br>
It seemed that despite the strenuous efforts of government, business, the church, the schools, to control their thinking, millions of Americans were ready to consider harsh criticism of the existing system, to contemplate other possible ways of living. They were helped in this by the great movements of workers and farmers that swept the country in the 1880s and 1890s. These movements went beyond the scattered strikes and tenants' struggles of the period 1830-1877. They were nationwide movements, more threatening than before to the ruling elite, more dangerously suggestive. It was a time when revolutionary organizations existed in major American cities, and revolutionary talk was in the air.<br>
<br>
In the 1880s and 1890s, immigrants were pouring in from Europe at a faster rate than before. They all went through the harrowing ocean voyage of the poor. Now there were not so many Irish and German immigrants as Italians, Russians, Jews, Greeks-people from Southern and Eastern Europe, even more alien to native-born Anglo-Saxons than the earlier newcomers.<br>
<br>
How the immigration of different ethnic groups contributed to the fragmentation of the working class, how conflicts developed among groups facing the same difficult conditions, is shown in an article in a Bohemian newspaper, Svornost, of February 27, 1880. A petition of 258 parents and guardians at the Throop School in New York, signed by over half the taxpayers of the school district, said ""the petitioners have just as much right to request the teaching of Bohemian as have the German citizens to have German taught in the public schools.... In opposition to this, Mr. Vocke claims that there is a great deal of difference between Germans and Bohemians, or in other words, they are superior.""<br>
<br>
The Irish, still recalling the hatred against them when they arrived, began to get jobs with the new political machines that wanted their vote. Those who became policemen encountered the new Jewish immigrants. On July 30, 1902, New York's Jewish community held a mass funeral for an important rabbi, and a riot took place, led by Irish who resented Jews coming into their neighborhood. The police force was dominantly Irish, and the official investigation of the riot indicated the police helped the rioters: "". .. it appears that charges of unprovoked and most brutal clubbing have been made against policemen, with the result that they were reprimanded or fined a day's pay and were yet retained upon the force.""<br>
<br>
There was desperate economic competition among the newcomers. By 1880, Chinese immigrants, brought in by the railroads to do the backbreaking labor at pitiful wages, numbered 75,000 in California, almost one-tenth of the population. They became the objects of continuous violence. The novelist Bret Harte wrote an obituary for a Chinese man named Wan Lee:<br>
<br>
Dead, my revered friends, dead. Stoned to death in the streets of San Francisco, in the year of grace 1869 by a mob of halfgrown boys and Christian school children.<br>
<br>
In Rock Springs, Wyoming, in the summer of 1885, whites attacked five hundred Chinese miners, massacring twenty-eight of them in cold blood.<br>
<br>
<a href=""/7733460/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/The-new-immigrants-became-laborers-housepainters-stonecutters-ditchdiggers-they-were-often-imported-en-masse-by-contractors"" data-id=""7733460"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">The new immigrants became laborers, housepainters, stonecutters, ditchdiggers. They were often imported en masse by contractors.</a> One Italian man, told he was going to Connecticut to work on the railroad, was taken instead to sulfate mines in the South, where he and his fellows were watched over by armed guards in their barracks and in the mines, given only enough money to pay for their railroad fare and tools, and very little to eat. He and others decided to escape. They were captured at gunpoint, ordered to work or die; they still refused and were brought before a judge, put in manacles, and, five months after their arrival, finally dismissed. ""My comrades took the train for New York. I had only one dollar, and with this, not knowing either the country or the language, I had to walk to New York. After forty-two days I arrived in the city utterly exhausted.""<br>
<br>
Their conditions led sometimes to rebellion. A contemporary observer told how ""some Italians who worked in a locality near Deal Lake, New Jersey, failing to receive their wages, captured the contractor and shut him up in the shanty, where he remained a prisoner until the county sheriff came with a posse to his rescue.""<br>
<br>
A traffic in immigrant child laborers developed, either by contract with desperate parents in the home country or by kidnapping. The children were then supervised by ""padrones"" in a form of slavery, sometimes sent out as beggar musicians. Droves of them roamed the streets of New York and Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
As the immigrants became naturalized citizens, they were brought into the American two-party system, invited to be loyal to one party or the other, their political energy thus siphoned into elections. An article in L'ltalia, in November 1894, called for Italians to support the Republican party:<br>
<br>
When American citizens of foreign birth refuse to ally themselves with the Republican Party, they make war upon their own welfare. The Republican Party stands for all that the people fight for in the Old World. It is the champion of freedom, progress, order, and law. It is the steadfast foe of monarchial class role.<br>
<br>
There were 5 1/2 million immigrants in the 1880s, 4 million in the 1890s, creating a labor surplus that kept wages down. The immigrants were more controllable, more helpless than native workers; they were culturally displaced, at odds with one another, therefore useful as strikebreakers. Often their children worked, intensifying the problem of an oversized labor force and joblessness; in 1880 there were 1,118,000 children under sixteen (one out of six) at work in the United States. With everyone working long hours, families often became strangers to one another. A pants presser named Morris Rosenfeld wrote a poem, ""My Boy,"" which became widely reprinted and recited:<br>
<br>
I have a little boy at home,<br>
A pretty little son;<br>
I think sometimes the world is mine<br>
In him, my only one. . . .<br>
<br>
'Ere dawn my labor drives me forth;<br>
Tis night when I am free;<br>
A stranger am I to my child;<br>
And stranger my child to me. ...<br>
<br>
Women immigrants became servants, prostitutes, housewives, factory workers, and sometimes rebels. Leonora Barry was born in Ireland and brought to the United States. She got married, and when her husband died she went to work in a hosiery mill in upstate New York to support three young children, earning 65 cents her first week. She joined the Knights of Labor, which had fifty thousand women members in 192 women's assemblies by 1886. She became ""master workman"" of her assembly of 927 women, and was appointed to work for the Knights as a general investigator, to ""go forth and educate her sister working-women and the public generally as to their needs and necessities."" She described the biggest problem of women workers: ""Through long years of endurance they have acquired, as a sort of second nature, the habit of submission and acceptance without question of any terms offered them, with the pessimistic view of life in which they see no hope."" Her report for the year 1888 showed: 537 requests to help women organize, 100 cities and towns visited, 1,900 leaflets distributed.<br>
<br>
In 1884, women's assemblies of textile workers and hatmakers went on strike. The following year in New York, cloak and shirt makers, men and women (holding separate meetings but acting together), went on strike. The New York World called it ""a revolt for bread and butter."" They won higher wages and shorter hours.<br>
<br>
That winter in Yonkers, a few women carpet weavers were fired for joining the Knights, and in the cold of February, 2,500 women walked out and picketed the mill. Only seven hundred of them were members of the Knights, but all the strikers soon joined. The police attacked the picket line and arrested them, but a jury found them not guilty. A great dinner was held by working people in New York to honor them, with two thousand delegates from unions all over the city. The strike lasted six months, and the women won some of their demands, getting back their jobs, but without recognition of their union.<br>
<br>
What was astonishing in so many of these struggles was not that the strikers did not win all that they wanted, but that, against such great odds, they dared to resist, and were not destroyed.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was the recognition that day-to-day combat was not enough, that fundamental change was needed, which stimulated the growth of revolutionary movements at this time. The Socialist Labor party, formed in 1877, was tiny, and torn by internal arguments, but it had some influence in organizing unions among foreign workers. In New York, Jewish socialists organized and put out a newspaper. In Chicago, German revolutionaries, along with native-born radicals like Albert Parsons, formed Social Revolutionary clubs. In 1883, an anarchist congress took place in Pittsburgh. It drew up a manifesto:<br>
<br>
... All laws are directed against the working people. . .. Even the school serves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring of the wealthy with those qualities necessary to uphold their class domination. The children of the poor get scarcely a formal elementary training, and this, too, is mainly directed to such branches as tend to producing prejudices, arrogance, and servility; in short, want of sense. The Church finally seeks to make complete idiots out of the mass and to make them forego the paradise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven. The capitalist press, on the other hand, takes care of the confusion of spirits in public life. . .. The workers can therefore expect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggle against the existing system. They must achieve their liberation by their own efforts. As in former times, a privileged class never surrenders its tyranny, neither can it be expected that the capitalists of this age will give up their rulership without being forced to do it. ...<br>
<br>
The manifesto asked ""equal rights for all without distinction to sex or race."" It quoted the Communist Manifesto: ""Workmen of all lands, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains; you have a world to win!""<br>
<br>
In Chicago, the new International Working People's Association had five thousand members, published newspapers in five languages, organized mass demonstrations and parades, and through its leadership in strikes was a powerful influence in the twenty-two unions that made up the Central Labor Union of Chicago. There were differences in theory among all these revolutionary groups, but the theorists were often brought together by the practical needs of labor struggles, and there were many in the mid-1880s.<br>
<br>
In early 1886, the Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad fired a leader of the district assembly of the Knights of Labor, and this led to a strike which spread throughout the Southwest, tying up traffic as far as St. Louis and Kansas City. Nine young men recruited in New Orleans as marshals, brought to Texas to protect company property, learned about the strike and quit their jobs, saying, ""as man to man we could not justifiably go to work and take the bread out of our fellow-workmen's mouths, no matter how much we needed it ourselves."" They were then arrested for defrauding the company by refusing to work, and sentenced to three months in the Galveston county jail.<br>
<br>
The strikers engaged in sabotage. A news dispatch from Atchison, Kansas:<br>
<br>
At 12:45 this morning the men on guard at the Missouri Pacific roundhouse were surprised by the appearance of 35 or 40 masked men. The guards were corralled in the oil room by a detachment of the visitors who stood guard with pistols .. . while the rest of them thoroughly disabled 12 locomotives which stood in the stalls.<br>
<br>
In April, in East St. Louis, there was a battle between strikers and police. Seven workingmen were killed, whereupon workers burned the freight depot of the Louisville &amp; Nashville. The governor declared martial law and sent in seven hundred National Guardsmen. With mass arrests, violent attacks by sheriffs and deputies, no support from the skilled, paid-paid workers of the Railway Brotherhoods, the strikers could not hold out. After several months they surrendered, and many of them were blacklisted.<br>
<br>
By the spring of 1886, the movement for an eight-hour day had grown. On May 1, the American Federation of Labor, now five years old, called for nationwide strikes wherever the eight-hour day was refused. Terence Powderly, head of the Knights of Labor, opposed the strike, saying that employers and employees must first be educated on the eight-hour day, but assemblies of the Knights made plans to strike. The grand chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers opposed the eight-hour day, saying ""two hours less work means two hours more loafing about the corners and two hours more for drink,"" but railroad workers did not agree and supported the eight- hour movement.<br>
<br>
So, 350,000 workers in 11,562 establishments all over the country went out on strike. In Detroit, 11,000 workers marched in an eight-hour parade. In New York, 25,000 formed a torchlight procession along Broadway, headed by 3,400 members of the Bakers' Union. In Chicago, 40,000 struck, and 45,000 were granted a shorter working day to prevent them from striking. Every railroad in Chicago stopped running, and most of the industries in Chicago were paralyzed. The stockyards were closed down.<br>
<br>
A ""Citizens' Committee"" of businessmen met daily to map strategy in Chicago. The state militia had been called out, the police were ready, and the Chicago Mail on May 1 asked that Albert Parsons and August Spies, the anarchist leaders of the International Working People's Association, be watched. ""Keep them in view. Hold them personally responsible for any trouble that occurs. Make an example of them if trouble occurs.""<br>
<br>
Under the leadership of Parsons and Spies, the Central Labor Union, with twenty-two unions, had adopted a fiery resolution in the fall of 1885:<br>
<br>
Be it Resolved, That we urgently call upon the wage-earning class to arm itself in order to be able to put forth against their exploiters such an argument which alone can be effective: Violence, and further be it Resolved, that notwithstanding that we expect very little from the introduction of the eight-hour day, we firmly promise to assist our more backward brethren in this class struggle with all means and power at our disposal, so long as they will continue to show an open and resolute front to our common oppressors, the aristocratic vagabonds and exploiters. Our war-cry is ""Death to the foes of the human race.""<br>
<br>
On May 3, a series of events took place which were to put Parsons and Spies in exactly the position that the Chicago Mail had suggested (""Make an example of them if trouble occurs""). That day, in front of the McCormick Harvester Works, where strikers and sympathizers fought scabs, the police fired into a crowd of strikers running from the scene, wounded many of them, and killed four. Spies, enraged, went to the printing shop of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and printed a circular in both English and German:<br>
<br>
Revenge!<br>
<br>
Workingmen, to Arms!!!<br>
<br>
. . . You have for years endured the most abject humiliations; . . . you have worked yourself to death... your Children you have sacrificed to the factory lord-in short: you have been miserable and obedient slaves all these years: Why? To satisfy the insatiable greed, to fill the coffers of your thieving master? When you ask them now to lessen your burdens, he sends his bloodhounds out to shoot you, kill you!<br>
<br>
... To arms we call you, to arms!<br>
<br>
A meeting was called for Haymarket Square on the evening of May 4, and about three thousand persons assembled. It was a quiet meeting, and as storm clouds gathered and the hour grew late, the crowd dwindled to a few hundred. A detachment of 180 policemen showed up, advanced on the speakers' platform, ordered the crowd to disperse. The speaker said the meeting was almost over. A bomb then exploded in the midst of the police, wounding sixty-six policemen, of whom seven later died. The police fired into the crowd, killing several people, wounding two hundred.<br>
<br>
With no evidence on who threw the bomb, the police arrested eight anarchist leaders in Chicago. The Chicago Journal said: ""Justice should be prompt in dealing with the arrested anarchists. The law regarding accessories to crime in this State is so plain that their trials will be short."" Illinois law said that anyone inciting a murder was guilty of that murder. The evidence against the eight anarchists was their ideas, their literature; none had been at Haymarket that day except Fielden, who was speaking when the bomb exploded. A jury found them guilty, and they were sentenced to death. Their appeals were denied; the Supreme Court said it had no jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
The event aroused international excitement. Meetings took place in France, Holland, Russia, Italy, Spain. In London a meeting of protest was sponsored by George Bernard Shaw, William Morris, and Peter Kropotkin, among others. Shaw had responded in his characteristic way to the turning down of an appeal by the eight members of the Illinois Supreme Court: ""If the world must lose eight of its people, it can better afford to lose the eight members of the Illinois Supreme Court.""<br>
<br>
A year after the trial, four of the convicted anarchists-Albert Parsons, a printer, August Spies, an upholsterer, Adolph Eischer, and George Engel-were hanged. Louis Lingg, a twenty-one-year-old carpenter, blew himself up in his cell by exploding a dynamite tube in his mouth. Three remained in prison.<br>
<br>
The executions aroused people all over the country. There was a funeral march of 25,000 in Chicago. Some evidence came out that a man named Rudolph Schnaubelt, supposedly an anarchist, was actually an agent of the police, an agent provocateur, hired to throw the bomb and thus enable the arrest of hundreds, the destruction of the revolutionary leadership in Chicago. But to this day it has not been discovered who threw the bomb.<br>
<br>
While the immediate result was a suppression of the radical movement, the long-term effect was to keep alive the class anger of many, to inspire others-especially young people of that generation-to action in revolutionary causes. Sixty thousand signed petitions to the new governor of Illinois, John Peter Altgeld, who investigated the facts, denounced what had happened, and pardoned the three remaining prisoners. Year after year, all over the country, memorial meetings for the Haymarket martyrs were held; it is impossible to know the number of individuals whose political awakening-as with Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, long-time revolutionary stalwarts of the next generation-came from the Haymarket Affair.<br>
<br>
(As late as 1968, the Haymarket events were alive; in that year a group of young radicals in Chicago blew up the monument that had been erected to the memory of the police who died in the explosion. And the trial of eight leaders of the antiwar movement in Chicago around that time evoked, in the press, in meetings, and in literature, the memory of the first ""Chicago Eight,"" on trial for their ideas.)<br>
<br>
After Haymarket, class conflict and violence continued, with strikes, lockouts, blacklisting, the use of Pinkerton detectives and police to break strikes with force, and courts to break them by law. During a strike of streetcar conductors on the Third Avenue Line in New York a month after the Haymarket Affair, police charged a crowd of thousands, using their clubs indiscriminately: ""The New York Sun reported: ""Men with broken scalps were crawling off in all directions....""<br>
<br>
Some of the energy of resentment in late 1886 was poured into the electoral campaign for mayor of New York that fall. Trade unions formed an Independent Labor party and nominated for mayor Henry George, the radical economist, whose Progress and Poverty had been read by tens of thousands of workers. George's platform tells something about the conditions of life for workers in New York in the 1880s. It demanded:<br>
<br>
That property qualifications be abolished for members of juries.<br>
That Grand Jurors be chosen from the lower-class as well as from the upperclass, which dominated Grand Juries.<br>
That the police not interfere with peaceful meetings.<br>
That the sanitary inspection of buildings be enforced.<br>
That contract labor be abolished in public works.<br>
That there be equal pay for equal work for women.<br>
That the streetcars be owned by the municipal government.<br>
<br>
The Democrats nominated an iron manufacturer, Abram Hewitt, and the Republicans nominated Theodore Roosevelt, at a convention presided over by Elihu Root, a corporation lawyer, with the nominating speech given by Chauncey Depew, a railroad director. In a campaign of coercion and bribery, Hewitt was elected with 41 percent of the vote, George came second with 31 percent of the vote, and Roosevelt third with 2 7 percent of the vote. The New York World saw this as a signal:<br>
<br>
The deep-voiced protest conveyed in the 67,000 votes for Henry George against the combined power of both political parties, of Wall Street and the business interests, and of the public press should be a warning to the community to heed the demands of Labor so far as they are just and reasonable. . ..<br>
<br>
In other cities in the country too, labor candidates ran, polling 25,000 out of 92,000 votes in Chicago, electing a mayor in Milwaukee, and various local officials in Fort Worth, Texas, Eaton, Ohio, and Leadville, Colorado.<br>
<br>
It seemed that the weight of Haymarket had not crushed the labor movement. The year 1886 became known to contemporaries as ""the year of the great uprising of labor."" From 1881 to 1885, strikes had averaged about 500 each year, involving perhaps 150,000 workers each year. In 1886 there were over 1,400 strikes, involving 500,000 workers. John Commons, in his History of the Labor Movement in the United States, saw in that:<br>
<br>
... the signs of a great movement by the class of the unskilled, which had finally risen in rebellion.. . . The movement bore in every way the aspect of a social war. A frenzied hatred of labour for capital was shown in every important strike.. .. Extreme bitterness toward capital manifested itself in all the actions of the Knights of Labor, and wherever the leaders undertook to hold it within bounds, they were generally discarded by their followers. . ..<br>
<br>
Even among southern blacks, where all the military, political, and economic force of the southern states, with the acquiescence of the national government, was concentrated on keeping them docile and working, there were sporadic rebellions. In the cotton fields, blacks were dispersed in their work, but in the sugar fields, work was done in gangs, so there was opportunity for organized action. In 1880, they had struck to get a dollar a day instead of 75 cents, threatening to leave the state. Strikers were arrested and jailed, but they walked the roads along the sugar fields, carrying banners: ""A DOLLAR A DAY OR KANSAS."" They were arrested again and again for trespassing, and the strike was broken.<br>
<br>
By 1886, however, the Knights of Labor was organizing in the sugar fields, in the peak year of the Knights' influence. The black workers, unable to feed and clothe their families on their wages, often paid in store scrip, asked a dollar a day once more. The following year, in the fall, close to ten thousand sugar laborers went on strike, 90 percent of them Negroes and members of the Knights. The militia arrived and gun battles began.<br>
<br>
Violence erupted in the town of Thibodaux, which had become a kind of refugee village where hundreds of strikers, evicted from their plantation shacks, gathered, penniless and ragged, carrying their bed clothing and babies. Their refusal to work threatened the entire sugar crop, and martial law was declared in Thibodaux. Henry and George Cox, two Negro brothers, leaders in the Knights of Labor, were arrested, locked up, then taken from their cells, and never heard from again. On the night of November 22, shooting broke out, each side claiming the other was at fault; by noon the next day, thirty Negroes were dead or dying, and hundreds wounded. Two whites were wounded. A Negro newspaper in New Orleans wrote:<br>
<br>
. . . Lame men and blind women shot; children and hoary-headed grandsires ruthlessly swept down! The Negroes offered no resistance; they could not, as the killing was unexpected. Those of them not killed took to the woods, a majority of them finding refuge in this city.. . .<br>
<br>
Citizens of the United States killed by a mob directed by a State judge. .. . Laboring men seeking an advance in wages, treated as if they were dogs! . ..<br>
<br>
At such times and upon such occasions, words of condemnation fall like snow-flakes upon molten lead. The blacks should defend their lives, and if needs must die, die with their faces toward their persecutors fighting for their homes, their children and their lawful rights.<br>
<br>
Native-born poor whites were not doing well either. In the South, they were tenant farmers rather than landowners. In the southern cities, they were tenants, not homeowners. C. Vann Woodward notes (Origins of the New South) that the city with the highest rate of tenancy in the United States was Birmingham, with 90 percent. And the slums of the southern cities were among the worst, poor whites living like the blacks, on unpaved dirt streets ""choked up with garbage, filth and mud,"" according to a report of one state board of health.<br>
<br>
There were eruptions against the convict labor system in the South, in which prisoners were leased in slave labor to corporations, used thus to depress the general level of wages and also to break strikes. In the year 1891, miners of the Tennessee Coal Mine Company were asked to sign an ""iron- clad contract"": pledging no strikes, agreeing to get paid in scrip, and giving up the right to check the weight of the coal they mined (they were paid by the weight). They refused to sign and were evicted from their houses. Convicts were brought in to replace them.<br>
<br>
On the night of October 31, 1891, a thousand armed miners took control of the mine area, set five hundred convicts free, and burned down the stockades in which the convicts were kept. The companies surrendered, agreeing not to use convicts, not to require the ""ironclad contract/' and to let the miners check on the weight of the coal they mined.<br>
<br>
The following year, there were more such incidents in Tennessee. C. Vann Woodward calls them ""insurrections."" Miners overpowered guards of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company, burned the stockades, shipped the convicts to Nashville. Other unions in Tennessee came to their aid. An observer reported back to the Chattanooga Federation of Trades:<br>
<br>
I should like to impress upon people the extent of this movement. I have seen the written assurance of reinforcements to the miners of fully 7500 men, who will be on the field in ten hours after the first shot is fired. . .. The entire district is as one over the main proposition, ""the convicts must go"". I counted 840 rifles on Monday as the miners passed, while the vast multitude following them carried revolvers. The captains of the different companies are all Grand Army men. Whites and Negroes are standing shoulder to shoulder.<br>
<br>
That same year, in New Orleans, forty-two union locals, with over twenty thousand members, mostly white but including some blacks (there was one black on the strike committee), called a general strike, involving half the population of the city. Work in New Orleans came to a stop. After three days-with strikebreakers brought in, martial law, and the threat of militia-the strike ended with a compromise, gaining hours and wages but without recognition of the unions as bargaining agents.<br>
<br>
The year 1892 saw strike struggles all over the country: besides the general strike in New Orleans and the coal miners' strike in Tennessee, there was a railroad switchmen's strike in Buffalo, New York, and a copper miners' strike in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The Coeur d'Alene strike was marked by gun battles between strikers and strikebreakers, and many deaths. A newspaper account of July 11, 1892, reported:<br>
<br>
... The long-dreaded conflict between the forces of the strikers and the nonunion men who have taken their places has come at last. As a result five men are known to be dead and 16 are already in the hospital; the Frisco mill on Canyon Creek is in ruins; the Gem mine has surrendered to the strikers, the arms of its employees have been captured, and the employees themselves have been ordered out of the country. Flushed with the success of these victories the turbulent element among the strikers are preparing to move upon other strongholds of the non-union men... .<br>
<br>
The National Guard, brought in by the governor, was reinforced by federal troops: six hundred miners were rounded up and imprisoned in bullpens, scabs brought back, union leaders fired, the strike broken.<br>
<br>
In early 1892, the Carnegie Steel plant at Homestead, Pennsylvania, just outside of Pittsburgh, was being managed by Henry Clay Frick while Carnegie was in Europe. Frick decided to reduce the workers' wages and break their union. He built a fence 3 miles long and 12 feet high around the steelworks and topped it with barbed wire, adding peepholes for rifles. When the workers did not accept the pay cut, Frick laid off the entire work force. The Pinkerton detective agency was hired to protect strikebreakers.<br>
<br>
Although only 750 of the 3,800 workers at Homestead belonged to the union, three thousand workers met in the Opera House and voted overwhelmingly to strike. The plant was on the Monongahela River, and a thousand pickets began patrolling a 10-mile stretch of the river. A committee of strikers took over the town, and the sheriff was unable to raise a posse among local people against them.<br>
<br>
On the night of July 5, 1892, hundreds of Pinkerton guards boarded barges 5 miles down the river from Homestead and moved toward the plant, where ten thousand strikers and sympathizers waited. The crowd warned the Pinkertons not to step off the barge. A striker lay down on the gangplank, and when a Pinkerton man tried to shove him aside, he fired, wounding the detective in the thigh. In the gunfire that followed on both sides, seven workers were killed.<br>
<br>
The Pinkertons had to retreat onto the barges. They were attacked from all sides, voted to surrender, and then were beaten by the enraged crowd. There were dead on both sides. For the next several days the strikers were in command of the area. Now the state went into action: the governor brought in the militia, armed with the latest rifles and Gatling guns, to protect the import of strikebreakers.<br>
<br>
Strike leaders were charged with murder; 160 other strikers were tried for other crimes. All were acquitted by friendly juries. The entire Strike Committee was then arrested for treason against the state, but no jury would convict them. The strike held for four months, but the plant was producing steel with strikebreakers who were brought in, often in locked trains, not knowing their destination, not knowing a strike was on. The strikers, with no resources left, agreed to return to work, their leaders blacklisted.<br>
<br>
One reason for the defeat was that the strike was confined to Homestead, and other plants of Carnegie kept working. Some blast furnace workers did strike, but they were quickly defeated, and the pig iron from those furnaces was then used at Homestead. The defeat kept unionization from the Carnegie plants well into the twentieth century, and the workers took wage cuts and increases in hours without organized resistance.<br>
<br>
In <a data-id=""7328182"" href=""/7328182/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/The"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">the</a> midst of the Homestead strike, a young anarchist from New York named Alexander Berkman, in a plan prepared by anarchist friends in New York, including his lover Emma Goldman, came to Pittsburgh and entered the office of Henry Clay Frick, determined to kill him. Berkman's aim was poor; he wounded Frick and was overwhelmed, then was tried and found guilty of attempted murder. He served fourteen years in the state penitentiary. His Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist gave a graphic description of the assassination attempt and of his years in prison, when he changed his mind about the usefulness of assassinations but remained a dedicated revolutionary. Emma Goldman's autobiography, Living My Life, conveys the anger, the sense of injustice, the desire for a new kind of life, that grew among the young radicals of that day.<br>
<br>
The year 1893 saw the biggest economic crisis in the country's history. After several decades of wild industrial growth, financial manipulation, uncontrolled speculation and profiteering, it all collapsed: 642 banks failed and 16,000 businesses closed down. Out of the labor force of 15 million, 3 million were unemployed. No state government voted relief, but mass demonstrations all over the country forced city governments to set up soup kitchens and give people work on streets or parks.<br>
<br>
In New York City, in Union Square, Emma Goldman addressed a huge meeting of the unemployed and urged those whose children needed food to go into the stores and take it. She was arrested for ""inciting to riot"" and sentenced to two years in prison. In Chicago, it was estimated that 200,000 people were without work, the floors and stairways of City Hall and the police stations packed every night with homeless men trying to sleep.<br>
<br>
The Depression lasted for years and brought a wave of strikes throughout the country. The largest of these was the nationwide strike of railroad workers in 1894 that began at the Pullman Company in Illinois, just outside of Chicago.<br>
<br>
Annual wages of railroad workers, according to the report of the commissioner of labor in 1890, were $957 for engineers, the aristocrats of the railroad-but $575 for conductors, $212 for brakemen, and $124 for laborers. Railroad work was one of the most dangerous jobs in America; over two thousand railroad workers were being killed each year, and thirty thousand injured. The railroad companies called these ""acts of God"" or the result of ""carelessness"" on the part of the workers, but the Locomotive Firemen's Magazine said: ""It comes to this: while railroad managers reduce their force and require men to do double duty, involving loss of rest and sleep . . . the accidents are chargeable to the greed of the corporation.""<br>
<br>
It was the Depression of 1893 that propelled Eugene Debs into a lifetime of action for unionism and socialism. Debs was from Terre Haute, Indiana, where his father and mother ran a store. He had worked on the railroads for four years until he was nineteen, but left when a friend was killed after falling under a locomotive. He came back to join a Railroad Brotherhood as a billing clerk. At the time of the great strikes of 1877, Debs opposed them and argued there was no ""necessary conflict between capital and labor."" But when he read Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward, it deeply affected him. He followed the events at Homestead, Coeur d'Alene, the Buffalo switchmen's strike, and wrote:<br>
<br>
If the year 1892 taught the world any lesson worthy of heed, it was that the capitalist class, like a devilfish, had grasped them with its tentacles and was dragging them down to fathomless depths of degradation. To escape the prehensile clutch of these monsters, constitutes a standing challenge to organized labor for 1893.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the economic crisis of 1893, a small group of railroad workers, including Debs, formed the American Railway Union, to unite all railway workers. Debs said:<br>
<br>
A life purpose of mine has been the federation of railroad employees. To unify them into one great body is my object. . . . Class enrollment fosters class prejudices and class selfishness. ... It has been my life's desire to unify railroad employees and to eliminate the aristocracy of labor ... and organize them so all will be on an equality. ...<br>
<br>
Knights of Labor people came in, virtually merging the old Knights with the American Railway Union, according to labor historian David Montgomery.<br>
<br>
Debs wanted to include everyone, but blacks were kept out: at a convention in 1894, the provision in the constitution barring blacks was affirmed by a vote of 112 to 100. Later, Debs thought this might have had a crucial effect on the outcome of the Pullman strike, for black workers were in no mood to cooperate with the strikers.<br>
<br>
In June 1894, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company went on strike. One can get an idea of the kind of support they got, mostly from the immediate vicinity of Chicago, in the first months of the strike, from a list of contributions put together by the Reverend William H. Carwardine, a Methodist pastor in the company town of Pullman for three years (he was sent away after he supported the strikers):<br>
<br>
Typographical Union #16<br>
Painters and Decorators Union #147<br>
Carpenters' Union No. 23<br>
Thirty- fourth Ward Republican Club<br>
Grand Crossing Police<br>
Hyde Park Water Department<br>
Picnic at Gardener's Park<br>
Milk Dealer's Union<br>
Hyde Park Liquor Dealers<br>
Fourteenth Precinct Police Station<br>
Swedish Concert<br>
Chicago Fire Department<br>
German Singing Society<br>
Cheque from Anaconda, Montana<br>
<br>
The Pullman strikers appealed to a convention of the American Railway Union for support:<br>
<br>
Mr. President and Brothers of the American Railway Union. We struck at Pullman because we were without hope. We joined the American Railway Union because it gave us a glimmer of hope. Twenty thousand souls, men, women and little ones, have their eyes turned toward this convention today, straining eagerly through dark despondency for a glimmer of the heavensent message you alone can give us on this earth... .<br>
<br>
You all must know that the proximate cause of our strike was the discharge of two members of our grievance committee.... Five reductions in wages.. .. The last was the most severe, amounting to nearly thirty per cent, and rents had not fallen. .. .<br>
<br>
Water which Pullman buys from the city at 8 cents a thousand gallons he retails lo us at 500 percent advance. .. . Gas which sells at 75 cents per thousand feet in Hyde Park, just north of us, he sells for $2.25. When we went to tell him our grievances he said we were all his ""children."".. .<br>
<br>
Pullman, both the man and the town, is an ulcer on the body politic. He owns the houses, the schoolhouses, and churches of God in the town he gave his once humble name....<br>
<br>
And thus the merry war-the dance of skeletons bathed in human tears-goes on, and it will go on, brothers, forever, unless you, the American Railway Union, stop it; end it; crush it out.<br>
<br>
The American Railway Union responded. It asked its members all over the country not to handle Pullman cars. Since virtually all passenger trains had Pullman cars, this amounted to a boycott of all trains-a nationwide strike. Soon all traffic on the twenty-four railroad lines leading out of Chicago had come to a halt. Workers derailed freight cars, blocked tracks, pulled engineers off trains if they refused to cooperate.<br>
<br>
The General Managers Association, representing the railroad owners, agreed to pay two thousand deputies, sent in to break the strike. But the strike went on. The Attorney General of the United States, Richard Olney, a former railroad lawyer, now got a court injunction against blocking trains, on the legal ground that the federal mails were being interfered with. When the strikers ignored the injunction, President Cleveland ordered federal troops to Chicago. On July 6, hundreds of cars were burned by strikers.<br>
<br>
The following day, the state militia moved in, and the Chicago Times reported on what followed:<br>
<br>
Company C. Second Regiment . . . disciplined a mob of rioters yesterday afternoon at Forty-ninth and Loomis Streets. The police assisted and . . . finished the job. There is no means of knowing how many rioters were killed or wounded. The mob carried off many of its dying and injured.<br>
<br>
A crowd of five thousand gathered. Rocks were thrown at the militia, and the command was given to fire.<br>
<br>
... To say that the mob went wild is but a weak expression.. . . The command to charge was given. . .. From that moment only bayonets were used. ... A dozen men in the front line of rioters received bayonet wounds. . ..<br>
<br>
Tearing up cobble stones, the mob made a determined charge.... the word was passed along the line for each officer to take care of himself. One by one, as occasion demanded, they fired point blank into the crowd.. .. The police followed with their clubs. A wire fence enclosed the track. The rioters had forgotten it; when they turned to fly they were caught in a trap.<br>
<br>
The police were not inclined to be merciful, and driving the mob against the barbed wires clubbed it unmercifully. .. . The crowd outside the fence rallied to the assistance of the rioters.... The shower of stones was incessant. . ..<br>
<br>
The ground over which the fight had occurred was like a battlefield. The men shot by the troops and police lay about like logs.. ..<br>
<br>
In Chicago that day, thirteen people were killed, fifty-three seriously wounded, seven hundred arrested. Before the strike was over, perhaps thirty-four were dead. With fourteen thousand police, militia, troops in Chicago, the strike was crushed. Debs was arrested for contempt of court, for violating the injunction that said he could not do or say anything to carry on the strike. He told the court: ""It seems to me that if it were not for resistance to degrading conditions, the tendency of our whole civilization would be downward; after a while we would reach the point where there would be no resistance, and slavery would come.""<br>
<br>
Debs, in court, denied he was a socialist. But during his six months in prison, he studied socialism and talked to fellow prisoners who were socialists. Later he wrote: ""I was to be baptized in Socialism in the roar of conflict... in the gleam of every bayonet and the flash of every rifle the class struggle was revealed. ... This was my first practical struggle in Socialism.""<br>
<br>
Two years after he came out of prison, Debs wrote in the Railway Times:<br>
<br>
The issue is Socialism versus Capitalism. I am for Socialism because I am for humanity. We have been cursed with the reign of gold long enough. Money constitutes no proper basis of civilization. The time has come to regenerate society-we are on the eve of a universal change.<br>
<br>
Thus, the eighties and nineties saw bursts of labor insurrection, more organized than the spontaneous strikes of 1877. There were now revolutionary movements influencing labor struggles, the ideas of socialism affecting labor leaders. Radical literature was appearing, speaking of fundamental changes, of new possibilities for living.<br>
<br>
In this same period, those who worked on the land-farmers, North and South, black and white-were going far beyond the scattered tenant protests of the pre-Civil War years and creating the greatest movement of agrarian rebellion the country had ever seen.<br>
<br>
When the Homestead Act was being discussed in Congress in 1860, a Senator from Wisconsin said he supported it:<br>
<br>
.. . because its benign operation will postpone for centuries, if it will not forever, all serious conflict between capital and labor in the older free States, withdrawing their surplus population to create in greater abundance the means of subsistence.<br>
<br>
The Homestead Act did not have that effect. It did not bring tranquility to the East by moving Americans to the West. It was not a safety valve for discontent, which was too great to be contained that way. As Henry Nash Smith says (Virgin Land), and as we have seen: ""On the contrary, the three decades following its passage were marked by the most bitter and widespread labor trouble that had yet been seen in the United States.""<br>
<br>
It also failed to bring peace to the farm country of the West. Hamlin Garland, who made so many Americans aware of the life of the farmer, wrote in the preface to his novel Jason Edwards: 'Tree land is gone. The last acre of available farmland has now passed into private or corporate hands."" In Jason Edwards a Boston mechanic takes his family West, drawn by advertising circulars. But he finds that all land within 30 miles of a railroad has been taken up by speculators. He struggles for five years to pay off a loan and get title to his farm, and then a storm destroys his wheat just before harvest.<br>
<br>
Behind the despair so often registered in the farm country literature of that day, there must have been visions, from time to time, of a different way to live. In another Garland novel, A Spoil of Office, the heroine speaks at a farmers' picnic:<br>
<br>
I see a time when the farmer will not need to live in a cabin on a lonely farm. I see the farmers coming together in groups. I see them with time to read, and time to visit with their fellows. I see them enjoying lectures in beautiful halls, erected in every village. I see them gather like the Saxons of old upon the green at evening to sing and dance. I see cities rising near them with schools, and churches, and concert halls and theaters. I see a day when the farmer will no longer be a drudge and his wife a bond slave, but happy men and women who will go singing to their pleasant tasks upon their fruitful farms. When the boys and girls will not go west nor to the city; when life will be worth living. In that day the moon will be brighter and the stars more glad, and pleasure and poetry and love of life come back to the man who tills the soil.<br>
<br>
Hamlin Garland dedicated Jason Edwards, written in 1891, to the Farmers Alliance. It was the Farmers Alliance that was the core of the great movement of the 1880s and 1890s later known as the Populist Movement.<br>
<br>
Between 1860 and 1910, the U.S. army, wiping out the Indian villages on the Great Plains, paved the way for the railroads to move in and take the best land. Then the farmers came for what was left. From 1860 to 1900 the population of the United States grew from 31 million to 75 million; now 20 million people lived west of the Mississippi, and the number of farms grew from 2 million to 6 million. With the crowded cities of the East needing food, the internal market for food was more than doubled; 82 percent of the farm produce was sold inside the United States.<br>
<br>
Farming became mechanized-steel plows, mowing machines, reapers, harvesters, improved cotton gins for pulling the fibers away from the seed, and, by the turn of the century, giant combines that cut the grain, threshed it, and put it in bags. In 1830 a bushel of wheat had taken three hours to produce. By 1900, it took ten minutes. Specialization developed by region: cotton and tobacco in the South, wheat and corn in the Midwest.<br>
<br>
Land cost money, and machines cost money-so farmers had to borrow, hoping that the prices of their harvests would stay high, so they could pay the bank for the loan, the railroad for transportation, the grain merchant for handling their grain, the storage elevator for storing it. But they found the prices for their produce going down, and the prices of transportation and loans going up, because the individual farmer could not control the price of his grain, while the monopolist railroad and the monopolist banker could charge what they liked.<br>
<br>
William Faulkner, in his novel The Hamlet, described the man on whom southern farmers depended:<br>
<br>
He was the largest landholder ... in one county, and Justice of the Peace in the next, and election commissioner in both.... He was a farmer, a usurer, a veterinarian.... He owned most of the good land in the county and held mortgages on most of the rest. He owned the store and the cotton gin and the combined grist mill and blacksmith shop.. ..<br>
<br>
The farmers who could not pay saw their homes and land taken away. They became tenants. By 1880, 25 percent of all farms were rented by tenants, and the number kept rising. Many did not even have money to rent and became farm laborers; by 1900 there were 4 1/2 million farm laborers in the country. It was the fate that awaited every farmer who couldn't pay his debts.<br>
<br>
Could the squeezed and desperate farmer turn to the government for help? Lawrence Goodwyn, in his study of the Populist movement (The Democratic Promise), says that after the Civil War both parties now were controlled by capitalists. They were divided along North-South lines, still hung over with the animosities of the Civil War. This made it very hard to create a party of reform cutting across both parties to unite working people South and North-to say nothing of black and white, foreign-born and native-born.<br>
<br>
The government played its part in helping the bankers and hurting the farmers; it kept the amount of money-based on the gold supply- steady, while the population rose, so there was less and less money in circulation. The farmer had to pay off his debts in dollars that were harder to get. The bankers, getting the loans back, were getting dollars worth more than when they loaned them out-a kind of interest on top of interest. That is why so much of the talk of farmers' movements in those days had to do with putting more money in circulation-by printing greenbacks (paper money for which there was no gold in the treasury) or by making silver a basis for issuing money.<br>
<br>
It was in Texas that the Farmers Alliance movement began. It was in the South that the crop-lien system was most brutal. By this system the farmer would get the things he needed from the merchant: the use of the cotton gin at harvest time, whatever supplies were necessary. He didn't have money to pay, so the merchant would get a lien-a mortgage on his crop-on which the farmer might pay 25 percent interest. Goodwyn says ""the crop lien system became for millions of Southerners, white and black, little more than a modified form of slavery."" The man with the ledger became to the farmer ""the furnishing man,"" to black farmers simply ""the Man."" The farmer would owe more money every year until finally his farm was taken away and he became a tenant.<br>
<br>
Goodwyn gives two personal histories to illustrate this. A white farmer in South Carolina, between 1887 and 1895, bought goods and services from the furnishing merchant for $2,681.02 but was able to pay only $687.31, and finally he had to give his land to the merchant. A black farmer named Matt Brown, in Black Hawk, Mississippi, between 1884 and 1901, bought his supplies from the Jones store, kept falling further and further behind, and in 1905 the last entry in the merchant's ledger is for a coffin and burial supplies.<br>
<br>
How many rebellions took place against this system we don't know. In Delhi, Louisiana, in 1889, a gathering of small farmers rode into town and demolished the stores of merchants ""to cancel their indebtedness,"" they said.<br>
<br>
In the height of the 1877 Depression, a group of white farmers gathered together on a farm in Texas and formed the first ""Farmers Alliance."" In a few years, it was across the state. By 1882, there were 120 suballiances in twelve counties. By 1886, 100,000 farmers had joined in two thousand suballiances. They began to offer alternatives to the old system: join the Alliance and form cooperatives; buy things together and get lower prices. They began putting their cotton together and selling it cooperatively-they called it ""bulking.""<br>
<br>
In some states a Grange movement developed; it managed to get laws passed to help farmers. But the Grange, as one of its newspapers put it, ""is essentially conservative and furnishes a stable, well- organized, rational and orderly opposition to encroachments upon the liberties of the people, in contrast to the lawless, desperate attempts of communism."" It was a time of crisis, and the Grange was doing too little. It lost members, while the Farmers Alliance kept growing.<br>
<br>
From the beginning, the Farmers Alliance showed sympathy with the growing labor movement. When Knights of Labor men went on strike against a steamship line in Galveston, Texas, one of the radical leaders of the Texas Alliance, William Lamb, spoke for many (but not all) Alliance members when he said in an open letter to Alliance people: ""Knowing that the day is not far distant when the Farmers Alliance will have to use Boycott on manufacturers in order to get goods direct, we think it is a good time to help the Knights of Labor. . .."" Goodwyn says: ""Alliance radicalism- Populism-began with this letter.""<br>
<br>
The Texas Alliance president opposed joining the boycott, but a group of Alliance people in Texas passed a resolution:<br>
<br>
Whereas we see the unjust encroachments that the capitalists are making upon all the different departments of labor ... we extend to the Knights of Labor our hearty sympathy in their manly struggle against monopolistic oppression and ... we propose to stand by the Knights.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1886, in the town of Cleburne, near Dallas, the Alliance gathered and drew up what came to be known as the ""Cleburne Demands""-the first document of the Populist movement, asking ""such legislation as shall secure to our people freedom from the onerous and shameful abuses that the industrial classes are now suffering at the hands of arrogant capitalists and powerful corporations."" They called for a national conference of all labor organizations ""to discuss such measures as may be of interest to the laboring classes,"" and proposed regulation of railroad rates, heavy taxation of land held only for speculative purposes, and an increase in the money supply.<br>
<br>
The Alliance kept growing. By early 1887, it had 200,000 members in three thousand suballiances. By 1892 farmer lecturers had gone into forty-three states and reached 2 million farm families in what Goodwyn calls ""the most massive organizing drive by any citizen institution of nineteenth century America,"" It was a drive based on the idea of cooperation, of farmers creating their own culture, their own political parties, gaining a respect not given them by the nation's powerful industrial and political leaders.<br>
<br>
Organizers from Texas came to Georgia to form alliances, and in three years Georgia had 100,000 members in 134 of the 137 counties. In Tennessee, there were soon 125,000 members and 3,600 suballiances in ninety-two of the state's ninety-six counties. The Alliance moved into Mississippi ""like a cyclone,"" someone said, and into Louisiana and North Carolina. Then northward into Kansas and the Dakotas, where thirty-five cooperative warehouses were set up.<br>
<br>
One of the leading figures in Kansas was Henry Vincent, who started a journal in 1886 called The American Nonconformist and Kansas Industrial Liberator, saying in the first issue:<br>
<br>
This journal will aim to publish such matter as will tend to the education of the laboring classes, the farmers and the producer, and in every struggle it will endeavor to take the side of the oppressed as against the oppressor.. ..<br>
<br>
By 1889, the Kansas Alliance had fifty thousand members and was electing local candidates to office.<br>
<br>
Now there were 400,000 members in the National Farmers Alliance. And the conditions spurring the Alliance onward got worse. Corn which had brought 45 cents a bushel in 1870 brought 10 cents a bushel in 1889. Harvesting wheat required a machine to bind the wheat before it became too dry, and this cost several hundred dollars, which the farmer had to buy on credit, knowing the $200 would be twice as hard to get in a few years. Then he had pay a bushel of corn in freight costs for every bushel he shipped. He had to pay the high prices demanded by the grain elevators at the terminals. In the South the situation was worse than anywhere-90 percent of the farmers lived on credit.<br>
<br>
To meet this situation, the Texas Alliance formed a statewide cooperative, a great Texas Exchange, which handled the selling of the farmers' cotton in one great transaction. But the Exchange itself needed loans to advance credit to its members; the banks refused. A call was issued to farmers to scrape together the needed capital for the Exchange to operate. Thousands came on June 9, 1888, to two hundred Texas courthouses and made their contributions, pledging $200,000. Ultimately, $80,000 was actually collected. It was not enough. The farmers' poverty prevented them from helping themselves. The banks won, and this persuaded the Alliances that monetary reform was crucial.<br>
<br>
There was one victory along the way. Farmers were being charged too much for jute bags (to put cotton in), which were controlled by a trust. The Alliance farmers organized a boycott of jute, made their own bags out of cotton, and forced the jute manufacturers to start selling their bags at 5 cents a yard instead of 14 cents.<br>
<br>
The complexity of Populist belief was shown in one of its important leaders in Texas, Charles Macune. He was a radical in economics (antitrust, and capitalist), a conservative in politics (against a new party independent of the Democrats), and a racist. Macune came forward with a plan that was to become central to the Populist platform-the sub-Treasury plan. The government would have its own warehouses where farmers would store produce and get certificates from this sub-Treasury. These would be greenbacks, and thus much more currency would be made available, not dependent on gold or silver, but based on the amount of farm produce.<br>
<br>
There were more Alliance experiments. In the Dakotas, a great cooperative insurance plan for farmers insured them against loss of their crops. Where the big insurance companies had asked 50 cents an acre, the cooperative asked 25 cents or less. It issued thirty thousand policies, covering 2 million acres.<br>
<br>
Macune's sub-Treasury plan depended on the government. And since it would not be taken up by the two major parties, it meant (against Macune's own beliefs) organizing a third party. The Alliances went to work. In 1890 thirty-eight Alliance people were elected to Congress. In the South, the Alliance elected governors in Georgia and Texas. It took over the Democratic party in Georgia and won three-fourths of the seats in the Georgia legislature, six of Georgia's ten congressmen.<br>
<br>
This was, however, Goodwyn says, ""an elusive revolution, because the party machinery remained in the hands of the old crowd, and the crucial chairmanships of important committees, in Congress, in the state legislatures, remained in the hands of the conservatives, and corporate power, in the states, in the nation, could use its money to still get what it wanted.""<br>
<br>
The Alliances were not getting real power, but they were spreading new ideas and a new spirit. Now, as a political party, they became the People's party (or Populist party), and met in convention in 1890 in Topeka, Kansas. The great Populist orator from that state, Mary Ellen Lease, told an enthusiastic crowd:<br>
<br>
Wall Street owns the country. It is no longer a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a government of Wall Street, by Wall Street and for Wall Street.... Our laws are the output of a system which clothes rascals in robes and honesty in rags. . .. the politicians said we suffered from overproduction. Overproduction, when 10,000 little children . .. starve to death every year in the U.S. and over 100,000 shop girls in New York are forced to sell their virtue for bread. ,..<br>
<br>
There <a data-id=""7332752"" href=""/7332752/Howard-zinn-chapter-11-robber-barons-and-rebels/Are"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">are</a> thirty men in the United States whose aggregate wealth is over one and one-half billion dollars. There are half a million looking for work.. .. We want money, land and transportation. We want the abolition of the National Banks, and we want the power to make loans direct from the government. We want the accursed foreclosure system wiped out. . . . We will stand by our homes and stay by our firesides by force if necessary, and we will not pay our debts to the loan-shark companies until the Government pays its debts to us.<br>
<br>
The people are at bay, let the bloodhounds of money who have dogged us thus far beware.<br>
<br>
At the People's party national convention in 1892 in St. Louis, a platform was drawn up. The preamble was written by, and read to the assemblage by, another of the great orators of the movement, Ignatius Donnelly:<br>
<br>
We meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral, political and material ruin. Corruption dominates the ballot box, the legislatures, the Congress, and touches even the ermine of the bench. These people are demoralized. . .. The newspapers are subsidized or muzzled; public opinion silenced; business prostrate, our homes covered with mortgages, labor impoverished, and the land concentrating in the hands of capitalists.<br>
<br>
The urban workmen are denied the right of organization for self-protection; imported pauperized labor beats down their wages; a hireling standing army . .. established to shoot them down... . The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes. . .. From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed two classes-paupers and millionaires... .<br>
<br>
A People's party nominating convention in Omaha in July of 1892 nominated James Weaver, an Iowa Populist and former general in the Union army, for President. The Populist movement was now tied to the voting system. Their spokesman Polk had said they could ""link their hands and hearts together and march to the ballot box and take possession of the government, restore it to the principles of our fathers, and run it in the interest of the people."" Weaver got over a million votes, but lost.<br>
<br>
A new political party had the job of uniting diverse groups-northern Republicans and southern Democrats, urban workers and country farmers, black and white. A Colored Farmers National Alliance grew in the South and had perhaps a million members, but it was organized and led by whites. There were also black organizers, but it was not easy for them to persuade black farmers that, even if economic reforms were won, blacks would have equal access to them. Blacks had tied themselves to the Republican party, the party of Lincoln and civil rights laws. The Democrats were the party of slavery and segregation. As Goodwyn puts it, ""in an era of transcendent white prejudice, the curbing of 'vicious corporate monopoly' did not carry for black farmers the ring of salvation it had for white agrarians.""<br>
<br>
There were whites who saw the need for racial unity. One Alabama newspaper wrote:<br>
<br>
The white and colored Alliance are united in their war against trusts, and in the promotion of the doctrine that farmers should establish cooperative stores, and manufactures, and publish their own newspapers, conduct their own schools, and have a hand in everything else that concerns them as citizens or affects them personally or collectively.<br>
<br>
The official newspaper of the Alabama Knights of Labor, the Alabama Sentinel, wrote: ""The Bourbon Democracy are trying to down the Alliance with the old cry 'nigger'. It won't work though.""<br>
<br>
Some Alliance blacks made similar calls for unity. A leader of the Florida Colored Alliance said: ""We are aware of the fact that the laboring colored man's interests and the laboring white man's interest are one and the same.""<br>
<br>
When the Texas People's party was founded in Dallas in the summer of 1891, it was interracial, and radical. There was blunt and vigorous debate among whites and blacks. A black delegate, active in the Knights of Labor, dissatisfied with vague statements about ""equality,"" said:<br>
<br>
If we are equal, why does not the sheriff summon Negroes on juries? And why hang up the sign ""Negro"", in passenger cars. I want to tell my people what the People's Party is going to do. I want to tell them if it is going to work a black and white horse in the same field.<br>
<br>
A white leader responded by urging there be a black delegate from every district in the state. ""They are in the ditch just like we are."" When someone suggested there be separate white and black Populist clubs which would ""confer together,"" R. M. Humphrey, the white leader of the Colored Alliance, objected: ""This will not do. The colored people are part of the people and they must be recognized as such."" Two blacks were then elected to the state executive committee of the party.<br>
<br>
Blacks and whites were in different situations. The blacks were mostly field hands, hired laborers; most white Alliance people were farm owners. When the Colored Alliance declared a strike in the cotton fields in 1891 for a dollar a day wages for cotton pickers, Leonidas Polk, head of the white Alliance, denounced it as hurting the Alliance farmer who would have to pay that wage. In Arkansas, a thirty-year-old black cotton picker named Ben Patterson led the strike, traveling from plantation to plantation to get support, his band growing, engaging in gun battles with a white posse. A plantation manager was killed, a cotton gin burned. Patterson and his band were caught, and fifteen of them were shot to death.<br>
<br>
There was some black-white unity at the ballot box in the South- resulting in a few blacks elected in North Carolina local elections. An Alabama white farmer wrote to a newspaper in 1892: ""I wish to God that Uncle Sam could put bayonets around the ballot box in the black belt on the first Monday in August so that the Negro could get a fair vote."" There were black delegates to third- party conventions in Georgia: two in 1892, twenty-four in 1894, The Arkansas People's party platform spoke for the ""downtrodden, regardless of race.""<br>
<br>
There were moments of racial unity. Lawrence Goodwyn found in east Texas an unusual coalition of black and white public officials: it had begun during Reconstruction and continued into the Populist period. The state government was in the control of white Democrats, but in Grimes County, blacks won local offices and sent legislators to the state capital. The district clerk was a black man; there were black deputy sheriffs and a black school principal. A night-riding White Man's Union used intimidation and murder to split the coalition, but Goodwyn points to ""the long years of interracial cooperation in Grimes County"" and wonders about missed opportunities.<br>
<br>
Racism was strong, and the Democratic party played on this, winning many farmers from the Populist party. When white tenants, failing in the crop-lien system, were evicted from their land and replaced by blacks, race hatred intensified. Southern states were drawing up new constitutions, starting with Mississippi in 1890, to prevent blacks from voting by various devices, and to maintain ironclad segregation in every aspect of life.<br>
<br>
The laws that took the vote away from blacks-poll taxes, literacy tests, property qualifications-also often ensured that poor whites would not vote. And the political leaders of the South knew this. At the constitutional convention in Alabama, one of the leaders said he wanted to take away the vote from ""all those who are unfit and unqualified, and if the rule strikes a white man as well as a negro let him go."" In North Carolina, the Charlotte Observer saw disfranchisement as ""the struggle of the white people of North Carolina to rid themselves of the dangers of the rule of negroes and the lower class of whites.""<br>
<br>
Tom Watson, the Populist leader of Georgia, pleaded for racial unity:<br>
<br>
You are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings. You are made to hate each other because upon that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both. You are deceived and blinded that you may not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars both.<br>
<br>
According to the black scholar Robert Alien, taking a look at Populism (Reluctant Reformers), Watson wanted black support for a white man's party. No doubt, when Watson found this support embarrassing and no longer useful, he became as eloquent in affirming racism as he had been in opposing it.<br>
<br>
Still, Watson must have addressed some genuine feelings in poor whites whose class oppression gave them some common interest with blacks. When H. S. Doyle, a young black preacher who supported Watson for Congress, was threatened by a lynch mob, he came to Watson for protection, and two thousand white farmers helped Doyle escape.<br>
<br>
It was a time that illustrated the complexities of class and race conflict. Fifteen blacks were lynched during Watson's election campaign. And in Georgia after 1891 the Alliance-controlled legislature, Alien points out, ""passed the largest number of anti-black bills ever enacted in a single year in Georgia history."" And yet, in 1896, the Georgia state platform of the People's party denounced lynch law and terrorism, and asked the abolition of the convict lease system.<br>
<br>
C. Vann Woodward points to the unique quality of the Populist experience in the South: ""Never before or since have the two races in the South come so close together as they did during the Populist struggles.""<br>
<br>
The Populist movement also made a remarkable attempt to create a new and independent culture for the country's farmers. The Alliance Lecture Bureau reached all over the country; it had 35,000 lecturers. The Populists poured out books and pamphlets from their printing presses. Woodward says:<br>
<br>
One gathers from yellowed pamphlets that the agrarian ideologists undertook to re-educate their countrymen from the ground up. Dismissing ""history as taught in our schools"" as ""practically valueless"", they undertook to write it over-formidable columns of it, from the Greek down. With no more compunction they turned all hands to the revision of economics, political theory, law, and government.<br>
<br>
The National Economist, a Populist magazine, had 100,000 readers. Goodwyn counts over a thousand Populist journals in the 1890s. There were newspapers like the Comrade, published in the cotton country of Louisiana, and the Toiler's Friend, in rural Georgia. Also, Revolution was published in Georgia. In North Carolina, the Populist printing plant was burned. In Alabama, there was the Living Truth. It was broken into in 1892, its type scattered, and the next year the shop was set afire, but the press survived and the editor never missed an issue.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of poems and songs came out of the Populist movement, like ""The Farmer Is the Man"": . . . the farmer is the man<br>
The Farmer is the man<br>
Lives on credit till the fall<br>
With the interest rates so high<br>
It's a wonder he don't die<br>
And the mortgage man's the one<br>
That gets it all.<br>
<br>
The farmer is the man<br>
The farmer is the man<br>
Lives on credit till the fall<br>
And his pants are wearing thin<br>
His condition it's a sin<br>
He's forgot that he's the man<br>
That feeds them all.<br>
<br>
Books written by Populist leaders, such as Henry Demarest Lloyd's Wealth Against Commonwealth, and William Harvey Coin's Financial School, were widely read. An Alabama historian of that time, William Garrott Brown, said about the Populist movement that ""no other political movement-not that of 1776, nor that of 1860-1861-ever altered Southern life so profoundly.""<br>
<br>
According to Lawrence Goodwyn, if the labor movement had been able to do in the cities what the Populists did in the rural areas, ""to create among urban workers a culture of cooperation, self- respect, and economic analysis,"" there might have been a great movement for change in the United States. There were only fitful, occasional connections between the farmer and labor movements. Neither spoke eloquently enough to the other's needs. And yet, there were signs of a common consciousness that might, under different circumstances, lead to a unified, ongoing movement.<br>
<br>
Norman Pollack says, on the basis of a close study of midwestern Populist newspapers, that ""Populism regarded itself as a class movement, reasoning that farmers and workers were assuming the same material position in society."" An editorial in the Farmers' Alliance spoke of a man working fourteen to sixteen hours a day: ""He is brutalized both morally and physically. He has no ideas, only propensities, he has no beliefs, only instincts."" Pollack sees that as a homespun version of Marx's idea of workers' alienation from his human self under capitalism, and finds many other parallels between Populist and Marxist ideas.<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly, Populists, along with most white Americans, had racism and nativism in their thinking. But part of it was that they simply did not think race as important as the economic system. Thus, the Farmers' Alliance said: ""The people's party has sprung into existence not to make the black man free, but to emancipate all men ... to gain for all industrial freedom, without which there can be no political freedom. . . .""<br>
<br>
More important than theoretical connections were the Populist expressions of support for workers in actual struggles. The Alliance-Independent of Nebraska, during the great strike at the Carnegie steel plant, wrote: ""All who look beneath the surface will see that the bloody battle fought at Homestead was a mere incident in the great conflict between capital and labor."" Coxey's march of the unemployed drew sympathy in the farm areas; in Osceola, Nebraska, perhaps five thousand people attended a picnic in Coxey's honor. During the Pullman strike, a farmer wrote to the governor of Kansas: ""Unquestionably, nearly, if not quite all Alliance people are in fullest sympathy with these striking men.""<br>
<br>
On top of the serious failures to unite blacks and whites, city workers and country farmers, there was the lure of electoral politics-all of that combining to destroy the Populist movement. Once allied with the Democratic party in supporting William Jennings Bryan for President in 1896, Populism would drown in a sea of Democratic politics. The pressure for electoral victory led Populism to make deals with the major parties in city after city. If the Democrats won, it would be absorbed. If the Democrats lost, it would disintegrate. Electoral polities brought into the top leadership the political brokers instead of the agrarian radicals.<br>
<br>
There were those radical Populists who saw this. They said fusion with the Democrats to try to ""win"" would lose what they needed, an independent political movement. They said the much- ballyhooed free silver would not change anything fundamental in the capitalist system. One Texas radical said silver coinage would ""leave undisturbed all the conditions which give rise to the undue concentration of wealth.""<br>
<br>
Henry Demarest Lloyd noted that the Bryan nomination was subsidized in part by Marcus Daly (of Anaconda Copper) and William Randolph Hearst (of the silver interests in the West). He saw through the rhetoric of Bryan that stirred the crowd of twenty thousand at the Democratic Convention (""we have petitioned, and our petitions have been scorned; we have entreated, and our entreaties have been disregarded; we have begged, and they have mocked when our calamity came. We beg no longer; we entreat no more, we petition no more. We defy them!""). Lloyd wrote bitterly:<br>
<br>
The poor people are throwing up their hats in the air for those who promise to lead them out of the wilderness by way of the currency route. . .. The people are to be kept wandering forty years in the currency labyrinth, as they have for the last forty years been led up and down the tariff bill.<br>
<br>
In the election of 1896, with the Populist movement enticed into the Democratic party, Bryan, the Democratic candidate, was defeated by William McKinley, for whom the corporations and the press mobilized, in the first massive use of money in an election campaign. Even the hint of Populism in the Democratic party, it seemed, could not be tolerated, and the big guns of the Establishment pulled out all their ammunition, to make sure.<br>
<br>
It was a time, as election times have often been in the United States, to consolidate the system after years of protest and rebellion. The black was being kept under control in the South. The Indian was being driven off the western plains for good; on a cold winter day in 1890, U.S. army soldiers attacked Indians camped at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, and killed three hundred men, women, and children. It was the climax to four hundred years of violence that began with Columbus, establishing that this continent belonged to white men. But only to certain white men, because it was clear by 1896 that the state stood ready to crush labor strikes, by the law if possible, by force if necessary. And where a threatening mass movement developed, the two-party system stood ready to send out one of its columns to surround that movement and drain it of vitality.<br>
<br>
And always, as a way of drowning class resentment in a flood of slogans for national unity, there was patriotism. McKinley had said, in a rare rhetorical connection between money and flag:<br>
<br>
... this year is going to be a year of patriotism and devotion to country. I am glad to know that the people in every part of the country mean to be devoted to one flag, the glorious Stars and Stripes; that the people of this country mean to maintain the financial honor of the country as sacredly as they maintain the honor of the flag.<br>
<br>
The supreme act of patriotism was war. Two years after McKinley became President, the United States declared war on Spain.</p>

"<p>[Letra de ""lo que hay x aquí""]<br>
<br>
[Intro]<br>
¿Yo nunca te he hablado de ella?<br>
Ella era como... como una puesta de sol, ¿sabes?<br>
Como ver el mar después de mucho tiempo<br>
Mi hogar<br>
<br>
[Pre-Estribillo]<br>
¿Quién estará besando esos labio'?<br>
Me tiene pensando y yo antes no era así<br>
Seguro es un tipo más guapo que yo<br>
Ella era demasiado guapa para mí<br>
Dime de qué sirve toda esta ambición<br>
Si al llegar no tengo con quien compartir<br>
Que no la perdiera mamá me avisó<br>
Y yo como un tonto fue que la perdí<br>
Ya no tengo a quien mandar estos TikToks<br>
Ni con quien criticar todo antes de dormir<br>
Sus amigas dicen que es mejor que yo<br>
Y que se la ve mucho mejor así<br>
<br>
[Estribillo]<br>
Y aunque duela, es verdad<br>
Porque ser mejor es muy fácil<br>
¿Y pa' qué iba a volver a buscarme?<br>
Si no echa de meno' lo que hay por aquí, yeah<br>
<br>
[Verso]<br>
Amanecí pensando en ti, mi amor<br>
Entré a tus redes pa' ver cómo estás<br>
Vi que hace poco cambiaste de look<br>
Y aún no borraste las fotos nuestras<br>
Me salió un recuerdo de nosotros do'<br>
De la noche desnudo' bebiendo en el mar<br>
Y me puso triste pensar que ya no<br>
Y que hay otro que ahora ocupa mi lugar<br>
Por lo menos ahora no te piden fotos entrando en el cine o en el restaurant<br>
Y toda' las cosa' que querías hacer y que por ser quien soy tuviste que cortar<br>
Ojalá que guardes el primer anillo que pude comprarte con la música<br>
Y que me recuerdes como el primer día, oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Skinny<br>
<br>
[Pre-Estribillo]<br>
¿Quién estará besando esos labios?<br>
Me tiene pensando y yo antes no era así<br>
Seguro es un tipo más guapo que yo<br>
Ella era demasiado guapa para mí<br>
Dime de qué sirve toda esta ambición<br>
Si al llegar no tengo con quien compartir<br>
Que no la perdiera mamá me avisó<br>
Y yo como un tonto fue que la perdí<br>
<br>
[Estribillo]<br>
Y aunque duela, es verdad<br>
Porque ser mejor es muy fácil<br>
¿Y pa' qué iba a volver a buscarme?<br>

"<h1>What Are The Best Selling Songs of All Time?</h1><p>There is no single source that can claim to have the <a href=""https://soulmatetwinflame.com/index.php/2022/07/18/best-selling-songs-of-all-time/"" data-real-link=""true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">best selling songs</a> of all time. Estimates of global sales have been compiled from a variety of sources. However, some sales figures may be inflated by record companies. Nevertheless, there are some songs that have made the list over the years, and some have been ranked as the best selling.</p>

<h2>Celine Dion's love theme for Titanic</h2><p>""My Heart Will Go On"" is a powerful, emotional ballad that was written for the film Titanic. The song is sung by Celine Dion, who was the most popular singer of her day. While she had been initially reluctant to record the song, she soon changed her mind after hearing a demo. It has since become one of the most successful songs of all time.<br>
Celine Dion originally didn't want to record another movie theme, and she initially mouthed ""I don't want to do that song!"" to her manager. However, her manager pressed her to record the song, and she agreed.<br>
The success of the song is largely due to Celine Dion's incredible voice. It captures the themes of the film and communicates the depth of Rose's love for Jack. The song has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and has become one of the most popular songs of all time.<br>
Despite the fact that it was written for a movie, the song has actually sold more than two million copies in the US alone. It was also the winner of the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. The song is also the second-most streamed song in the US.</p>

<h2>Celine Dion's Silent Night</h2><p>The song was initially a minor hit, but it became one of the biggest selling songs of all time. It became the official theme song of the film Titanic. The original recording was done in just one take. However, a remix in 1991 made the song even more popular.<br>
Despite its traditional roots, ""Silent Night"" has evolved from its humble beginnings in a small village in Austria 200 years ago. Since then, it has been performed on countless recordings and was instrumental in bringing nations together during World War I. It's even been designated a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.<br>
Celine Dion's version is very different. She offers a warm, calming voice. The song is likely to be heard throughout the holidays, and its lyrics are ideal for sharing with loved ones. Her vocals are also rich and smooth, making it a great choice for a Christmas playlist.<br>
""Silent Night"" is also one of the best-known songs from the musical genre. The original was composed by Franz Xaver Gruber in 1818. He wrote the lyrics for Joseph Mohr, and it has been recorded by a variety of singers. The Bing Crosby version of the song was the fourth best-selling single of all time.<br>
""My Way"" by Elvis Presley is another classic. This song was recorded by the crooner on May 29, 1942. It has sold more than fifty million copies worldwide. This song was so popular that it has been listed in the Guinness Book of Records.</p>

<h2>Pharrell Williams' Happy</h2><p>Pharrell Williams has made a name for himself as one of the most influential and successful songwriters of our generation. The singer-producer has been involved in various projects, including co-producing the smash hit albums by Justin Timberlake and Daft Punk. He has also had a hand in designing clothing, and he has a knack for marketing.<br>
""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams is a bouncy, feel-good tune that has become a hit for both the artist and the music industry. Its title may not make it sound like an uplifting song, but it has quickly become a genre classic and has topped the charts. A stunning video accompanying the song, ""24 Hours of Happy,"" showcases the joy that the track evokes.<br>
""Happy"" was written by Pharrell Williams for the Despicable Me movie soundtrack. The production team declined to use any of his previous songs, so Happy is a unique piece of work. It was later reissued on December 16, 2013 as a standalone song and was the lead single from his album Girl. It became Williams' first #1 Billboard Hot 100 single as a lead artist and was certified a diamond by the RIA.<br>
The song ""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams has become a global hit, reaching the top spot on Billboard's Hot 100 and topping charts in over 75 countries around the world. Now Pharrell Williams has translated the hit song into a picture book for the youngest readers. Featuring a range of child photographs from all over the world, this book is full of memorable childhood moments.</p>

<h2>Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You</h2><p>Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" is one of the best-selling songs of all time. Houston's version of the song was released in 1992 for the film The Bodyguard, where it spent 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It still holds the record for being the best-selling single by a woman in the history of recorded music. Since Whitney Houston's death in 2012, her version has been covered by many artists.<br>
The song was originally a country ballad written by Dolly Parton. The resulting recording was lavishly produced, and it quickly became one of Houston's most popular songs, selling millions of copies. The recording also had an incredibly broad appeal, becoming a staple dance song throughout the world.<br>
After its release in 1990, Houston recorded another version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. It had previously been featured in the 1991 movie Fried Green Tomatoes. The film's director, Mick Jackson, approached Clive Davis to get a recording of the song for the movie. The song had been recorded by other artists, including Linda Ronstadt.<br>
""Hollywood"" debuted at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It went on to become Whitney Houston's tenth number one single. The song won many awards, including the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It also won the 1992 Soul Train Music Award and the R&amp;B Song of the Year. It is the longest-running number-one single from a movie soundtrack.</p>

<h2>Ed Sheeran's Shape of You</h2><p>Ed Sheeran's ""Shape of You"" is spending its seventh week atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song has nearly double the number of chart points of its nearest competitor. Compared to ""I Will Always Love You,"" the song sold more than 41.5 million copies.<br>
The song ""Shape of You"" is one of the most popular songs of all time. It is Ed Sheeran's second best-selling single, and has sold over 42 million copies worldwide. It has also set a new record for the number of digital copies sold. It was released in January 2017, and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance.<br>
The song has received a lot of criticism for copyright infringement. The song was accused of stealing a part of a song by Sami Chokri. However, Sheeran has denied stealing the song. However, Sami Chokri, the singer of the song ""Shape of You,"" claimed that the song was similar to his own. The two singers settled in April 2017.<br>
Ed Sheeran's Shape of You was released on 1 January 2017. It has a global reach. It became the fastest selling male artist in the UK. The album spawned five hit singles. One of them, ""Shape of You,"" was declared the ninth best-selling song of all time by Billboard. Another hit, ""Castle on the Hill"", debuted at number six in the US and reached number four in the UK.</p>

<h2>Elton John's Candle in the Wind</h2><p>""Candle in the Wind"" was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin and became one of the most popular songs in the world. The song, which was a tribute to the late Princess Diana, is one of the most successful songs of all time. It's also one of the best-selling singles of all time, so it's important to note that it wasn't actually written for the Princess. The song's authors, John and Taupin, were inspired to write the song after reading the obituary of Janis Joplin.<br>
Elton John's career spans over five decades, and his greatest hits include ""Candle in the Wind"" and ""Candle in the Wind."" His popularity grew rapidly, with albums and singles selling more than 300 million copies worldwide. The singer also hosts his own music channel, Apple Music Show, where he hosts thoughtful conversations with rising and established artists and shares music from his extensive record collection.<br>
The Elton John version of ""Candle in the Wind"" was recorded in December 1986 at Sydney Entertainment Centre, Australia. The song was performed without a band and featured a keyboard effect that Elton controlled. The song was released in June 1987 as the second single from Elton John's album Live in Australia With the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The song was also included on the album ""Candle in the Wind"" (released in 1997).<br>
While the song had been one of Elton John's greatest hits, it wasn't always easy to get a hold of it. The song was recorded in Sydney, Australia, and stripped down to piano and synthesizers. Despite the fact that it was sung during the height of the AIDS epidemic, the song was still very popular and hit the top of the charts in the United States. One of the lyrics, ""Goodbye England's Rose,"" summed up the sadness and angst of that time.</p>

Coulda made this work<br>

But I guess I'm a letdown<br>
But it's cool, I checked out<br>
Oh, you wanna be friends now?<br>
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now<br>
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""Abcdario""]<br>
<br>
[Intro: Junior H]<br>
Desde que tú te fuiste puse el modo puto en ON<br>
Ya ni salir con morras guapas me trae emoción<br>
Me vi con una que parecía tu clon<br>
Muy bonito y todo, pero no había conexión<br>
<br>
[Coro: Edén Muñoz, <i>Junior H</i>, <b>Ambos</b>]<br>
Me acabé el abecedario, desde la A hasta la Z<br>
Y hasta repetí algunas letras<br>
Tú eras la oficial, yo era tu por mientras<br>
<i>Fui tu casi algo</i><br>
Chale, ando agüitado, todas son de paso<br>
Pa' que sean interesantes le doy fondo al vaso<br>
<b>Y si busco en Tinder en tu físico me baso</b><br>
<br>
[Verso 1: Edén Muñoz &amp; <i>Junior H</i>]<br>
Ser una mierda sе puso de moda no sé en qué momento<br>
Yo quеría ser bueno, pero morí en el intento<br>
En vez de arreglar corazones vo'a romperlos<br>
Quiero no tener sentimientos<br>
<i>No sé qué tengo<br>
Yo creo que ocupo un psicólogo o lentes pa' ver que tú no me quieres como yo<br>
Y agarrar el rollo y de paso mi dignidad<br>
Tú me conociste entero y me dejaste a la mitad</i><br>
<br>
[Coro: Edén Muñoz &amp; Junior H, <i>Edén Muñoz</i>]<br>
Me acabé el abecedario, desde la A hasta la Z<br>
Y hasta repetí algunas letras<br>
Tú eras la oficial, yo era tu por mientras<br>
<i>Fui tu casi algo<br>
Chale, ando agüitado, todas son de paso<br>
Pa' que sean interesantes le doy fondo al vaso</i><br>
Y si busco en Tinder en tu físico me baso<br>

México en la casa<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Junior H &amp; <i>Edén Muñoz</i>]<br>
Me tienes yendo a terapia y ni siquiera fuiste pa' pedir perdón<br>
Si mi vida es un desmadre, ya sabrás, mi corazón<br>
Desde que valió contigo yo me eché a la perdición<br>
Me eché a la perdición<br>
<i>Chale, yo ni las fotos he borrado<br>
Y tú ya traes nuevo ganado<br>
Pasa tips, porque eres experta olvidando<br>
Llama, please<br>
Qué hay que hacer, pa' irlo anotando</i><br>

<i>You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen<br>
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen<br>
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?</i><br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br>
Had a very shiny nose<br>
And if you ever saw it<br>
You would even say it glows<br>
All of the other reindeer<br>
Used to laugh and call him names<br>
They never let poor Rudolph<br>
Join in any reindeer games<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br>
Santa came to say<br>
""Rudolph with your nose so bright<br>
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""<br>
Then how the reindeer loved him<br>
As they shouted out with glee<br>
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br>
You'll go down in history<br>

Like a dream come alive, incredible<br>
A centerfold miracle, lyrical<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Constantly<br>
Boy, you play through my mind like a symphony<br>
There's no way to describe what you do to me<br>
You just do to me what you do<br>
And it feels like I've been rescued<br>
I've been set free<br>
I am hypnotized by your destiny<br>
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful, you are<br>

You stand alone to every record I own<br>

A song that goes on and on (And on)<br>

[Chorus]<br>
I, I love you like a love song, baby<br>

[Verse 1]<br>
I think about you on the road when I tear down the booth<br>
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you<br>
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute<br>
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot<br>
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you<br>
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do<br>
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth<br>
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue<br>

Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love<br>
Baby, all you really want is love<br>
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub<br>
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub (<i>Kdubb</i>)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me<br>
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually<br>
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy<br>
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me<br>
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me<br>
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster<br>

It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it<br>
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it<br>

"<p>To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever<br>
<br>
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture<br>
<br>
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like <a href=""/3906523/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs/Ice-t-and-nwa-were-not-only-ruling-rap-but-beginning-to-enter-the-mainstream-music-conversation"" data-id=""3906523"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation</a><br>
<br>
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""Drake - Gently ft. Bad Bunny (Traducción al Español)""]<br>
<br>
[Intro: Drake]<br>
Sí<br>
Mi G, Tití vino VIP con un rebaño<br>
Nena, mi muñeca es de Casablanco<br>
Me gusta su sonrisa aunque me haga daño<br>
Yo vivo como los Sopranos, Italianos<br>
He sido ""El Chico"" por 50 años<br>
Me gusta su culazo perreando<br>
Le da hasta abajo, le gusta este tamaño<br>
Dale, Papi Champaño, jheez<br>
Ah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh<br>
<br>
[Verso 1: Drake]<br>
O es reducir la velocidad al viaje o acelerar la visa<br>
Yo no quiero dejarte<br>
Agarro Eliza, a ella la traigo a Ibiza<br>
Te presento a Richie Akiva<br>
Mi hermanito Benito, él necesita a una bonita<br>
Una loca-ah, bien loquita<br>
Gracie Bon, mi amor, mi amiga<br>
Ella sabe que está bien rica<br>
<br>
[Puente: Bad Bunny]<br>
¿Usted se cree que yo quiero que me invierta mi dinero en la 42 donde la gente está bailando dembow?<br>
Ey, ja, ey, ey, ey<br>
Ay, santo, Dios mío, qué acicale<br>
En RD están to's mis cueros, en PR to'a las gyales<br>
Las mías se roban el show si sale<br>
To's quieren ser yo, pero no les sale<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]<br>
En Casa de Campo, chucky, en México ando bélico<br>
Baby, vo'a joderte el cosmético<br>
Trépate encima, ponme la skimask<br>
Bajen la luz y cierren la cortina<br>
Que no quiero video, estoy harto de la foto<br>
Estoy harto de to'l mundo, meno' de ese toto, de ese toto, je<br>
Meno' de ese toto, de ese toto, je, ey<br>
Botella de champaña yo las descorché<br>
Me puse bellaco cuando la escuché<br>
Decirme ""papi"" adentro 'e la Porsche<br>
Mierda, mami, santa mierda<br>
Qué rico tú chinga', je<br>
Las boris me piden bicho, las cubana' quieren pinga<br>
""Follame tan bien,"" me dice la gringa<br>
Mami, te pasaste, ey<br>

"<p>Who's debonair with the tall silk hat<br>
Muffler of wool and a tummy that's fat?<br>
King for the day and he loves the road<br>
With a broomstick cane and a heart of gold<br>
<br>
That's Frosty the Snowman<br>
He's a jolly happy soul<br>
With a corncob pipe and a button nose<br>
And two eyes made out of coal<br>
Frosty the snowman<br>
Is a fairytale they say<br>
He was made of snow<br>
But the children know<br>
How he came to life one day<br>
<br>
There must have been some magic<br>
In that old silk hat they found<br>
For when they placed it on his head<br>
He began to dance around<br>
<br>
Oh, Frosty the snowman<br>
Was alive as he could be<br>
And the children say<br>
He could laugh and play<br>
Just the same as you and me<br>
<br>
<i>Oh, Frosty the snowman<br>
Knew the sun was hot that day</i><br>
So he said, ""Let's run<br>
And we'll have some fun<br>
Now before I melt away""<br>
<i>So, down to the village<br>
With a broomstick in his hand</i><br>
Running here and there all around the square<br>
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""<br>
<br>
He led them down the streets of town<br>
Right to the traffic cop<br>
And he only paused a moment when<br>
He heard him holler ""Stop!""<br>
<br>
For Frosty the snowman<br>
Had to hurry on his way<br>
But he waved goodbye<br>
Saying, ""Don't you cry<br>
I'll be back again some day""<br>
<br>
<i>Hey, listen</i><br>
Thumpety thump thump<br>
Thumpety thump thump<br>
Look at Frosty go<br>
<i>Hey, look at him</i><br>
Thumpety thump thump<br>

"<p>[Round 1: Shotty Horroh]<br>
When I say ""long life"" you say, ""Pat Stay""<br>
Long Live<br>
(Pat Stay!)<br>
Long Live<br>
(Pat Stay!)<br>
Long Live<br>
(Pat Stay!)<br>
Some said I wasn't gonna-<br>
(Show up, that's what the talk was about<br>
But I show up to the showdown<br>
To show off when the show's on for all of the crowd!)<br>
Shuffle T<br>
Haha...fuckin' he<br>
""I like to talk about multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""<br>
You fuckin' geek<br>
Stay up for a couple weeks?<br>
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep<br>
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth<br>
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat<br>
Cause you got this humongous-<br>
Shuffle T<br>
Haha...fuckin' he<br>
""Oh I wrote the book on multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""<br>
You fuckin' geek<br>
You stay up for a couple weeks?<br>
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep<br>
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth<br>
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat<br>
Cause of this humongous heap of things that rhyme with ""wannabe""<br>
Tellin' Rowan you're not goin' to battle in some fuckin' club in Leeds<br>
On Don't Flop ""Hustlin' It Free"" cause you got an upcoming book release<br>
And I congratulated him like, ""You wrote a book? What an amazing guy.""<br>
When you hear he wrote a book your thoughts go to some of our greatest minds<br>
I said, ""What's your book about? Space and time?<br>
Ancient tribes?<br>
The economic crisis as we sit back and watch inflation rise<br>
No, no, no, it's a novel, something more on the creative vibe<br>
No, conspiracy theories<br>
Children of <i>The Matrix</i> vibe<br>
David Icke<br>
Please, tell me the subject you're takin' with this publication, cause I cannot take the hype<br>
He looked me dead in the face, and right<br>
He said, ""I wrote a book about complicated rhymes.""<br>
""Complicated rhymes?!""<br>
""Yeah. Multisyllabics<br>
They absolutely have to be done when you rap to the punch of it like<br>
Plus the grammatical structure and pattern needs a straight function and fashion<br>
But I'll allow for slight discrepancies depending on the native tongue of the accent but that does come with an asterisks<br>
And...you know...you know...who needs to kiss a girl?<br>
That's stuff just a distraction, I don't need direct sunlight or a shower. None of it<br>
Why would I go to a club and get plastered<br>
When I can stay at home, figure out the number of attractors<br>
And sift through my rejection emails to see if the publishers haven't told me I need to- told me I need to be fuckin' embarrassed?""<br>
I'm joking<br>
He's kissed a girl before<br>
Have you kissed a girl before?<br>
He's kissed a girl before<br>
In fact, Shuffle and his ex just finalized a fuckin' divorce<br>
Bitch wrote the man a rhyme for Valentines and he told her her multi's were forced<br>
The man even pointed a score<br>
Give her just under a four<br>
She laughed it off<br>
""Oh my Adam it's funny for sure.""<br>
But he said she should've known better she did something he just couldn't ignore<br>
Especially now he's booked in the store so he doesn't love her no more<br>
Fuckin' run for the door<br>
Fuckin' guy<br>
Awkward as fuck, walkin' like he's got a wooden spine<br>
Doesn't let you sing ""Happy Birthday"" to him because it doesn't rhyme<br>
Wore his weird fuckin' trench coat a 100 times<br>
Got you lookin' like you come disguised<br>
As a cunt that likes the under 5's<br>
Nonce!<br>
Wore it so many times he doesn't need to hang up his coat<br>
He hasn't washed it in years<br>
He takes it off and it stands on it's own<br>
That coat is alive<br>
It's symbiosis<br>
It demands the controls when attached to a host<br>
I saw him put his hand inside said jacket, and it actually moaned<br>
""Oooh yeah.""<br>
""Oooh ye-""<br>
Either it's been the same jacket for 10 years or you got ten on a rack on a special stack like <i>Dexter's Lab</i><br>
Each of 'em have a tiny pocket which contains a microscopic list of all the sex you've had<br>
That coat screams, ""Why does she never text me back?""<br>
So dirty every time he wears it his neck gets chapped and his flesh is cracked with a reddish rash<br>
I gave him a hook last week and my leg was scratched<br>
I had to get a [?]<br>
Fuck that coat!<br>
I've never known anything to smell as bad, it gets me mad<br>
When I see it, it makes me wanna Jet like a Pepsi ad for collecting cans<br>
That one's for the Netflix fans, you get me gang?<br>
Baow!<br>
That's my first round in, safe star blessed<br>
I've got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left!<br>
<br>
[Round 1: Shuffle T]<br>
Everybody’s been, telling me I won’t ever survive my next foe<br>
I was never alive, been sentenced to life, they sent me to fry at death row<br>
They’ve already supplied some fresh clothes, the burial site, the headstone<br>
I’m dead on arrival, end of the line, but ready to die, so let’s go!<br>
That’s why I’ve drafted a will…<br>
Now I'd like <i>Sounds Like</i> to continue so I leave the registered rights to Pedro<br>
And I want Big J to finally get that sexy, designer trench coat<br>
And to Soul I leave my engraved piece of Jefferson Price’s bedpost<br>
And a really, really, really long collection of rhymes for <i>Death Note</i><br>
Because I’m battling Shotty Horroh – yeah?<br>
The genius<br>
I mean it<br>
In Manchester, this guy is Jesus<br>
I am in utter shock, I'm giddy – in pieces<br>
Underprepared best man...I’m speechless<br>
They said, ""Shotty’s back to battling, it’s just like the olden days.""<br>
Couldn’t believe it “God’s back, huh? Holy shoulder blades”<br>
Well fuck it I’m back, too<br>
What’s up Premier Battles? You already know the dizzle<br>
Been underground, now Shuff's back in town, lock up your daughters; Josef Fritzl<br>
But this battle was meant to be last April, honestly<br>
He called it off… I’m like, ""What? But mate, you promised me.""<br>
I asked if it’s still happening, he’s like “Maybe. Possibly”<br>
I’ve been patiently waiting for this ancient prophesy<br>
Too pussy to actually face me properly<br>
He’s pissing himself worried that he’ll take a loss to me (colostomy)<br>
It’s taken you three prime ministers and a change of monarchy<br>
Do you understand how many lines I wrote that are now outdated due to your attitude?<br>
Do you understand how many Will Smith/Chris Rock punchlines I had to scrap for you?!<br>
And organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate<br>
It smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday<br>
We’re having this clash judged too, by performers he would have to know<br>
Because they rap for, YOUR platform – this sports arena that you own<br>
I can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go<br>
This is about as unbiased as Kim Jong Un in a North Korean Talent show<br>
I’ve also seen your battles though – I’ve got you figured out: 'Roids<br>
Simmer down, mate, you should be chilling out, poised<br>
Think about it all he has is a loud voice<br>
But your writing’s more of a shits how than <i>Mrs. Brown’s Boys</i><br>
You hit mid-thirties and went up about six dress sizes<br>
You are a limping, groaning, knuckle-dragging midlife crisis<br>
I don’t care who’s most popular, I care about who’s the nicest<br>
You have a bigger name than me? So does fucking Isis<br>
Now, I preferred you when you were off the 'roids and thin<br>
But now he’s addicted to working out and it’s poisoned him<br>
You on social media is an extremely annoying thing<br>
My whole Twitter feed is you and Cojay just agreeing you enjoy the gym<br>
I want the stick person that we’ve seen, this version baffles me<br>
Wants to wrestle now? Well, I doubt we’ll see a big surge in casualties<br>
Such a fake guy he’ll only fake fight, he’ll inverse to atrophy<br>
Want to wrestle so bad? Go wrestle with your split personality<br>
I’m praying and I am hoping that by the end of this his head is fixed<br>
I’m talking to him, since it’s clear a therapist never did<br>
Cause you on social media is nuts<br>
I mean, you’ve got this anger that brews<br>
There’s different versions of him, these doppelgängers you use<br>
Someone says something you don’t like? He’s gotten mad in a mood<br>
Now, Shotty’s back in the room, you’re not the Adam we knew<br>
This constant angst is problematic, what’s the matter? Drop the act<br>
This rotten apple’s, gotten bad, he’s lost and tangled, shocking tact, you’re not a man you’re a youth<br>
That’s not what adults should do<br>
Acting like everyone’s against him, what an arrogant view<br>
Like you’re the center of attention? Your logic has to improve<br>
Not everybody’s a snake, a shocking fact, but it’s true<br>
When you fall out with everyone then the common factor is you<br>
You fuck up relationships the moment you activate a computer<br>
Turning friends you keep into enemies and those actions make you a user<br>
Think St. Patrick's Day, I banish snakes, I am the saint of the future<br>
I keep ahead (a head) of serpents like Perseus decapitating Medusa<br>
So don’t let his bullshit blur your vision<br>
Don’t be intimidated by a word he’s written<br>
Cause what he writes isn’t true like tabloid journalism<br>
So don’t be scared, most Horroh’s (horror) stories are a work of fiction<br>
<br>
[Round 2: Shotty Horroh]<br>
He's alright, isn't he?<br>
Probably someone with a case for the top 4<br>
Not many can joke as good as him<br>
You normally know I'm goin' to win<br>
But today...you aren't sure<br>
That's fine<br>
Bastards<br>
He's a formidable opponent<br>
You're just livin' in the moment<br>
That graveyard's been nothin' but rusty chains and locked doors<br>
Until Brizzy said, ""Look Shuffle over"", well then I made space for one more<br>
The most, one dimensional rapper in the scene<br>
For the last ten years he's given us nothin' fresh<br>
Just copies Ricky Gervais' whole shit and makes it rhyme...I'm unimpressed<br>
I don't need to watch a Shuffle battle to tell you what could've happened, it's formulaic, I could've guessed<br>
Funny how you're called ""Shuffle"" when we always know what's comin' next<br>
I catch Shuffle while he teaches his little Rhyme &amp; Rap Beginner classes<br>
Slidin' past the guy who asked for ticket passes<br>
With a knife that's stashed within my jacket<br>
Slicin', drive the jagged shiv I fashioned inside his ab, his liver's splashed<br>
Drive it back<br>
The skin is rugged like the shank it's gettin' traction<br>
You was battlin' bowls of fuckin' Fanta<br>
They kinda clash as mirror matches<br>
Cause you're both full of gas<br>
And the thumb and index is somethin' I can actually twist ya cap with<br>
Try me, try me, try me<br>
Act as if I'm chattin', don't die for rap cause it's in fashion<br>
They wanted Shuffle in the graveyard<br>
Now it's time for Michael Jackson 'Thriller' dances<br>
I heard, ""Shuffle's outside""<br>
Let's get this Muppet outlined<br>
I don't give a fuck about rhymes<br>
I got this <b>gun</b> from 'round mines<br>
Me and my cousin, downsized<br>
It's just us and a brown ride [?]<br>
Foot in his house like, ""Give it up or your pal dies.""<br>
And Marlo stood there like, like, ""I don't mean to trouble you now guys<br>
But I've got lunch at about 5:00 and another function around 9:00<br>
I'm just worried about time<br>
Gun butt him<br>
Outlines<br>
Blood comin' out his mouth like you asked Gunna about slime<br>
Aim at Shuffle, and Shuffle outcries<br>
""Are you guys gonna fuckin' shoot me?!""<br>
{gun cocks}<br>
What does it sound like?<br>
And Marlo stood there...joke<br>
Fuck that! I'm outrageous<br>
If I don't impress Shuffle, I press Shuffle without playlist<br>
I'm the sensei<br>
What's a sensation to an out station<br>
Where would you have gotten without favors? Let's talk foundations<br>
There's a difference between rock bottom and ground breakers<br>
If I would've showed up today without patience, you'd be an outpatient<br>
Ahh<br>
Mortician, Shuffle on the table without Vegas<br>
I am thee, without a doubt greatest<br>
Out of town blazin', an ounce [?]<br>
You're just me, without flavor<br>
Downgraded, outdated<br>
Shotty, Tony, Soul, Kruger, Bizzo, Bobby, Unan', you're about 8ish<br>
Wait, that's without Arkaic, I can't downplay him<br>
Fuck Shuffle T!<br>
I've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements<br>
DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers<br>
You rhyme words together really well<br>
That's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle<br>
That's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle<br>
That's where you seem to struggle<br>
You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle<br>
YOU let him do this with no conviction<br>
Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble<br>
He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle<br>
That's why we don't believe in ya<br>
So many elite MC's that leagues above ya<br>
We don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle<br>
You get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part<br>
I told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card<br>
You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code<br>
Like it's an invincible spell<br>
He thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L<br>
All that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be<br>
If you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well<br>
I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself<br>
Second round in, safe star bless<br>
Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left<br>
<br>
[Round 2: Shuffle T]<br>
<br>
{Shuffle pulls out his phone}<br>
<br>
""Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR?<br>
Yeah it's to deal with well-being and safeguards<br>
2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card<br>
My place of work is Shotty Horroh’s Graveyard<br>
My complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start<br>
I just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar<br>
And I think he’s in denial cause, I know where the graves are<br>
And he always saying that he isn't, but he is running out of space fast<br>
If we ask too many questions he forces us out<br>
He turns up some days and orders us 'round<br>
He was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now<br>
Some are saying he won’t show up<br>
That’s what people are saying<br>
It's a hassle, it's a stress, it's havoc, it's a mess<br>
I just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express<br>
And if I ask how they died that’s a sackable offence<br>
Am I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death?<br>
I’m calling today cause I’ve just had someone through, Tali<br>
Another hopeless victim<br>
And I’m looking around and I’ve got no idea for the life of me where I’m s’posed to fit him<br>
Plot 3?<br>
No that’s taken. It’s taken it don’t need filling<br>
Well, I can put Tali in there but he’s going to have Tony with him<br>
I get that these things are best handled with stealth<br>
It’s just - it’s extra stress for me, which is bad for my health<br>
But I guess I’ve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt<br>
What was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help.""<br>
Listen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying<br>
When he does smile, his Face ID doesn’t recognize him<br>
That, and you've put on a [?] amount of weight<br>
A bit of padding around the face<br>
You're the man of the house, it's great<br>
I bet your calorie count's insane<br>
But I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised<br>
I don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape<br>
Now, he DID beat me in that film <i>VS</i> – but it was hard for me to lose that<br>
Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, “We can’t really use that<br>
It needs to be WORSE than Shotty’s material, so can you write us a new rap?”<br>
I said, “WORSE than Shotty’s stuff…? I don’t know if I can do that.”<br>
In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts<br>
To make my stuff as bad as what’s coming out that fucking mouth of his<br>
At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit<br>
The director said, “I think we’ll need to dumb it down a bit.”<br>
I was in <i>8 Mile</i> as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck<br>
Producer called me personally said, “We need you for this, Shuff”<br>
I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut<br>
Apparently, me getting beat wasn’t “believable enough”<br>
Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey<br>
Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry<br>
But it’s an understatement if you're describing me as ‘hungry’<br>
That’s like calling Ian Huntley a ‘cheeky monkey’<br>
I feel so comfy up here, I’m winning this in every round<br>
I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown<br>
You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh<br>
We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half<br>
Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you<br>
The second that a battle’s not inside of the M62<br>
I could’ve had this battle in your house in your parent’s living room<br>
And have them both arguing over who they’d give it to<br>
Your mom gives it to me<br>
So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space<br>
Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate’s rates<br>
I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay<br>
I don’t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today<br>
Don’t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win’s clear on stage<br>
I just don’t care about the teams, cause I’m not 6 years of age<br>
Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million<br>
I am my own worst critic and I think I’m fucking brilliant!<br>
So fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle<br>
Let’s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word ‘shuffle’<br>
Time<br>
<br>
[Round 3: Shotty Horroh]<br>
I mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck<br>
I've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them<br>
As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them<br>
But there's this Joe Pesci notion...<br>
Funny how? If you focusin'<br>
Cause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em<br>
Cause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin'<br>
But you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him<br>
Cause I don't fuck my friends over<br>
You get bad luck from it<br>
Pussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic<br>
Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever<br>
He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure<br>
He's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better<br>
Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together<br>
He does not give a fuck<br>
I've never met anybody as bold as he is<br>
Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the <i>Sound Like</i> show that evenin'?<br>
And he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings<br>
He sat there like, ""What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating<br>
Boys I have Ronan Keating.""<br>
He does not give a fuck, you have to understand<br>
That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys<br>
Without them, I don't think the scene you see today exists<br>
I'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down<br>
I'm just sayin', you ain't legit<br>
Cause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this<br>
Loyal to the soil<br>
I don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz<br>
You don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit<br>
That's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this<br>
Cause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it<br>
And I'm the guy that pays you it<br>
And I did your little panel show for free twice<br>
It was COVID times I let the love persuade me<br>
You couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy<br>
You came at me with the whole ""we're friends"" angle and I [?]<br>
Cause me charging Shuffle shady<br>
Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was ""fuck you pay me""<br>
So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class<br>
These posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps<br>
And wanna turn it into data and a [?]<br>
""Click this link and learn how to be hip hop""<br>
FUCK OFF!<br>
We ain't got the patience for all a dat<br>
For your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed<br>
I didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book<br>
I was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps<br>
People hated, FUCK THAT<br>
I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank<br>
Me versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match<br>
Cause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut<br>
Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious<br>
It's not a joke<br>
Cause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks<br>
It's one of those<br>
Why do your arms look so heavy bro?<br>
I gotta know<br>
You look like every single [?] trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home<br>
Fuckin' strange guy<br>
Lookin' like the little <i>Men In Black</i> alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time<br>
And thank you very much<br>
Another straight, white, male with a podcast<br>
With long hair and edgy jokes<br>
It's fuckin' Russel off-Brand<br>
<br>
That's me, thank you<br>
<br>
[Round 3: Shuffle T]<br>
Now your music has actually been a little different lately<br>
When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady<br>
That <i>Scum Of The Earth</i> album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy<br>
I said, “Do you think you might have ripped them off a bit?” He said “mayyyyyybeeeeeeee!""<br>
I said, “Yeah, <i>Definitely Maybe</i><br>
Here’s what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little'<br>
Then you just 'Roll With It'<br>
Head up in the clouds<br>
I mean he doesn’t hear it<br>
It makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about<br>
No one’s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound<br>
In fact, I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
'Don't Look Back In Anger'<br>
You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock<br>
Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, it’s not<br>
You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully<br>
But musically, now you’re nowhere near as good as it used to be<br>
Cause when you sell out your art for a dime<br>
It’ll never be far from your mind<br>
Cause when you’ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb<br>
You’re energy starved and you’ll try, but never regrasp on those heights<br>
Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines<br>
And everything’s harder to rhyme<br>
Integrity’s hard to define<br>
But when you pretend to be part of a life<br>
Of the celebrity’s art that you like<br>
All you’re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime<br>
So, all you’ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise<br>
That’s why you’re running out of smoke like a contestant on <i>Stars In Their Eyes</i><br>
Tonight Matthew, I’m going to shove Noel’s Gallagher’s dick in every hole that it can fit<br>
The only role that you can give, this ain’t a cold slap on the wrist<br>
You’re facing the whole character list of <i>Soul Caliber 6</i><br>
That’s why he’s saying shit lines these days like<br>
""It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets"", oh my God, you're such a prick<br>
The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn’t fuck with it<br>
I was just watching with a confused face, I couldn’t keep up with it<br>
Not because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit<br>
""Italian blood running the streets"" – I’ll slow down I’m out maneuvering<br>
I'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring<br>
See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym<br>
I don’t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him<br>
Let me say something simple and make it official<br>
Battle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle<br>
Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme<br>
You make it sound complex but it’s always just the same obnoxious theme<br>
People used to be able to battle in a way they’d want to speak<br>
Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean?<br>
Every line it’s “I said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?”<br>
I’m just watching from the side like “Mate. It isn’t that clever.”<br>
So, I won’t dress this up with word play I’ll just tell you what the truth is<br>
I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit<br>
Your battles aren’t that great these days, neither is your music<br>
I think you’re overrated, and I think you’re fuckin' stupid<br>
This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent<br>
You make something simple feel like rocket science<br>
I make rocket science feel like comic timing<br>
Like Hugh Laurie, <i>The Two Ronnies</i> or <i>Monty Python</i><br>
It doesn’t make an ounce of difference how you spin it<br>
Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted<br>
I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness<br>
This counterfeited coward’s limits<br>
There’s always praise for you and you’re showered with it<br>
Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit<br>
They put you in the top 4 they’ve mapped out your image<br>
Well, you can have Mount Rushmore I’ll take Mount Olympus<br>
You say I’m a clown as if it means that I’m annoyed<br>
I love that reputation, that's my pride and joy<br>
So, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy!<br>
Take that belt to its biting point<br>
I’ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you’ll have a higher voice than a choirboy’s!<br>
If you’re watching from overseas – watch more UK battle rap<br>
Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It’s action packed<br>
Watch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq<br>
Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat!<br>
See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle’s what I make it<br>
You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips<br>
You’re an imitator – you see what’s out there and you claim it<br>
I’m an innovator – I see what’s out there and I change it<br>

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire<br>
Jack frost nipping at your nose<br>
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir<br>
And folks dressed up like Eskimos<br>
<br>
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe<br>
Help to make the season bright<br>
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow<br>
Will find it hard to sleep tonight<br>
<br>
They know that Santa's on his way<br>
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh<br>
And every mother's child is gonna spy<br>
To see if reindeers really know how to fly<br>
<br>
And so I'm offering this simple phrase<br>
To kids from one to ninety-two<br>
Although its been said many times<br>
Many ways, merry Christmas to you<br>

Somos dos personas que conectan con la mente<br>
<i>En una te llamo, en dos voy llegando<br>
En tres nos besamos y en cuatro te pongo el saldo<br>
Para que me marques, quiero tu llamada<br>
Para estar juntitos todo este fin de semana</i><br>

"<p>[Letra de ""X SI VOLVEMOS""]<br>
<br>
[Intro: KAROL G]<br>
No funcionamos (No funcionamos)<br>
Lo dimos todo, pero no se nos dio (No)<br>
Por eso nos vamos (Nos vamos)<br>
Pero antes de irnos<br>
<br>
[Coro: KAROL G]<br>
Vamo' a hacerlo por última vez, bebé (Bebé)<br>
Que en el amor no, pero en la cama nos entendemos (Oh)<br>
Es una porno, a mí me encanta cómo lo hacemos<br>
No borraré tu contacto y estoy al tanto por si volvemos<br>
(Pero así no; ey)<br>
<br>
[Verso 1: KAROL G]<br>
Por la orillita, se me cuida (Ey)<br>
Pero llama cuando quiere que te deje la cama destendida<br>
Los bellaqueo' no se olvidan (No se olvidan; ey)<br>
A nadie de confianza se le niega un polvo de despedida, ey<br>
Yo estoy puesta pa'l repeat (Repeat)<br>
Tú pon la cama, que yo pongo el krippy (Krippy)<br>
Para varear, en la playa en RD, Punta Cana (Ah, ah)<br>
En la ventana mirando la city<br>
<br>
[Puente: KAROL G]<br>
Ya sé que en el amor somo' un desastre (-tre)<br>
Yo soy bandida, y tú ere' gánster<br>
No sé cuánto tiempo malgastaste<br>
Intentando algo serio<br>
Ya sé que no soy lo que pensaste (Eh-eh)<br>
Pero desde que me besaste<br>
Con mi malicia te enviciaste<br>
(Esto no es saludable, pero)<br>
<br>
[Coro: KAROL G &amp; <i>Romeo Santos</i>]<br>
Vamo' a hacerlo por última vez, <i>bebé</i> (<i>Bebé</i>)<br>

<i>No he borrado tu contacto y estoy al tanto por si volvemos</i><br>
(<i>Pero así no</i>)<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Romeo Santos]<br>
Nuestro amor 'tá jodío'<br>
Pero qué sensación cuando en la cama se acaban los líos<br>
¿Será que el sexo contigo es mi adicción?<br>
Amores tóxicos solo sirven pa' <a href=""/30375464/Karol-g-and-romeo-santos-x-si-volvemos/Sin"" data-id=""30375464"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">sin—</a><br>
Somos tan explícitos, pero llegó a su fin (So nasty)<br>
Despídete desnuda, con mi cel te voy grabando<br>
Yo te digo adiós dentro de ti<br>
Guarda este vídeo para cuando te haga falta<br>
Y estés moja'íta pensando en mí<br>
<br>
[Coro: KAROL G &amp; <i>Romeo Santos</i>, <b>Ambos</b>]<br>

<i>No he borrado tu contacto y estoy al tanto por si volvemos</i><br>

O holy night<br>
The stars are brightly shining<br>
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth<br>
Long lay the world<br>
In sin and error pining<br>
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
A thrill of hope<br>
The weary world rejoices<br>
For yonder breaks<br>
A new and glorious morn<br>
Fall on your knees<br>
O hear the angels' voices<br>
O night divine<br>
O night when Christ was born<br>
O night divine<br>
O night<br>
O night divine<br>

[Chorus]<br>
A thrill of hope<br>
The weary world rejoices<br>

O night when Christ was born<br>
O night divine<br>
O night divine (O night divine)<br>
Ooh, yes it was (O night divine)<br>
Oh, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth (O night divine)<br>
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah<br>

"<p>[Verse 1: Becky G &amp; Leonardo Aguilar]<br>
I'm supposed to have already forgotten you, that ours already rest in peace<br>
Tell me what I do here in my solitude thinking about how you are<br>
Tell me if there's another mouth that kisses you, if I'm still in your head<br>
I want to know if with another tattoo you covered my name with another name<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Becky G &amp; Ángela Aguilar]<br>
I, on the contrary, almost lost my soul<br>
So I don't feel your goodbye that disarms me<br>
I tried to negotiate it with karma<br>
And he told me: ""Everything is paid, everything is paid""<br>
I, on the contrary, almost sold the soul<br>
In exchange for living without feeling anything<br>
And I know it shows in my eyes<br>
That your memories mistreat, but they don't kill me<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Becky G, Ángela Aguilar &amp; Leonardo Aguilar]<br>
I wanted to talk to karma and ask him to let me forget his face<br>
That he would forgive m<br>
Because I feel like you're aiming, but you don't see<br>
I cry to God: ""Why will you forsake me?""<br>
Sometimes I lie to see if I feel like I can breathe without you<br>
But you know it's not like that, you're fine without me<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Ángela Aguilar &amp; Becky G]<br>
I, on the contrary, almost lost my soul<br>
For not feeling your goodbye that disarms me<br>
I tried to negotiate it with karma<br>
He told me: ""Everything is paid, everything is paid""<br>
I, on the contrary, almost sold the soul<br>
In exchange for living without feeling anything<br>
And I know it shows in my eyes<br>
That your memories mistreat, but they still don't kill me<br>

"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?<br>
In the lane, snow is glistening<br>
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight<br>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br>
Gone astray is the bluebird<br>
Here to stay is a new bird<br>
He sings a love song as we go along<br>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br>

In the meadow, we can build a snowman<br>
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown<br>

We'll say, ""No, man<br>
But you can do the job<br>
When you're in town""<br>

As we dream by the fire<br>
To face unafraid the plans that we've made<br>

Though your nose gets a chilling<br>

Aquí andamos con mis amigos de la adictiva<br>
Vamos a aventar un corrido bélico, plebe<br>
<i>Claro que sí, Compa Luis R Conriquez<br>
Pa' que se pongan a vaciar botes, viejones<br>
¡Qué se arme mi raza!<br>
¡Salucita 'e la buena, mi raza, muchacho'!</i> (Ai)<br>
<i>¡Así suena esto, compadre, ánimo!<br>
¡Y así suena La Adictiva de Mesillas!<br>
Con el compa Luis R Conriquez, viejo</i><br>
<br>
[Verso 1:  <i>La Adictiva</i> &amp; Luis R Conriquez]<br>
<i>Se le extraña demasiado al general en la capital del corrido<br>
La capital es Culiacán y no está sola porque aquí siguen sus hijos<br>
Es el jefe, lo es y lo era<br>
Gira y se para la tiеrra si Joaquín lo ordena</i><br>
<br>
Un viernes mе pararon en mi carro porque andaba velozmente<br>
Nos dijeron ""Aquí andamos patrullando 24-7<br>
No se asusten si miran retenes<br>
Y menos si cargan las gorras de JGL<br>

<i>Los menores ya se volvieron mayores y lo que les sobra es gente<br>
En esta vida no viene con instrucciones ni te enseña a ser jefe<br>
Uno es bravo y el otro es más<br>
Son dos hermanos, uno es Alfredo y el otro es Iván</i><br>
<br>
Del Culiacanazo no les hablaremos porque no está permitido<br>
Ese día no lo pintaron de rojo porque soltaron al hijo<br>
De la montaña llegan los cheques<br>
Y todos vienen firmados por JGL<br>
<br>
<i>Fue en La Gran Manzana donde el mundo presenció el juicio del siglo</i><br>
Al 701 allá en la sierra lo recuerdan con cariño<br>
Aquí manda el señor de La Tuna<br>
Así el Chapo esté en Culiacán, Nueva York o la luna<br>

Volver a besar tu frente<br>
Tal vez en otra galaxia sí fue diferente<br>
Tal vez ahí sí se nos dio lo que quisimos siempre, eh<br>

"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow<br>
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow<br>
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow<br>
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
That if I can't be close to you<br>
I'll settle for the ghost of you<br>
I miss you more than life (More than life)<br>
And if you can't be next to me<br>
Your memory is ecstasy<br>
I miss you more than life<br>
I miss you more than life<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow<br>
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed<br>
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow<br>
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
That if I can't be close to you<br>
I'll settle for the ghost of you<br>
I miss you more than life (Yeah)<br>

Your memory is ecstasy (Oh)<br>

That you don't need not a man, and you can stand on your own<br>
Let's keep stacking your bread and one day, we gon' get gone<br>
And get away from here<br>
You're the only reason I be staying here</a><br>
Wanna paint a picture, let's make it clear<br>

[Verse 1: gamemast15r]<br>
Paranoia haunts me<br>
I look behind my back every second for anything that's off key<br>
I’m grateful for the dead<br>
I’m grateful for anything that goes to make me bread<br>
My skin bulletproof, fuck upstate, I'm going down into the dirt<br>
With my tre pound causing the hurt, stalking to murk<br>
Hallelujah, Fidel Castro knocking on death's door<br>
Nine Inch Nails in your forehead like Trent Reznor<br>
Crucifixes, the juice is written in the Ghetto Quran<br>
The metal will spawn, hollow tips that fit in your palm<br>

[Verse 2: I_need_2_die]<br>
From Columbus, I ain’t scared and I’m infamous<br>
There’s a reason why everyone see my wickedness<br>
Broke into houses and sold a couple of grams<br>
I ain’t telling a story like I’m Big Baby D.R.A.M<br>
Crack houses downtown while wannabe gangsters in the burbs<br>
They look like clowns and they get there ass beat on the curb<br>
I got anxiety so I guess I’m like Cudi<br>
There isn’t anyone I know that’s like Buddy<br>
Holly told me she’d date me but I know she been sucking dick<br>
But goddamn, the way she looked, made me harder than a brick<br>
Food stamps and welfare doesn’t help that much<br>
So I gotta save the day like a CS GO clutch<br>
Feelin like Cassius with a lot of stings<br>
I hate attention so fuck the bling<br>
Fuck your high horse, Ima ride a giraffe<br>
Your voice is hoarse, makes me wanna laugh<br>
I ain’t a Nixon, I make stories like Dickens<br>
Listening to me is like reading a book<br>
Fuck Rihanna and make that ass twerk<br>
Y'all sucker MC’s know I can’t be shook<br>
DMX made the devil his bitch and made him cook<br>
That’s how I got some spicy sriracha shrimp<br>
I ain’t king, the liberals call me Raja Pimp<br>
Gunshots got me levitated<br>
They’re always unpremeditated<br>
Kanye got me feeling creative<br>
Oops, I mean breative<br>
Don’t wanna be looked at the wrong way<br>
I told shawty I ain’t got the answers like Sway<br>
She left me and I got a new bae<br>
It’s a brand new day with brand new faces<br>
Not that good at rhymes but I know I killed it like Jason<br>

Im sick and tired of yall asking<br>
Whos the greatest MC<br>

Its such a misdemeanor<br>
How yall abusing the craft that I love<br>

You can love, embrace, or hate me<br>
But you will respect me<br>

Flow hot, known that I smoke pot<br>
All night, 'til I move like a robot<br>
Programmed to smoke grams and throw shots<br>
Back man, you understand? I'm on top<br>
Green light, I'm lightin' the green. No stop<br>
Spit lightening right when the beat drops<br>
No kidding, I'm living in rack city<br>
I'm 'bout to relapse, you can run from it or fuck with me<br>
I'm coming to gun anyone dumb enough to tempt me<br>
I see you sweating, come get me<br>
I'm ready, don't disrespect me<br>
I'm feeling heavy and stepping on enemies who resent me<br>
I'm sending a message<br>
You can respect it or get infected<br>
I'm guessing you've never been in a rapping Russian Roulette<br>
Who's next?  Is the question<br>
You laying next to me dead<br>
I'm sexting your girl, next day she sending texts to her friends:<br>
""Oh my God have you met him?<br>

[Verse 9: Meach the Heir]<br>
There’s a stench in the air…<br>
I can smell fear<br>
Caution tape all ‘cross the state<br>
Guess someone must’ve fell near<br>
Hop the gate tryna solve the case<br>
Should’ve rolled deep like Adeles there<br>
For now just concentrate, Buried on the base<br>
Is a nigga in a suit not geoffrey from bel air<br>
<br>
Just search the dirt unearth the worst<br>
The corpse of the first<br>
Scorched from the words<br>
Returned for junior – the kennedy curse<br>
<br>
You can’t catch this<br>
Don’t leave a clue for forensics<br>
No one in red white and blue to avenge it<br>
Enter my spot and<br>
I’m sending off shots!<br>
Offending? You not!<br>
Just pretending you hot<br>
Tryna skip school with a fake ass fever<br>
You can’t act like the cypher needs ya<br>
Snakes on a plane don’t let the vipers eat up<br>
Heimlich procedure when my rap precedes a<br>
Rappers feature, its raptor season when Meach packs the ether<br>
<br>
They lacking<br>
Cause ain’t no such things as Halfway Savage<br>
Either you take a seat or take action You spazzin<br>
Cause ain’t no such things as Halfway Savage<br>
Take a seat or take action<br>
I destroy the snares and bass like acid<br>
You plastic, getting stretched like elastic<br>
Reaching for my standards, you spazzin<br>

[Verse 10: Hoshi]<br>
Sitting on the rooftop, don't need to have no proof that<br>
I represent you no matter where your hood's at<br>
Some call me Hoshi, some call me Gbtalentx<br>
More original than the rest<br>
On the forums I'm yelling ""Free YDB""<br>
On Earth I was yelling ""Vote Honey G""<br>
Back on a verse, I ain't got a reason<br>
But you all this year is Hoshi Season<br>

[Verse 11: Corduroy Crook]<br>
This season wack rappers getting wrapped in plastic<br>
First birthed gun and bet this steel is dynastic<br>
Imperial how I'm empirically better than most<br>
Live from the east coast<br>
You already know this a classic<br>
The games been mastered so now they plaster and package it<br>
Call it remastered and sell it back to the youth<br>
I'm literally baffled at how they trick all these bastards<br>
Decimate a culture for the loot<br>
Now I'm screaming<br>
Gimme gimme<br>
Rap like I handle a semi<br>
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me<br>
Or you<br>
And for your sake they ain't no saving grace<br>
I'm new york nigga<br>
It was written that we was great<br>
Running, ducking in the bx I read it in the cement<br>
Spent some time in the Vern then I knew I'd be next<br>
Now there's no way out<br>
Less I'm going south bending corners<br>
Ride up on ya<br>
Grip the tool<br>
The punishment is capital<br>
Soon as I clear his chest<br>
Figure how I'm movin next<br>
Studying blueprints<br>
Wonder how the fuck I'm gonna get to x<br>
Stressing how to get the check<br>
Big chains?  Fame? Critical acclaim?<br>
Man, I don't bother with games<br>
When we talking about change<br>
Two coins start the chain<br>
To million dollars of change<br>
Seems right when I'm on the mic<br>
That I recognize greats<br>
You outta town acts<br>
Better go back and check the names</p>

Happiness and cheer<br>
Fun for all that children call<br>
Their favorite time of the year<br>
Snowflakes in the air<br>
Carols everywhere<br>
Olden times and ancient rhymes<br>
Of love and dreams to share<br>
Sleigh bells in the air<br>
Beauty everywhere<br>
Yuletide by the fireside<br>
And joyful memories there<br>
Christmas time is here<br>
Families drawing near<br>
Oh, that we could always see<br>
Such spirit through the year</p>

¿Lo ves? Así<br>
A este ritmo no puedo seguir<br>
Ya no sé qué más hacer<br>
Para obtener más de ti<br>
¿Por qué no quieres cuando yo quiero?<br>
Estás más frío que el mes de enero<br>
Pido calor y no das más que hielo, oh, oh<br>
<br>
[Coro: Shakira]<br>
Hace rato tengo sed de ti, yo no sé por qué<br>
Quedo con ganas de más y queriendo beber de una copa vacía<br>
Hace rato tengo sed de ti, yo no sé por qué<br>
Quedo con ganas de más y queriendo beber de una copa vacía, ah, ah, ah<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Shakira]<br>
Siempre estás ocupado con tanto negocio<br>
Te haría bien, mi amor, un poquito de ocio<br>
Relájate aquí, en el sofá, y dame tu atención<br>
Oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
No hay que ser poeta pa' endulzarme el oído<br>
Suelta el teléfono, usa tu mano conmigo<br>
Sé que estás bueno, pero mucho más buena estoy yo<br>
Oh<br>

Como si no sintiera nada<br>
Ahora me miras tan diferente<br>
Y yo nadando en contra 'e la corriente<br>
Me tiene en la calle buscando<br>
Con qué llenar este vacío que se siente<br>
Yo no soy mecánico, pero trato de arreglarlo y no funciona<br>
Reanimando un corazón que no reacciona<br>
No quiero intentarlo <i>con otra persona</i><br>

"<p>[Letra de ""El Hijo Mayor""]<br>
<br>
[Intro]<br>
En vivo desde Hermosillo, Sonora<br>
De los corridones<br>
""El Hijo Mayor"", con la bandona<br>
Jálese, viejo<br>
<br>
[Verso 1]<br>
Ya no se mira pasar<br>
Ese Camaro negro por las calles en verguiza con su gente<br>
Varios lo recordarán<br>
Y sé que lo extrañarán<br>
Así como era su modo, acelerado, atrabancado y muy valiente<br>
En la sierra, donde la pasaba<br>
Y se desestresaba fumándose un gallo<br>
Pero bien águila, por si sale algún pendiente<br>
Deportivos, camionetas duras<br>
Las cortas y largas con las que portaba<br>
Por si se ocupa, por si sale algún pеndiente<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Era adicto a la adrenalina<br>
Era lo quе lo activaba y sacaba el jale en caliente<br>
En el convoy puro suicida<br>
Listos pa' tirar vergazos, no la pensaban dos veces<br>
A estas alturas ya sabrán de quién les hablo<br>
Su nombre no ocupo ni mencionarlo<br>
Yo fui el hijo mayor de aquel señor tan mentado<br>
<br>
[Interludio]<br>
Eah<br>
Arriba Sonora, compadre<br>
Con mucho respeto, cómo no<br>
<br>
[Verso 2]<br>
Mil historias que contar, mucho para platicar<br>
Son recuerdos que solo quedan grabados en la memoria de su gente<br>
Hombre con la voz de mando<br>
Disparando el mismo diablo<br>
Siempre al frente su comando y en la sierra cuántas batallas ganamos<br>
Ah, cómo echamos balazos<br>
Con muy buenos aparatos<br>
Y en la empresa de mi apá hay pa' eso y más<br>
Mas no sabía lo que le esperaba<br>
Una mala jugada de pronto llegaba<br>
Pero así es la vida, de repente se nos va<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Era adicto a la adrenalina<br>
Era lo que lo activaba y sacaba el jale en caliente<br>
En el convoy puro suicida<br>
Listos pa tirar vergazos, no la pensaban dos veces<br>
A estas alturas ya sabrán de quién les hablo<br>
Su nombre no ocupo ni mencionarlo<br>

"<p>Look out for yourself<br>
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows<br>
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground<br>
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told<br>
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned<br>
Tell you, you're the greatest<br>
But once you turn, they hate us<br>
Oh, the misery<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>

My enemy<br>
(Look out for yourself)<br>
But I'm ready<br>
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall<br>
And the laughter in the halls<br>
And the names that I've been called<br>
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time<br>
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic<br>

I'm praying that somebody hope for me<br>
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be<br>
P-posted, being a wreck of emotions<br>
Ready to go whenever, just let me know<br>
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor<br>
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""<br>
They wanna plot on my trot to the top<br>
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box<br>
I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock<br>
To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I had it<br>
And I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'<br>
They want a static with precision, I'm automatic quarterback<br>
I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up<br>
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Oh, the misery<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""Y LLORO""]<br>
<br>
[Verso 1]<br>
No hay mensajes de mi amor<br>
Esa niña ya cambió<br>
No supe ni cómo fue<br>
Tan solo no la miré<br>
Y poco a poco, bebé, tú te me alejabas más<br>
Ya no quise ni entender el por qué ahora ya no estás<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Y lloro<br>
Baby, te juro que me siento solo<br>
Y aunque a veces a la noche le imploro<br>
Que vuelvas porque ahora me siento solo<br>
Aunque a veces tomando no la aguanto<br>
Y me dice que no será pa' tanto<br>
Y yo intentando contener mi llanto<br>
Haciendo como que no duele tanto<br>
<br>
[Interludio]<br>
Puro Junior H<br>
Cómo no<br>
<br>
[Verso 2]<br>
Te fuiste sin dar razón<br>
Me dio un beso y se marchó<br>
Pensé todo estaba bien<br>
Pero creo que así no fue<br>
Si de mí todo entregué<br>
Y siempre me han pagado mal<br>
El cora que te regalé lo dejaste en mi casa<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Y lloro<br>
Baby, te juro que me siento solo<br>
Y aunque a veces a la noche le imploro<br>

Y me dice que no será pa' tanto<br>

[Couplet 3 : Jack Harlow]<br>
Je suis sur mon Jungkook<br>
Je déshabille une fille en un regard<br>
Et quand elles se font prendre, elles sont jamais relâchées<br>
Quand j’ai vu ce corps, on aurait cru que c’était un cadavre<br>
Comme j’ai dit à mes potes « Venez voir »<br>
J’avais pour habitude d’emmener des filles à Stony Brook<br>
Et leur voler le cœur comme un escroc, vraie histoire<br>
Maintenant quand je tiens la main de quelqu’un, c’est une autre histoire<br>
Toutes mes ABG se font belles pour moi<br>
J’avais une meuf, trop ennuyeux<br>
Deux meufs, c’était cool pour moi<br>
Trois meufs, punaise, le mec a faim<br>
Quatre meufs, ok là tu te prostitues<br>
(Hey hey hey)<br>
Je suis impur<br>
J’arrête mon bon usage de ces champis<br>
J’arrête de mettre la ville sur mon dos<br>
Et le monde connaît mon nom, je suis la vérité<br>
<br>
[Refrain : Jungkook et Jack harlow]<br>

[Outro : Jack Harlow]<br>
Je t’ai fait jouer avec toi même en caméra<br>
T’es ma bae, juste comme Tampa<br>
En parlant d’argent, j’en ai<br>
Et quant aux baises, et bien, pas ça<br>
Et quant aux putes, et bien, est-ce que tu veux vraiment savoir ? C’est bien ce qu’il me semblait<br>
Je te ferai voler depuis la Corée vers le Kentucky<br>
Et tu n’as rien à me garantir, je veux juste voir si je suis chanceux<br>
Je veux juste te rencontrer en personne et voir si tu me toucherais</p>

[Refrán: KAROL G, <i>KAROL G &amp; Peso Pluma</i>]<br>
Ayer te vi solita<br>
Esa carita bonita<br>
Diablo, qué mamacita<br>
Estás provocándome aunque lo haces sin querer<br>
Ya por ti pregunté y hace más de un mes<br>
<i>Te dejaste con el bobo aquel</i><br>

[Coro: KAROL G &amp; <i>Peso Pluma</i>]<br>
Qué hijueputas ganas tengo de besarte<br>
Te vi en una foto y te imaginé sin ropa<br>
Te mentiría si no estoy loca por verte<br>
Con ese jeancito cómo te ves de culona<br>
<i>Qué hijueputa gana tengo de besarte</i><br>

[Verso 1: KAROL G]<br>
Nos vamos de guayeteo, fumeteo, en la disco mero perreo<br>
Te pusiste minifalda pa' ver si yo te gateo<br>
Un besito pa' sentir ese goteo<br>
Y prendí la cámara pa' grabarte un video<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Peso Pluma &amp; <b>KAROL G</b>, <i>Ambos</i>]<br>
No te voy a mentir, no paro 'e imaginarme tu culo en tanga<br>
Pónteme de espalda hasta que el sol salga<br>
Te pongas caliente y todo el cuerpo arda, arda<br>
Te pongas caliente como la arena<br>
Y ese culito blanco el sol te lo ponga moreno<br>
Lo tiene grandote por el entreno<br>
Empieza el toque-toque, mojaíta', flow sereno<br>

Better than he can<br>
