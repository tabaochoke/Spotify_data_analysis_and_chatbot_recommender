"<p>[Verse 1: Liam]<br>
You're insecure, don't know what for<br>
You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door<br>
Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)<br>
Bein' the way that you are is enough<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]<br>
Everyone else in the room can see it<br>
Everyone else but you<br>
<br>
[Chorus: All, <i>Harry</i>]<br>
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else<br>
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed<br>
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell<br>
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful<br>
If only you saw what I can see<br>
You'll understand why I want you so desperately<br>
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe<br>

THE AIR-SHIP<br>
<br>
         <a href=""/5064958/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Imagine-if-you-can"" data-id=""5064958"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Imagine, if you can</a>, a small room, hexagonal in shape, <a href=""/5064970/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Like-the-cell-of-a-bee"" data-id=""5064970"" class=""has_comments has_verified_annotation"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">like the cell of a bee</a>. It is lighted neither by window nor by lamp, yet it is filled with a soft radiance. There are no apertures for ventilation, yet the air is fresh. There are no musical instruments, and yet, at the moment that my meditation opens, this room is throbbing with melodious sounds. <a href=""/5064991/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/An-armchair-is-in-the-centre-by-its-side-a-reading-deskthat-is-all-the-furniture"" data-id=""5064991"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">An armchair is in the centre, by its side a reading-desk—that is all the furniture</a>.

        An electric bell rang.<br>
        The woman touched a switch and the music was silent.<br>
         ""I suppose I must see who it is"", she thought, and set her chair in motion. <a href=""/4124428/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-chair-like-the-music-was-worked-by-machinery"" data-id=""4124428"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">The chair, like the music, was worked by machinery</a> and it rolled her to the other side of the room where the bell still rang importunately.<br>
         ""Who is it?"" she called. Her voice was irritable, for she had been interrupted often since the music began. She knew several thousand people; in certain directions <a href=""/5065829/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Human-intercourse"" data-id=""5065829"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">human intercourse</a> had advanced enormously.<br>

It only gave a general idea of people</a>—an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes, Vashti thought. <a href=""/5065994/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-imponderable-bloom"" data-id=""5065994"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">The imponderable bloom</a>, declared by a discredited philosophy to be the actual essence of intercourse, was rightly ignored by the Machine,<a href=""/5066007/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Just-as-the-imponderable-bloom-of-the-grape-was-ignored-by-the-manufacturers-of-artificial-fruit"" data-id=""5066007"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted""> just as the imponderable bloom of the grape was ignored by the manufacturers of artificial fruit</a>. Something ""good enough"" had long since been accepted by our race.<br>
         ""The truth is,"" he continued, ""that I want to see these stars again. They are curious stars. I want to see them not from the air-ship, but from the surface of the earth, as our ancestors did, thousands of years ago. <a href=""/4124477/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/I-want-to-visit-the-surface-of-the-earth"" data-id=""4124477"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">I want to visit the surface of the earth.""</a><br>
         She was shocked again.<br>
         ""Mother, you must come, if only to explain to me what is the harm of visiting the surface of the earth.""<br>
         ""No harm,"" she replied, controlling herself. ""But no advantage. The surface of the earth is only dust and mud; no life remains on it, and you would need a respirator, or the cold of the outer air would kill you. One dies immediately in the outer air.""<br>
         ""I know; of course I shall take all precautions.""<br>
         ""And besides—""<br>
         ""Well?""<br>
         She considered, and chose her words with care. Her son had a queer temper, and she wished to dissuade him from the expedition.<br>
         ""It is contrary to <a href=""/5066063/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-spirit-of-the-age"" data-id=""5066063"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the spirit of the age</a>,"" she asserted.<br>
         ""Do you mean by that, contrary to the Machine?""<br>
         ""In a sense, but—""<br>
         His image is the blue plate faded.<br>
         ""Kuno!""<br>
         He had isolated himself.<br>
         For a moment Vashti felt lonely.<br>
         <a href=""/5068710/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Then-she-generated-the-light"" data-id=""5068710"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Then she generated the light</a>, and the sight of her room, flooded with radiance and studded with electric buttons, revived her. There were buttons and switches everywhere—<a href=""/5068721/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Buttons-to-call-for-food-for-music-for-clothing"" data-id=""5068721"" class=""has_pending_edits"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">buttons to call for food, for music, for clothing</a>. There was the hot-bath button, by pressure of which a basin of (imitation) marble rose out of the floor, filled to the brim with a warm deodorized liquid. There was the cold-bath button. There was the button that produced literature. And there were of course the buttons by which she communicated with her friends. The room, though it contained nothing, was in touch with all that she cared for in the world.<br>
         Vashti's next move was to turn off the isolation switch, and all the accumulations of the last three minutes burst upon her. The room was filled with the noise of bells, and speaking-tubes. What was the new food like? Could she recommend it? Has she had any ideas lately? Might one tell her one's own ideas? Would she make an engagement to visit the public nurseries at an early date?—say this day month.<br>
         <a href=""/4124491/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/To-most-of-these-questions-she-replied-with-irritationa-growing-quality-in-that-accelerated-age"" data-id=""4124491"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">To most of these questions she replied with irritation—a growing quality in that accelerated age.</a> She said that the new food was horrible. That she could not visit the public nurseries through press of engagements. That she had no ideas of her own but had just been told one—that four stars and three in the middle were like a man: she doubted there was much in it. Then she switched off her correspondents, for it was time to deliver her lecture on Australian music.<br>
         <a href=""/5068752/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-clumsy-system-of-public-gatherings-had-been-long-since-abandoned"" data-id=""5068752"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">The clumsy system of public gatherings had been long since abandoned</a>; neither Vashti nor her audience stirred from their rooms. Seated in her armchair she spoke, while they in their armchairs heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well. She opened with a humorous account of music in the pre-Mongolian epoch, and went on to describe the great outburst of song that followed the Chinese conquest. Remote and primæval as were the methods of I-San-So and the Brisbane school, she yet felt (she said) that study of them might repay the musicians of today: they had freshness; they had, above all, ideas. Her lecture, which lasted ten minutes, was well received, and at its conclusion she and many of her audience listened to a lecture on the sea; there were ideas to be got from the sea; the speaker had donned a respirator and visited it lately. Then she <a href=""/5069387/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Fed"" data-id=""5069387"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">fed</a>, talked to many friends, had a bath, talked again, and summoned her bed.<br>
         <a href=""/4124560/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-bed-was-not-to-her-liking-it-was-too-large-and-she-had-a-feeling-for-a-small-bed-complaint-was-useless-for-beds-were-of-the-same-dimension-all-over-the-world-and-to-have-had-an-alternative-size-would-have-involved-vast-alterations-in-the-machine"" data-id=""4124560"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">The bed was not to her liking. It was too large, and she had a feeling for a small bed. Complaint was useless, for beds were of the same dimension all over the world, and to have had an alternative size would have involved vast alterations in the Machine.</a> Vashti isolated herself—it was necessary, for neither day nor night existed under the ground—and reviewed all that had happened <a href=""/5069409/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Since-she-had-summoned-the-bed-last"" data-id=""5069409"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">since she had summoned the bed last</a>. Ideas? Scarcely any. Events—was Kuno's invitation an event?<br>
         By her side, on the little reading-desk, was a survival from <a href=""/5069414/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-ages-of-litter"" data-id=""5069414"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the ages of litter</a>—one book. This was the Book of the Machine. In it were instructions against every possible contingency. If she was hot or cold or <a href=""/5069426/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Dyspeptic"" data-id=""5069426"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">dyspeptic</a> or at a loss for a word, she went to the book, and it told her which button to press. The Central Committee published it. <a href=""/5069428/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/In-accordance-with-a-growing-habit-it-was-richly-bound"" data-id=""5069428"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">In accordance with a growing habit, it was richly bound</a>.<br>
         Sitting up in the bed, she took it reverently in her hands. She glanced round the glowing room as if some one might be watching her. Then, half ashamed, half joyful, she murmured, ""O Machine! O Machine!"" and raised the volume to her lips. <a href=""/5069439/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Thrice-she-kissed-it"" data-id=""5069439"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Thrice she kissed it</a>, thrice inclined her head, thrice she felt the delirium of acquiescence. Her ritual performed, she turned to page 1367, which gave the times of the departure of the air-ships from the island in the southern hemisphere, under whose soil she lived, to the island in the northern hemisphere, whereunder lived her son.<br>
         She thought, ""I have not the time.""<br>
         <a href=""/5069448/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/She-made-the-room-dark-and-slept-she-awoke-and-made-the-room-light-she-ate-and-exchanged-ideas-with-her-friends-and-listened-to-music-and-attended-lectures-she-made-the-room-dark-and-slept"" data-id=""5069448"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">She made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music and attended lectures; she made the room dark and slept</a>. Above her, beneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not notice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth, carrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the invisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room light.<br>
         ""Kuno!""<br>
         ""I will not talk to you,"" he answered, ""until you come.""<br>
         ""Have you been on the surface of the earth since we spoke last?""<br>
         His image faded.<br>
         Again she consulted the book. She became very nervous and lay back in her chair palpitating. Think of her as without teeth or hair. Presently she directed the chair to the wall, and pressed an unfamiliar button. The wall swung apart slowly. Through the opening she saw a tunnel that curved slightly, so that its goal was not visible. Should she go to see her son, here was the beginning of the journey.<br>
         Of course she knew all about the communication system. There was nothing mysterious in it. She would summon a car and it would fly with her down the tunnel until it reached the lift that communicated with the air-ship station: the system had been in use for many, many years, long before the universal establishment of the Machine. And of course she had studied the civilization that had immediately preceded her own—the civilization that had mistaken the functions of the system, and had used it <a href=""/5069689/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/For-bringing-people-to-things"" data-id=""5069689"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">for bringing people to things</a>, instead of for bringing things to people. Those funny old days, when men went for change of air instead of changing the air in their rooms! And yet—she was frightened of the tunnel: she had not seen it since her last child was born. It curved—but not quite as she remembered; it was brilliant—but not quite as brilliant as a lecturer had suggested. Vashti was seized with <a href=""/5069697/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-terrors-of-direct-experience"" data-id=""5069697"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the terrors of direct experience</a>. She shrank back into the room, and the wall closed up again.<br>
         ""Kuno,"" she said, ""I cannot come to see you. I am not well.""<br>
         <a href=""/11539574/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Immediately-an-enormous-apparatus-fell-onto-her-out-of-the-ceiling-a-thermometer-was-automatically-laid-upon-her-heart-she-lay-powerless"" data-id=""11539574"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Immediately an enormous apparatus fell onto her out of the ceiling, a thermometer was automatically laid upon her heart. She lay powerless.</a> Cool pads soothed her forehead. Kuno had <a href=""/5069705/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Telegraphed"" data-id=""5069705"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">telegraphed</a> to her doctor.<br>
         So the human passions still blundered up and down in the Machine. Vashti drank the medicine that the doctor projected into her mouth, and the machinery retired into the ceiling. The voice of Kuno was heard asking how she felt.<br>
         ""Better."" Then with irritation: ""But why do you not come to me instead?""<br>
         ""Because I cannot leave this place.""<br>
         ""Why?""<br>
         ""Because, any moment, something tremendous may happen.""<br>
         ""Have you been on the surface of the earth yet?""<br>
         ""Not yet.""<br>
         ""Then what is it?""<br>
         <a href=""/5399334/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/I-will-not-tell-you-through-the-machine"" data-id=""5399334"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">""I will not tell you through the Machine.""</a><br>
         She resumed her life.<br>
         But she thought of Kuno as a baby, his birth, his removal to <a href=""/5069807/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-public-nurseries"" data-id=""5069807"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the public nurseries</a>, her own visit to him there, his visits to her—visits which stopped when the Machine had assigned him a room on the other side of the earth. ""Parents, duties of,"" said the book of the Machine, ""cease at the moment of birth. <a href=""/11539605/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/P422327483"" data-id=""11539605"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">P.422327483.</a>"" True, but there was something special about Kuno—<a href=""/5070585/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Indeed-there-had-been-something-special-about-all-her-children"" data-id=""5070585"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">indeed there had been something special about all her children</a>—and, after all, she must brave the journey if he desired it. And ""something tremendous might happen"". What did that mean? The nonsense of a youthful man, no doubt, but she must go. Again she pressed the unfamiliar button, again the wall swung back, and she saw the tunnel that curves out of sight. Clasping the Book, she rose, tottered onto the platform, and summoned the car. Her room closed behind her: the journey to the northern hemisphere had begun.<br>
         Of course it was perfectly easy. The car approached and in it she found armchairs exactly like her own. When she signaled, it stopped, and she tottered into the lift. One other passenger was in the lift, the first fellow creature she had seen face to face for months. <a href=""/4124571/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Few-travelled-in-these-days-for-thanks-to-the-advance-of-science-the-earth-was-exactly-alike-all-over-rapid-intercourse-from-which-the-previous-civilization-had-hoped-so-much-had-ended-by-defeating-itself-what-was-the-good-of-going-to-peking-when-it-was-just-like-shrewsbury-why-return-to-shrewsbury-when-it-would-all-be-like-peking-men-seldom-moved-their-bodies-all-unrest-was-concentrated-in-the-soul"" data-id=""4124571"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Few travelled in these days, for, thanks to the advance of science, the earth was exactly alike all over. Rapid intercourse, from which the previous civilization had hoped so much, had ended by defeating itself. What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul.</a><br>
         The air-ship service was a relic from the former age. It was kept up, because it was easier to keep it up than to stop it or to diminish it, but it now far exceeded the wants of the population. Vessel after vessel would rise from the <a href=""/5070609/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Vomitories"" data-id=""5070609"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">vomitories</a> of Rye or of Christchurch (I use the antique names), would sail into the crowded sky, and would draw up at the wharves of the south—empty. So nicely adjusted was the system, so independent of meteorology, that the sky, whether calm or cloudy, <a href=""/5070618/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Resembled-a-vast-kaleidoscope"" data-id=""5070618"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">resembled a vast kaleidoscope</a> whereon the same patterns periodically recurred. The ship on which Vashti sailed started now at sunset, now at dawn. But always, as it passed above Rheas, it would neighbour the ship that served between Helsingfors and the Brazils, and, every third time it surmounted the Alps, the fleet of Palermo would cross its track behind. Night and day, wind and storm, tide and earthquake, impeded man no longer. <a href=""/5070634/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/He-had-harnessed-leviathan"" data-id=""5070634"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">He had harnessed Leviathan</a>. All the old literature, with its praise of Nature, and its fear of Nature, rang false as the prattle of a child.<br>
         Yet as Vashti saw the vast flank of the ship, stained with exposure to the outer air, her horror of direct experience returned. It was not quite like the air-ship in the cinematophote. For one thing it smelt—not strongly or unpleasantly, but it did smell, and with her eyes shut she should have known that a new thing was close to her. Then she had to walk to it from the lift, had to submit to glances form the other passengers. The man in front dropped his Book—no great matter, but it disquieted them all. In the rooms, if the Book was dropped, the floor raised it mechanically, but the gangway to the air-ship was not so prepared, and the sacred volume lay motionless. They stopped—the thing was unforeseen—and the man, instead of picking up his property, felt the muscles of his arm to see how they had failed him. Then some one actually said with direct utterance: ""We shall be late""—and they trooped on board, Vashti treading on the pages as she did so.<br>
         Inside, her anxiety increased. The arrangements were old-fashioned and rough. <a href=""/5071320/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/There-was-even-a-female-attendant-to-whom-she-would-have-to-announce-her-wants-during-the-voyage"" data-id=""5071320"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">There was even a female attendant, to whom she would have to announce her wants during the voyage</a>. Of course a revolving platform ran the length of the boat, but she was expected to walk from it to her cabin. Some cabins were better than others, and she did not get the best. <a href=""/5453016/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/She-thought-the-attendant-had-been-unfair-and-spasms-of-rage-shook-her"" data-id=""5453016"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">She thought the attendant had been unfair, and spasms of rage shook her.</a> <a href=""/4124586/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-glass-valves-had-closed-she-could-not-go-back"" data-id=""4124586"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">The glass valves had closed, she could not go back.</a> She saw, at the end of the vestibule, the lift in which she had ascended going quietly up and down, empty. Beneath those corridors of shining tiles were rooms, tier below tier, reaching far into the earth, and in each room there sat a human being, eating, or sleeping, or producing ideas. And buried deep <a href=""/5071347/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/In-the-hive"" data-id=""5071347"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">in the hive</a> was her own room. Vashti was afraid.<br>
         ""O Machine! O Machine!"" she murmured,<a href=""/5071341/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/And-caressed-her-book-and-was-comforted"" data-id=""5071341"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted""> and caressed her Book, and was comforted</a>.<br>
         Then the sides of the vestibule seemed to melt together, as do the passages that we see in dreams; the lift vanished, the Book that had been dropped slid to the left and vanished, polished tiles rushed by like a stream of water, there was a slight jar, and the air-ship, issuing from its tunnel, soared above the waters of a tropical ocean.<br>
         <a href=""/4132371/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/It-was-night-for-a-moment-she-saw-the-coast-of-sumatra-edged-by-the-phosphorescence-of-waves-and-crowned-by-lighthouses-still-sending-forth-their-disregarded-beams"" data-id=""4132371"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">It was night. For a moment she saw the coast of Sumatra edged by the phosphorescence of waves, and crowned by lighthouses, still sending forth their disregarded beams</a>. These also vanished, and only the stars distracted her. They were not motionless, but swayed to and fro above her head, thronging out of one sky-light into another, as if the universe and not the air-ship was careening. And, as often happens on clear nights, they seemed now to be in perspective, now on a plane; now piled tier beyond tier into the infinite heavens, now concealing infinity, a roof limiting for ever the visions of men. In either case they seemed intolerable. ""Are we to travel in the dark?"" called the passengers angrily, and the attendant, who had been careless, generated the light, and pulled down the blinds of pliable metal. When the air-ships had been built, the desire to look direct at things still lingered in the world. Hence the extraordinary number of skylights and windows, and the proportionate discomfort to those who were civilized and refined. Even in Vashti’s cabin one star peeped through a flaw in the blind, and after a few hours' uneasy slumber, she was disturbed by an unfamiliar glow, which was the dawn.<br>
         Quick as the ship had sped westwards, <a href=""/5071377/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-earth-had-rolled-eastwards-quicker-still"" data-id=""5071377"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the earth had rolled eastwards quicker still</a>, and had dragged back Vashti and her companions towards the sun. Science could prolong the night, but only for a little, and those high hopes of neutralizing the earth’s diurnal revolution had passed, together with hopes that were possibly higher. To ""keep pace with the sun,"" or even to outstrip it, had been the aim of the civilization preceding this. Racing aeroplanes had been built for the purpose, capable of enormous speed, and steered by the greatest intellects of the epoch. Round the globe they went, round and round, westward, westward, round and round, amidst humanity’s applause. In vain. The globe went eastward quicker still, horrible accidents occurred, and the Committee of the Machine, at the time rising into prominence, declared the pursuit illegal, <a href=""/5071388/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Unmechanical"" data-id=""5071388"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">unmechanical</a>, and punishable by Homelessness.<br>
         Of Homelessness more will be said later.<br>
         Doubtless the Committee was right. Yet the attempt to ""defeat the sun"" aroused the last common interest that our race experienced about the heavenly bodies, or indeed about anything. It was the last time that men were compacted by thinking of a power outside the world. The sun had conquered, yet it was the end of his spiritual dominion. Dawn, midday, twilight, the zodiacal path, touched neither men’s lives nor their hearts, and science retreated into the ground, to concentrate herself upon problems that she was certain of solving.<br>
         So when Vashti found her cabin invaded by <a href=""/5071406/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/A-rosy-finger-of-light"" data-id=""5071406"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">a rosy finger of light</a>, she was annoyed, and tried to adjust the blind. But the blind flew up altogether, and she saw through the skylight small pink clouds, swaying against a background of blue, and as the sun crept higher, its radiance entered direct, brimming down the wall, like a golden sea. It rose and fell with the air-ship’s motion, just as waves rise and fall, but it advanced steadily, as a tide advances. Unless she was careful, it would strike her face. A spasm of horror shook her and she rang for the attendant. The attendant too was horrified, but she could do nothing; <a href=""/5071480/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/It-was-not-her-place-to-mend-the-blind"" data-id=""5071480"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">it was not her place to mend the blind</a>. She could only suggest that the lady should change her cabin, which she accordingly prepared to do.<br>
         People were almost exactly alike all over the world, but the attendant of the air-ship, perhaps owing to her exceptional duties, had grown a little out of the common. She had often to address passengers with direct speech, and this had given her a certain roughness and originality of manner. When Vashti swerved away from the sunbeams with a cry, she behaved barbarically—she put out her hand to steady her.<br>
         ""How dare you!"" exclaimed the passenger. ""<a href=""/5071411/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/You-forget-yourself"" data-id=""5071411"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">You forget yourself</a>!""<br>
         The woman was confused, and apologized for not having let her fall. People never touched one another. <a href=""/5371995/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-custom-had-become-obsolete-owing-to-the-machine"" data-id=""5371995"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">The custom had become obsolete, owing to the Machine.</a><br>
         ""Where are we now?"" asked Vashti haughtily.<br>
         ""We are over Asia,"" said the attendant, anxious to be polite.<br>
         ""Asia?""<br>
         ""You must excuse my common way of speaking. I have got into the habit of calling places over which I pass by their <a href=""/5071418/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Unmechanical"" data-id=""5071418"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">unmechanical</a> names.""<br>
         ""Oh, I remember Asia. The Mongols came from it.""<br>
         ""Beneath us, in the open air, stood a city that was once called <a href=""/5071432/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Simla"" data-id=""5071432"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Simla</a>.""<br>
         ""Have you ever heard of the Mongols and of the Brisbane school?""<br>
         ""No.""<br>
         ""Brisbane also stood in the open air.""<br>
         ""Those mountains to the right—let me show you them."" She pushed back a metal blind. The main chain of the Himalayas was revealed. ""They were once called <a href=""/5071444/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-roof-of-the-world"" data-id=""5071444"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the Roof of the World</a>, those mountains.""<br>
         ""What a foolish name!""<br>
         ""You must remember that, before the dawn of civilization, they seemed to be an impenetrable wall that touched the stars. It was supposed that no one but the gods could exist above their summits. <a href=""/5071452/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/How-we-have-advanced-thanks-to-the-machine"" data-id=""5071452"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!</a>""<br>
         ""How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!"" said Vashti.<br>
         ""How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!"" echoed the passenger who had dropped his Book the night before, and who was standing in the passage.<br>
         ""And that white stuff in the cracks?—what is it?""<br>
         ""I have forgotten its name.""<br>
         ""Cover the window, please. These mountains give me no ideas.""<br>
         The northern aspect of the Himalayas was in deep shadow: on the Indian slope the sun had just prevailed. The forests had been destroyed during the literature epoch for the purpose of making newspaper-pulp, but the snows were awakening to their morning glory, and clouds still hung on the breasts of <a href=""/5071463/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Kinchinjunga"" data-id=""5071463"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Kinchinjunga</a>. In the plain were seen the ruins of cities, with diminished rivers creeping by their walls, and by the sides of these were sometimes the signs of vomitories, marking the cities of today. Over the whole prospect air-ships rushed, crossing and intercrossing with incredible aplomb, and rising nonchalantly when they desired to escape the perturbations of the lower atmosphere and to traverse the Roof of the World.<br>
         ""We have indeed advance, thanks to the Machine,"" repeated the attendant, and hid the Himalayas behind a metal blind.<br>
         The day dragged wearily forward. The passengers sat each in his cabin, avoiding one another with an almost physical repulsion and longing to be once more under the surface of the earth. There were eight or ten of them, mostly young males, sent out from the public nurseries to inhabit the rooms of those who had died in various parts of the earth. The man who had dropped his Book was on the homeward journey. <a href=""/5071493/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/He-had-been-sent-to-sumatra-for-the-purpose-of-propagating-the-race"" data-id=""5071493"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">He had been sent to Sumatra for the purpose of propagating the race</a>. Vashti alone was travelling by her private will.<br>
         At midday she took a second glance at the earth. The air-ship was crossing another range of mountains, but she could see little, owing to clouds. Masses of black rock hovered below her, and merged indistinctly into grey. Their shapes were fantastic; <a href=""/5071534/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/One-of-them-resembled-a-prostrate-man"" data-id=""5071534"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">one of them resembled a prostrate man</a>.<br>

         In the evening she looked again. They were crossing a golden sea, in which lay many small islands and one peninsula. <a href=""/5071567/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/She-repeated-no-ideas-here-and-hid-greece-behind-a-metal-blind"" data-id=""5071567"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">She repeated, ""No ideas here,"" and hid Greece behind a metal blind</a>.<br>

<br>
II<br>
THE MENDING APPARATUS<br>
<br>
         By a vestibule, by a lift, by a tubular railway, by a platform, by a sliding door—by reversing all the steps of her departure did Vashti arrive at her son’s room, which exactly resembled her own. She might well declare that the visit was superfluous. The buttons, the knobs, the reading-desk with the Book, the temperature, the atmosphere, the illumination—all were exactly the same. And if Kuno himself, flesh of her flesh, stood close beside her at last, what profit was there in that? She was too well-bred to shake him by the hand.<br>
         Averting her eyes, she spoke as follows:<br>
         ""Here I am. I have had the most terrible journey and greatly retarded the development of my soul. It is not worth it, Kuno, it is not worth it. My time is too precious. The sunlight almost touched me, and I have met with the rudest people. I can only stop a few minutes. Say what you want to say, and then I must return.""<br>
         ""I have been threatened with Homelessness,"" said Kuno.<br>
         She looked at him now.<br>
         ""I have been threatened with Homelessness, and I could not tell you such a thing through the Machine.""<br>
         Homelessness means death. The victim is exposed to the air, which kills him.<br>
         ""I have been outside since I spoke to you last. The tremendous thing has happened, and they have discovered me.""<br>
         ""But why shouldn’t you go outside?"" she exclaimed, ""It is perfectly legal, perfectly mechanical, to visit the surface of the earth. I have lately been to a lecture on the sea; there is no objection to that; one simply summons a respirator and gets an Egression-permit. It is not the kind of thing that spiritually minded people do, and I begged you not to do it, but there is no legal objection to it.""<br>
         ""I did not get an Egression-permit.""<br>
         ""Then how did you get out?""<br>
         ""I found out a way of my own.""<br>
         The phrase conveyed no meaning to her, and he had to repeat it.<br>
         ""A way of your own?"" she whispered. ""But that would be wrong.""<br>
         ""Why?""<br>
         The question shocked her beyond measure.<br>
         ""You are beginning to worship the Machine,"" he said coldly.<br>
         ""You think it irreligious of me to have found out a way of my own. It was just what the Committee thought, when they threatened me with Homelessness.""<br>
         At this she grew angry. ""I worship nothing!"" she cried. ""I am most advanced. I don’t think you irreligious, for there is no such thing as religion left. All the fear and the superstition that existed once have been destroyed by the Machine. I only meant that to find out a way of your own was----Besides, there is no new way out.""<br>
         ""So it is always supposed.""<br>
         ""Except through the vomitories, for which one must have an Egression-permit, it is impossible to get out. The Book says so.""<br>
         ""Well, the Book’s wrong, for I have been out on my feet.""<br>
         For Kuno was possessed of a certain physical strength.<br>
         By these days it was a demerit to be muscular. Each infant was examined at birth, and all who promised undue strength were destroyed. Humanitarians may protest, but it would have been no true kindness to let an athlete live; he would never have been happy in that state of life to which the Machine had called him; he would have yearned for trees to climb, rivers to bathe in, meadows and hills against which he might measure his body. Man must be adapted to his surroundings, must he not? In the dawn of the world our weakly must be exposed on Mount Taygetus, in its twilight our strong will suffer euthanasia, that the Machine may progress, that the Machine may progress, that the Machine may progress eternally.<br>
         ""You know that we have lost the sense of space. We say <a href=""/24558778/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Space-is-annihilated-but-we-have-annihilated-not-space-but-the-sense-thereof-we-have-lost-a-part-of-ourselves"" data-id=""24558778"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">“space is annihilated”, but we have annihilated not space, but the sense thereof. We have lost a part of ourselves.</a> I determined to recover it, and I began by walking up and down the platform of the railway outside my room. Up and down, until I was tired, and so did recapture the meaning of “Near” and “Far”. “Near” is a place to which I can get quickly on my feet, not a place to which the train or the air-ship will take me quickly. “Far” is a place to which I cannot get quickly on my feet; the vomitory is “far”, though I could be there in thirty-eight seconds by summoning the train. Man is the measure. That was my first lesson. Man’s feet are the measure for distance, his hands are the measure for ownership, his body is the measure for all that is lovable and desirable and strong. Then I went further: it was then that I called to you for the first time, and you would not come.<br>
         ""This city, as you know, is built deep beneath the surface of the earth, with only the vomitories protruding. Having paced the platform outside my own room, I took the lift to the next platform and paced that also, and so with each in turn, until I came to the topmost, above which begins the earth. All the platforms were exactly alike, and all that I gained by visiting them was to develop my sense of space and my muscles. I think I should have been content with this—it is not a little thing,—but as I walked and brooded, it occurred to me that our cities had been built in the days when men still breathed the outer air, and that there had been ventilation shafts for the workmen. I could think of nothing but these ventilation shafts. Had they been destroyed by all the food-tubes and medicine-tubes and music- tubes that the Machine has evolved lately? Or did traces of them remain? One thing was certain. If I came upon them anywhere, it would be in the railway-tunnels of the topmost storey. Everywhere else, all space was accounted for.<br>
         ""<a href=""/5218463/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/I-am-telling-my-story-quickly-but-dont-think-that-i-was-not-a-coward-or-that-your-answers-never-depressed-me-it-is-not-the-proper-thing-it-is-not-mechanical-it-is-not-decent-to-walk-along-a-railway-tunnel-i-did-not-fear-that-i-might-tread-upon-a-live-rail-and-be-killed-i-feared-something-far-more-intangible-doing-what-was-not-contemplated-by-the-machine-then-i-said-to-myself-man-is-the-measure-and-i-went-and-after-many-visits-i-found-an-opening"" data-id=""5218463"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">I am telling my story quickly, but don’t think that I was not a coward or that your answers never depressed me. It is not the proper thing, it is not mechanical, it is not decent to walk along a railway-tunnel. I did not fear that I might tread upon a live rail and be killed. I feared something far more intangible-doing what was not contemplated by the Machine. Then I said to myself, “Man is the measure”, and I went, and after many visits I found an opening.</a><br>
         ""The tunnels, of course, were lighted. Everything is light, artificial light; darkness is the exception. So when I saw a black gap in the tiles, I knew that it was an exception, and rejoiced. I put in my arm—I could put in no more at first—and waved it round and round in ecstasy. I loosened another tile, and put in my head, and shouted into the darkness: ‘I am coming, I shall do it yet,’ and my voice reverberated down endless passages. I seemed to hear the spirits of those dead workmen who had returned each evening to the starlight and to their wives, and all the generations who had lived in the open air called back to me, ‘You will do it yet, you are coming.’<br>
         He paused, and, absurd as he was, his last words moved her.<br>
         For Kuno had lately asked to be a father, and his request had been refused by the Committee. His was not a type that the Machine desired to hand on.<br>
         ""Then a train passed. It brushed by me, but I thrust my head and arms into the hole. I had done enough for one day, so I crawled back to the platform, went down in the lift, and summoned my bed. Ah what dreams! And again I called you, and again you refused.""<br>
         She shook her head and said:<br>
         ""Don’t. Don’t talk of these terrible things. You make me miserable. You are throwing civilization away.""<br>
         ""But I had got back the sense of space and a man cannot rest then. I determined to get in at the hole and climb the shaft. And so I exercised my arms. Day after day I went through ridiculous movements, until my flesh ached, and I could hang by my hands and hold the pillow of my bed outstretched for many minutes. Then I summoned a respirator, and started.<br>
         ""It was easy at first. The mortar had somehow rotted, and I soon pushed some more tiles in, and clambered after them into the darkness, and the spirits of the dead comforted me. I don’t know what I mean by that. I just say what I felt. I felt, for the first time, that a protest had been lodged against corruption, and that even as the dead were comforting me, so I was comforting the unborn. I felt that humanity existed, and that it existed without clothes. How can I possibly explain this? It was naked, humanity seemed naked, and all these tubes and buttons and machineries neither came into the world with us, nor will they follow us out, nor do they matter supremely while we are here. Had I been strong, I would have torn off every garment I had, and gone out into the outer air unswaddled. But this is not for me, nor perhaps for my generation. I climbed with my respirator and my hygienic clothes and my dietetic tabloids! Better thus than not at all.<br>
         ""There was a ladder, made of some primæval metal. The light from the railway fell upon its lowest rungs, and I saw that it led straight upwards out of the rubble at the bottom of the shaft. Perhaps our ancestors ran up and down it a dozen times daily, in their building. As I climbed, the rough edges cut through my gloves so that my hands bled. The light helped me for a little, and then came darkness and, worse still, silence which pierced my ears like a sword. The Machine hums! Did you know that? Its hum penetrates our blood, and may even guide our thoughts. Who knows! I was getting beyond its power. Then I thought: “This silence means that I am doing wrong.” But I heard voices in the silence, and again they strengthened me."" He laughed. ""I had need of them. The next moment I cracked my head against something.""<br>
         She sighed.<br>
         ""I had reached one of those pneumatic stoppers that defend us from the outer air. You may have noticed them on the air- ship. Pitch dark, my feet on the rungs of an invisible ladder, my hands cut; I cannot explain how I lived through this part, but the voices till comforted me, and I felt for fastenings. The stopper, I suppose, was about eight feet across. I passed my hand over it as far as I could reach. It was perfectly smooth. I felt it almost to the centre. Not quite to the centre, for my arm was too short. Then the voice said: “Jump. It is worth it. There may be a handle in the centre, and you may catch hold of it and so come to us your own way. And if there is no handle, so that you may fall and are dashed to pieces—it is still worth it: you will still come to us your own way.” So I jumped. There was a handle, and—""<br>
         He paused. Tears gathered in his mother’s eyes. She knew that he was fated. If he did not die today he would die tomorrow. There was not room for such a person in the world. And with her pity disgust mingled. She was ashamed at having borne such a son, she who had always been so respectable and so full of ideas. Was he really the little boy to whom she had taught the use of his stops and buttons, and to whom she had given his first lessons in the Book? The very hair that disfigured his lip showed that he was reverting to some savage type. On atavism the Machine can have no mercy.<br>
         ""There was a handle, and I did catch it. I hung tranced over the darkness and heard the hum of these workings as the last whisper in a dying dream. All the things I had cared about and all the people I had spoken to through tubes appeared infinitely little. Meanwhile the handle revolved. My weight had set something in motion and I span slowly, and then----<br>
         ""I cannot describe it. I was lying with my face to the sunshine. Blood poured from my nose and ears and I heard a tremendous roaring. The stopper, with me clinging to it, had simply been blown out of the earth, and the air that we make down here was escaping through the vent into the air above. It burst up like a fountain. I crawled back to it—for the upper air hurts—and, as it were, I took great sips from the edge. My respirator had flown goodness knows here, my clothes were torn. I just lay with my lips close to the hole, and I sipped until the bleeding stopped. You can imagine nothing so curious. This hollow in the grass—I will speak of it in a minute,—the sun shining into it, not brilliantly but through marbled clouds,—the peace, the nonchalance, the sense of space, and, brushing my cheek, the roaring fountain of our artificial air! Soon I spied my respirator, bobbing up and down in the current high above my head, and higher still were many air-ships. But no one ever looks out of air-ships, and in any case they could not have picked me up. There I was, stranded. The sun shone a little way down the shaft, and revealed the topmost rung of the ladder, but it was hopeless trying to reach it. I should either have been tossed up again by the escape, or else have fallen in, and died. I could only lie on the grass, sipping and sipping, and from time to time glancing around me.<br>
         ""I knew that I was in Wessex, for I had taken care to go to a lecture on the subject before starting. Wessex lies above the room in which we are talking now. It was once an important state. Its kings held all the southern coast form the Andredswald to Cornwall, while the Wansdyke protected them on the north, running over the high ground. The lecturer was only concerned with the rise of Wessex, so I do not know how long it remained an international power, nor would the knowledge have assisted me. To tell the truth I could do nothing but laugh, during this part. There was I, with a pneumatic stopper by my side and a respirator bobbing over my head, imprisoned, all three of us, in a grass-grown hollow that was edged with fern.""<br>
         Then he grew grave again.<br>
         ""Lucky for me that it was a hollow. For the air began to fall back into it and to fill it as water fills a bowl. I could crawl about. Presently I stood. I breathed a mixture, in which the air that hurts predominated whenever I tried to climb the sides. This was not so bad. I had not lost my tabloids and remained ridiculously cheerful, and as for the Machine, I forgot about it altogether. My one aim now was to get to the top, where the ferns were, and to view whatever objects lay beyond.<br>
         ""I rushed the slope. The new air was still too bitter for me and I came rolling back, after a momentary vision of something grey. The sun grew very feeble, and I remembered that he was in Scorpio—I had been to a lecture on that too. If the sun is in Scorpio, and you are in Wessex, it means that you must be as quick as you can, or it will get too dark. (This is the first bit of useful information I have ever got from a lecture, and I expect it will be the last.) It made me try frantically to breathe the new air, and to advance as far as I dared out of my pond. The hollow filled so slowly. At times I thought that the fountain played with less vigour. My respirator seemed to dance nearer the earth; the roar was decreasing.""<br>
         He broke off.<br>
         ""I don’t think this is interesting you. The rest will interest you even less. There are no ideas in it, and I wish that I had not troubled you to come. We are too different, mother.""<br>
         She told him to continue.<br>
         ""It was evening before I climbed the bank. The sun had very nearly slipped out of the sky by this time, and I could not get a good view. You, who have just crossed the Roof of the World, will not want to hear an account of the little hills that I saw—low colourless hills. But to me they were living and the turf that covered them was a skin, under which their muscles rippled, and I felt that those hills had called with incalculable force to men in the past, and that men had loved them. Now they sleep—perhaps for ever. They commune with humanity in dreams. Happy the man, happy the woman, who awakes the hills of Wessex. For though they sleep, they will never die.""<br>
         His voice rose passionately.<br>
         ""Cannot you see, cannot all you lecturers see, that it is we that are dying, and that down here the only thing that really lives in the Machine? We created the Machine, to do our will, but we cannot make it do our will now. It was robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch, it has blurred every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act, it has paralysed our bodies and our wills, and now it compels us to worship it. The Machine develops—but not on our lies. The Machine proceeds—but not to our goal. We only exist as the blood corpuscles that course through its arteries, and if it could work without us, it would let us die. Oh, I have no remedy—or, at least, only one—to tell men again and again that I have seen the hills of Wessex as Ælfrid saw them when he overthrew the Danes.<br>
         ""So the sun set. I forgot to mention that a belt of mist lay between my hill and other hills, and that it was the colour of pearl.""<br>
         He broke off for the second time.<br>
         ""Go on,"" said his mother wearily.<br>
         He shook his head.<br>
         ""Go on. Nothing that you say can distress me now. I am hardened.""<br>
         ""I had meant to tell you the rest, but I cannot: I know that I cannot: good-bye.""<br>
         Vashti stood irresolute. All her nerves were tingling with his blasphemies. But she was also inquisitive.<br>
         ""This is unfair,"" she complained. ""You have called me across the world to hear your story, and hear it I will. Tell me—as briefly as possible, for this is a disastrous waste of time—tell me how you returned to civilization.""<br>
         ""Oh—that!"" he said, starting. ""You would like to hear about civilization. Certainly. Had I got to where my respirator fell down?""<br>
         ""No—but I understand everything now. You put on your respirator, and managed to walk along the surface of the earth to a vomitory, and there your conduct was reported to the Central Committee.""<br>
         ""By no means.""<br>
         He passed his hand over his forehead, as if dispelling some strong impression. Then, resuming his narrative, he warmed to it again.<br>
         ""My respirator fell about sunset. I had mentioned that the fountain seemed feebler, had I not?""<br>
         ""Yes.""<br>
         ""About sunset, it let the respirator fall. As I said, I had entirely forgotten about the Machine, and I paid no great attention at the time, being occupied with other things. I had my pool of air, into which I could dip when the outer keenness became intolerable, and which would possibly remain for days, provided that no wind sprang up to disperse it. Not until it was too late did I realize what the stoppage of the escape implied. You see—the gap in the tunnel had been mended; the Mending Apparatus; the Mending Apparatus, was after me.<br>
         ""One other warning I had, but I neglected it. The sky at night was clearer than it had been in the day, and the moon, which was about half the sky behind the sun, shone into the dell at moments quite brightly. I was in my usual place—on the boundary between the two atmospheres—when I thought I saw something dark move across the bottom of the dell, and vanish into the shaft. In my folly, I ran down. I bent over and listened, and I thought I heard a faint scraping noise in the depths.<br>
         ""At this—but it was too late—I took alarm. I determined to put on my respirator and to walk right out of the dell. But my respirator had gone. I knew exactly where it had fallen—between the stopper and the aperture—and I could even feel the mark that it had made in the turf. It had gone, and I realized that something evil was at work, and I had better escape to the other air, and, if I must die, die running towards the cloud that had been the colour of a pearl. I never started. Out of the shaft—it is too horrible. A worm, a long white worm, had crawled out of the shaft and gliding over the moonlit grass.<br>
         ""I screamed. I did everything that I should not have done, I stamped upon the creature instead of flying from it, and it at once curled round the ankle. Then we fought. The worm let me run all over the dell, but edged up my leg as I ran. “Help!” I cried. (That part is too awful. It belongs to the part that you will never know.) “Help!” I cried. (Why cannot we suffer in silence?) “Help!” I cried. When my feet were wound together, I fell, I was dragged away from the dear ferns and the living hills, and past the great metal stopper (I can tell you this part), and I thought it might save me again if I caught hold of the handle. It also was enwrapped, it also. Oh, the whole dell was full of the things. They were searching it in all directions, they were denuding it, and the white snouts of others peeped out of the hole, ready if needed. Everything that could be moved they brought—brushwood, bundles of fern, everything, and down we all went intertwined into hell. The last things that I saw, ere the stopper closed after us, were certain stars, and I felt that a man of my sort lived in the sky. For I did fight, I fought till the very end, and it was only my head hitting against the ladder that quieted me. I woke up in this room. The worms had vanished. I was surrounded by artificial air, artificial light, artificial peace, and my friends were calling to me down speaking-tubes to know whether I had come across any new ideas lately.""<br>
         Here his story ended. Discussion of it was impossible, and Vashti turned to go.<br>
         ""It will end in Homelessness,"" she said quietly.<br>
         ""I wish it would,"" retorted Kuno.<br>
         ""The Machine has been most merciful.""<br>
         ""I prefer the mercy of God.""<br>
         ""By that superstitious phrase, do you mean that you could live in the outer air?""<br>
         ""Yes.""<br>
         ""Have you ever seen, round the vomitories, the bones of those who were extruded after the Great Rebellion?""<br>
         ""Yes.""<br>
         ""Have you ever seen, round the vomitories, the bones of those who were extruded after the Great Rebellion?""<br>
         ""Yes.""<br>
         ""They were left where they perished for our edification. A few crawled away, but they perished, too—who can doubt it? And so with the Homeless of our own day. The surface of the earth supports life no longer.""<br>
         ""Indeed.""<br>
         ""Ferns and a little grass may survive, but all higher forms have perished. Has any air-ship detected them?""<br>
         ""No.""<br>
         ""Has any lecturer dealt with them?""<br>
         ""No.""<br>
         ""Then why this obstinacy?""<br>
         ""Because I have seen them,"" he exploded.<br>
         ""Seen what?""<br>
         ""Because I have seen her in the twilight—because she came to my help when I called—because she, too, was entangled by the worms, and, luckier than I, was killed by one of them piercing her throat.""<br>
         He was mad. Vashti departed, nor, in the troubles that followed, did she ever see his face again.<br>
        <br>
<br>
III<br>
THE HOMELESS<br>
        <br>
During the years that followed Kuno’s escapade, two important developments took place in the Machine. On the surface they were revolutionary, but in either case men’s minds had been prepared beforehand, and they did but express tendencies that were latent already.<br>
         The first of these was the abolition of respirator.<br>
         Advanced thinkers, like Vashti, had always held it foolish to visit the surface of the earth. Air-ships might be necessary, but what was the good of going out for mere curiosity and crawling along for a mile or two in a terrestrial motor? The habit was vulgar and perhaps faintly improper: it was unproductive of ideas, and had no connection with the habits that really mattered. So respirators were abolished, and with them, of course, the terrestrial motors, and except for a few lecturers, who complained that they were debarred access to their subject- matter, the development was accepted quietly. Those who still wanted to know what the earth was like had after all only to listen to some gramophone, or to look into some cinematophote. And even the lecturers acquiesced when they found that a lecture on the sea was none the less stimulating when compiled out of other lectures that had already been delivered on the same subject. ""Beware of first- hand ideas!"" exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. ""First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by live and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element—direct observation. Do not learn anything about this subject of mine—the French Revolution. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought Urizen thought Gutch thought Ho-Yung thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought LafcadioHearn thought Carlyle thought Mirabeau said about the French Revolution. Through the medium of these ten great minds, the blood that was shed at Paris and the windows that were broken at Versailles will be clarified to an idea which you may employ most profitably in your daily lives. But be sure that the intermediates are many and varied, for in history one authority exists to counteract another. Urizen must counteract the scepticism of Ho-Yung and Enicharmon, I must myself counteract the impetuosity of Gutch. You who listen to me are in a better position to judge about the French Revolution than I am. Your descendants will be even in a better position than you, for they will learn what you think I think, and yet another intermediate will be added to the chain. And in time""—his voice rose—""there will come a generation that had got beyond facts, beyond impressions, a generation absolutely colourless, a generation<br>
        <br>
         seraphically free<br>
From taint of personality,<br>
        <br>
which will see the French Revolution not as it happened, nor as they would like it to have happened, but as it would have happened, had it taken place in the days of the Machine.""<br>
         Tremendous applause greeted this lecture, which did but voice a feeling already latent in the minds of men—a feeling that terrestrial facts must be ignored, and that the abolition of respirators was a positive gain. It was even suggested that air-ships should be abolished too. This was not done, because air-ships had somehow worked themselves into the Machine’s system. But year by year they were used less, and mentioned less by thoughtful men.<br>
         The second great development was the re-establishment of religion.<br>
         This, too, had been voiced in the celebrated lecture. No one could mistake the reverent tone in which the peroration had concluded, and it awakened a responsive echo in the heart of each. Those who had long worshipped silently, now began to talk. They described the strange feeling of peace that came over them when they handled the Book of the Machine, the pleasure that it was to repeat certain numerals out of it, however little meaning those numerals conveyed to the outward ear, the ecstasy of touching a button, however unimportant, or of ringing an electric bell, however superfluously.<br>
         ""The Machine,"" they exclaimed, ""feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is the Machine."" And before long this allocution was printed on the first page of the Book, and in subsequent editions the ritual swelled into a complicated system of praise and prayer. The word ""religion"" was sedulously avoided, and in theory the Machine was still the creation and the implement of man. but in practice all, save a few retrogrades, worshipped it as divine. Nor was it worshipped in unity. One believer would be chiefly impressed by the blue optic plates, through which he saw other believers; another by the mending apparatus, which sinful Kuno had compared to worms; another by the lifts, another by the Book. And each would pray to this or to that, and ask it to intercede for him with the Machine as a whole. Persecution—that also was present. It did not break out, for reasons that will be set forward shortly. But it was latent, and all who did not accept the minimum known as ""undenominational Mechanism"" lived in danger of Homelessness, which means death, as we know.<br>
         To attribute these two great developments to the Central Committee, is to take a very narrow view of civilization. The Central Committee announced the developments, it is true, but they were no more the cause of them than were the kings of the imperialistic period the cause of war. Rather did they yield to some invincible pressure, which came no one knew whither, and which, when gratified, was succeeded by some new pressure equally invincible. To such a state of affairs it is convenient to give the name of progress. No one confessed the Machine was out of hand. Year by year it was served with increased efficiency and decreased intelligence. The better a man knew his own duties upon it, the less he understood the duties of his neighbour, and in all the world there was not one who understood the monster as a whole. Those master brains had perished. They had left full directions, it is true, and their successors had each of them mastered a portion of those directions. But Humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean the progress of the Machine.<br>
         As for Vashti, her life went peacefully forward until the final disaster. She made her room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light. She lectured and attended lectures. She exchanged ideas with her innumerable friends and believed she was growing more spiritual. At times a friend was granted Euthanasia, and left his or her room for the homelessness that is beyond all human conception. Vashti did not much mind. After an unsuccessful lecture, she would sometimes ask for Euthanasia herself. But the death-rate was not permitted to exceed the birth-rate, and the Machine had hitherto refused it to her.<br>
         The troubles began quietly, long before she was conscious of them.<br>
         One day she was astonished at receiving a message from her son. They never communicated, having nothing in common, and she had only heard indirectly that he was still alive, and had been transferred from the northern hemisphere, where he had behaved so mischievously, to the southern—indeed, to a room not far from her own.<br>
         ""Does he want me to visit him?"" she thought. ""Never again, never. And I have not the time.""<br>
         No, it was madness of another kind.<br>
         He refused to visualize his face upon the blue plate, and speaking out of the darkness with solemnity said:<br>
         ""The Machine stops.""<br>
         ""What do you say?""<br>
         ""The Machine is stopping, I know it, I know the signs.""<br>
         She burst into a peal of laughter. He heard her and was angry, and they spoke no more.<br>
         <a href=""/25458334/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Can-you-imagine-anything-more-absurd-she-cried-to-a-friend-a-man-who-was-my-son-believes-that-the-machine-is-stopping-it-would-be-impious-if-it-was-not-mad"" data-id=""25458334"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">""Can you imagine anything more absurd?"" she cried to a friend. ""A man who was my son believes that the Machine is stopping. It would be impious if it was not mad.""</a><br>
         ""The Machine is stopping?"" her friend replied. ""What does that mean? The phrase conveys nothing to me.""<br>
         ""Nor to me.""<br>
         ""He does not refer, I suppose, to the trouble there has been lately with the music?""<br>
         ""Oh no, of course not. Let us talk about music.""<br>
         ""Have you complained to the authorities?""<br>
         ""Yes, and they say it wants mending, and referred me to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus. I complained of those curious gasping sighs that disfigure the symphonies of the Brisbane school. They sound like some one in pain. The Committee of the Mending Apparatus say that it shall be remedied shortly.""<br>
         Obscurely worried, she resumed her life. For one thing, the defect in the music irritated her. For another thing, she could not forget Kuno’s speech. If he had known that the music was out of repair—he could not know it, for he detested music—if he had known that it was wrong, ""the Machine stops"" was exactly the venomous sort of remark he would have made. Of course he had made it at a venture, but the coincidence annoyed her, and she spoke with some petulance to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus.<br>
         They replied, as before, that the defect would be set right shortly.<br>
         ""Shortly! At once!"" she retorted. ""Why should I be worried by imperfect music? Things are always put right at once. If you do not mend it at once, I shall complain to the Central Committee.""<br>
         ""No personal complaints are received by the Central Committee,"" the Committee of the Mending Apparatus replied.<br>
         ""Through whom am I to make my complaint, then?""<br>
         ""Through us.""<br>
         ""I complain then.""<br>
         ""Your complaint shall be forwarded in its turn.""<br>
         ""Have others complained?""<br>
         This question was unmechanical, and the Committee of the Mending Apparatus refused to answer it.<br>
         ""It is too bad!"" she exclaimed to another of her friends.<br>
         ""There never was such an unfortunate woman as myself. I can never be sure of my music now. It gets worse and worse each time I summon it.""<br>
         ""What is it?""<br>
         ""I do not know whether it is inside my head, or inside the wall.""<br>
         ""Complain, in either case.""<br>
         ""I have complained, and my complaint will be forwarded in its turn to the Central Committee.""<br>
         Time passed, and they resented the defects no longer. The defects had not been remedied, but the human tissues in that latter day had become so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine. The sigh at the crises of the Brisbane symphony no longer irritated Vashti; she accepted it as part of the melody. The jarring noise, whether in the head or in the wall, was no longer resented by her friend. And so with the mouldy artificial fruit, so with the bath water that began to stink, so with the defective rhymes that the poetry machine had taken to emit. all were bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse unchallenged.<br>
         It was otherwise with the failure of the sleeping apparatus. That was a more serious stoppage. There came a day when over the whole world—in Sumatra, in Wessex, in the innumerable cities of Courland and Brazil—the beds, when summoned by their tired owners, failed to appear. It may seem a ludicrous matter, but from it we may date the collapse of humanity. The Committee responsible for the failure was assailed by complainants, whom it referred, as usual, to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus, who in its turn assured them that their complaints would be forwarded to the Central Committee. But the discontent grew, for mankind was not yet sufficiently adaptable to do without sleeping.<br>
         ""Some one of meddling with the Machine---"" they began.<br>
         ""Some one is trying to make himself king, to reintroduce the personal element.""<br>
         ""Punish that man with Homelessness.""<br>
         ""To the rescue! Avenge the Machine! Avenge the Machine!""<br>
         ""War! Kill the man!""<br>
         But the Committee of the Mending Apparatus now came forward, and allayed the panic with well-chosen words. It confessed that the Mending Apparatus was itself in need of repair.<br>
         The effect of this frank confession was admirable.<br>
         ""Of course,"" said a famous lecturer—he of the French Revolution, who gilded each new decay with splendour—""of course we shall not press our complaints now. The Mending Apparatus has treated us so well in the past that we all sympathize with it, and will wait patiently for its recovery. In its own good time it will resume its duties. Meanwhile let us do without our beds, our tabloids, our other little wants. Such, I feel sure, would be the wish of the Machine.""<br>
         Thousands of miles away his audience applauded. The Machine still linked them. Under the seas, beneath the roots of the mountains, ran the wires through which they saw and heard, the enormous eyes and ears that were their heritage, and the hum of many workings clothed their thoughts in one garment of subserviency. Only the old and the sick remained ungrateful, for it was rumoured that Euthanasia, too, was out of order, and that pain had reappeared among men.<br>
         It became difficult to read. A blight entered the atmosphere and dulled its luminosity. At times Vashti could scarcely see across her room. The air, too, was foul. Loud were the complaints, impotent the remedies, heroic the tone of the lecturer as he cried: ""Courage! courage! What matter so long as the Machine goes on ? To it the darkness and the light are one."" And though things improved again after a time, the old brilliancy was never recaptured, and humanity never recovered from its entrance into twilight. There was an hysterical talk of ""measures,"" of ""provisional dictatorship,"" and the inhabitants of Sumatra were asked to familiarize themselves with the workings of the central power station, the said power station being situated in France. But for the most part panic reigned, and men spent their strength praying to their Books, tangible proofs of the Machine’s omnipotence. There were gradations of terror- at times came rumours of hope-the Mending Apparatus was almost mended-the enemies of the Machine had been got under- new ""nerve-centres"" were evolving which would do the work even more magnificently than before. But there came a day when, without the slightest warning, without any previous hint of feebleness, the entire communication-system broke down, all over the world, and the world, as they understood it, ended.<br>
         Vashti was lecturing at the time and her earlier remarks had been punctuated with applause. As she proceeded the audience became silent, and at the conclusion there was no sound. Somewhat displeased, she called to a friend who was a specialist in sympathy. No sound: doubtless the friend was sleeping. And so with the next friend whom she tried to summon, and so with the next, until she remembered Kuno’s cryptic remark, ""The Machine stops"".<br>
         The phrase still conveyed nothing. If Eternity was stopping it would of course be set going shortly.<br>
         For example, there was still a little light and air—the atmosphere had improved a few hours previously. There was still the Book, and while there was the Book there was security.<br>
         Then she broke down, for with the cessation of activity came an unexpected terror—silence.<br>
         She had never known silence, and the coming of it nearly killed her—it did kill many thousands of people outright. Ever since her birth she had been surrounded by the steady hum. It was to the ear what artificial air was to the lungs, and agonizing pains shot across her head. And scarcely knowing what she did, she stumbled forward and pressed the unfamiliar button, the one that opened the door of her cell.<br>
         Now the door of the cell worked on a simple hinge of its own. It was not connected with the central power station, dying far away in France. It opened, rousing immoderate hopes in Vashti, for she thought that the Machine had been mended. It opened, and she saw the dim tunnel that curved far away towards freedom. One look, and then she shrank back. For the tunnel was full of people—she was almost the last in that city to have taken alarm.<br>
         People at any time repelled her, and these were nightmares from her worst dreams. People were crawling about, people were screaming, whimpering, gasping for breath, touching each other, vanishing in the dark, and ever and anon being pushed off the platform on to the live rail. Some were fighting round the electric bells, trying to summon trains which could not be summoned. Others were yelling for Euthanasia or for respirators, or blaspheming the Machine. Others stood at the doors of their cells fearing, like herself, either to stop in them or to leave them. And behind all the uproar was silence—the silence which is the voice of the earth and of the generations who have gone.<br>
         No—it was worse than solitude. She closed the door again and sat down to wait for the end. The disintegration went on, accompanied by horrible cracks and rumbling. The valves that restrained the Medical Apparatus must have weakened, for it ruptured and hung hideously from the ceiling. The floor heaved and fell and flung her from the chair. A tube oozed towards her serpent fashion. And at last the final horror approached—light began to ebb, and she knew that civilization’s long day was closing.<br>
         She whirled around, praying to be saved from this, at any rate, kissing the Book, pressing button after button. The uproar outside was increasing, and even penetrated the wall. Slowly the brilliancy of her cell was dimmed, the reflections faded from the metal switches. Now she could not see the reading-stand, now not the Book, though she held it in her hand. Light followed the flight of sound, air was following light, and the original void returned to the cavern from which it has so long been excluded. Vashti continued to whirl, like the devotees of an earlier religion, screaming, praying, striking at the buttons with bleeding hands.<br>
         It was thus that she opened her prison and escaped—escaped in the spirit: at least so it seems to me, ere my meditation closes. That she escapes in the body—I cannot perceive that. She struck, by chance, the switch that released the door, and the rush of foul air on her skin, the loud throbbing whispers in her ears, told her that she was facing the tunnel again, and that tremendous platform on which she had seen men fighting. They were not fighting now. Only the whispers remained, and the little whimpering groans. They were dying by hundreds out in the dark.<br>
         She burst into tears.<br>
         Tears answered her.<br>
         They wept for humanity, those two, not for themselves. They could not bear that this should be the end. Ere silence was completed their hearts were opened, and they knew what had been important on the earth. Man, the flower of all flesh, the noblest of all creatures visible, man who had once made god in his image, and had mirrored his strength on the constellations, beautiful naked man was dying, strangled in the garments that he had woven. Century after century had he toiled, and here was his reward. Truly the garment had seemed heavenly at first, shot with colours of culture, sewn with the threads of self-denial. And heavenly it had been so long as man could shed it at will and live by the essence that is his soul, and the essence, equally divine, that is his body. The sin against the body—it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend—glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.<br>
         ""Where are you?"" she sobbed.<br>
         His voice in the darkness said, ""Here.""<br>
         Is there any hope, Kuno?""<br>
         ""None for us.""<br>
         ""Where are you?""<br>
         She crawled over the bodies of the dead. His blood spurted over her hands.<br>
         ""Quicker,"" he gasped, ""I am dying—but we touch, we talk, not through the Machine.""<br>
         He kissed her.<br>
         ""We have come back to our own. We die, but we have recaptured life, as it was in Wessex, when Ælfrid overthrew the Danes. We know what they know outside, they who dwelt in the cloud that is the colour of a pearl.""<br>
         ""But Kuno, is it true ? Are there still men on the surface of the earth ? Is this—tunnel, this poisoned darkness—really not the end?""<br>
         He replied:<br>
         ""I have seen them, spoken to them, loved them. They are hiding in the midst and the ferns until our civilization stops. Today they are the Homeless—tomorrow—""<br>
         ""Oh, tomorrow—some fool will start the Machine again, tomorrow.""<br>
         ""Never,"" said Kuno, ""never. <a href=""/5234372/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Humanity-has-learnt-its-lesson"" data-id=""5234372"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Humanity has learnt its lesson</a>.""<br>
         As he spoke, the whole city was broken like a honeycomb. An air-ship had sailed in through the vomitory into a ruined wharf. It crashed downwards, exploding as it went, rending gallery after gallery with its wings of steel. For a moment they saw the nations of the dead, and, before they joined them, scraps of the untainted sky.</p>

You're gonna leave me all alone? On Christmas?<br>
Baby, what'd I ever do to deserve all that?<br>
Can't we just, like, snuggle underneath the tree? By the fireplace?<br>
You know I make those cookies you like<br>

Well, maybe this Christmastime<br>

[Intro]<br>
Dame tiempo<br>
Que no estoy en mi mejor momento<br>
Pero yo mejoro de a poquitos, sí<br>
Hoy estoy down, pero yo sé que mañana será más bonito<br>
Diferente, otra vibra, otro ambiente<br>
Hoy estoy en menos veinte<br>
Pero me recargo de mi gente<br>

Y mientras me curo del corazón<br>

Everything that lives is gone to waste</p>

Once I turn it on, I never stop, stop (Never stop)<br>
Be careful, I don't talk, I shoot (I shoot)<br>
If you still don't know, let me make it clear, clear (Clear)<br>
Playing with me always comes at a cost<br>
Soft reggaetón, bitten lips<br>
Diamonds trailing down my belly button<br>
More than one is already lost<br>
A doll from a Tarantino movie (Give it to me, papi)<br>
Go easy, you've been warned (Oh-oh)<br>
It's very likely you'll get addicted to me (Oh-oh)<br>

Quietly so that no one knows (Ah)<br>

""I got dreams and I got love<br>
I got my feet on the ground and family above<br>
Can you send some happiness with my best<br>
To the rest of the people of the East and the West<br>
And maybe every once in a while<br>
You give my grandma a reason to smile<br>
'Tis the season to smile<br>
It's cold, but we'll be freezing in style<br>
And let me meet a girl one day<br>
That wants to spread some love this way<br>
We can let our souls run free<br>
And she can open some happiness with me""<br>

There'll be parties for hosting<br>

And caroling out in the snow<br>
There'll be scary ghost stories<br>
And tales of the glories<br>
Of Christmases long, long ago<br>

It's the most wonderful time of the year<br>
There'll be much mistletoeing<br>
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near<br>

<br>
[Verso 1: Future]<br>
Costumava querer foder uma vadia do R&amp;B, então essa merda aconteceu, yeah<br>
Costumava querer ser rico, então finalmente aconteceu, pensei que isso me faria feliz (Pensei que isso me faria feliz)<br>
Eu poderia ter aguentado a dor e ter saído triste<br>
As ruas ficaram por perto e me criaram, mas eu não tenho pai<br>
Esses caras tentam me clonar, fugir com meu еstilo<br>
Por vender Coco, tenho Chanеl na minha jaqueta (Jaqueta)<br>
Essa mina me chupa gostoso sem esforço, não dura (Dura)<br>
Tô tomando mais drogas, tô sozinho numa mansão (Sozinho)<br>
Tô andando por aí, mexendo com drogas na minha mãos (Mexendo)<br>
Só mais uma vadia falida, apenas pregando por essa grana (Só mais uma vadia)<br>
E eu sei que devo receber um adiantamento de um bilhão de dólares (Uh-huh)<br>
<br>
[Refrão 1: Travis Scott &amp; <i>Future</i>]<br>
Eu pude ver o futuro, eu pude ver o futuro (Eu posso ver o futuro)<br>
Eu posso ver o futuro, parece que nivelamos o céu (Céu)<br>
Mal posso esperar pra viver na glória, na vida eterna e duradoura (<i>Viver na glória</i>)<br>
Você não quer assumir o volante? Eu me reclino e fico parado<br>
Pode muito bem aparecer agora, Ele vai aparecer sem avisar<br>
Sobre as trombetas, você gosta do jeito que soa? (<i>O jeito como soa</i>)<br>
<br>
[Pós-Refrão: Travis Scott]<br>
Você conhece o futuro do salto, ayy<br>
Eu posso ouvir seus pensamentos tão alto, eu posso ouvir a multidão tão alto<br>
Você gosta do jeito que soa? Ayy<br>
Eu posso ouvir seus pensamentos tão alto, eu posso ouvir a multidão tão alto, tão alto<br>
<br>
[Ponte: Travis Scott &amp; <i>Future</i>]<br>
Eu posso ver o futuro, tô andando com a tempestade e alguns soldados<br>
Tô andando por essa merda, essa merda é estúpida<br>
Andando por aí no céu como se eu fosse o Luke-uh<br>
Tô me esquivando de todos esses assuntos como se eu fosse Bruce-uh, super<br>
Andando com meus anjos, nos esquivando de Lúcifer (<i>Ande</i>)<br>
Vendo todos os ângulos, eu consigo ver através de você, yeah (<i>Yeah</i>)<br>
<br>

Você não quer assumir o volante? (<i>Até mais</i>) Eu me reclino e fico parado<br>
Pode muito bem aparecer agora, Ele vai aparecer sem avisar<br>
Sobre as trombetas, você gosta do jeito que soa?<br>
Você conhece o futuro do salto<br>

[Refrão 2: Future]<br>
Conto tanto dinheiro até a minha pele descascar<br>
Benz vermelho-cereja como um verdadeiro cafetão (Yeah)<br>
Meu irmão prepara as drogas, é preciso muita habilidade<br>
Divido a minha mina com a minha vadia, eu não ligo (Não)<br>
Ou você tá ganhando dinheiro ou tá fofocando (Yeah)<br>
Ela escolheu, colocou esse casaco, agora ela mente pra mim<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Future]<br>
Lugares que eu nunca pensei que iria, eu encontrei modelos em<br>
Eu ouço os demônios com clareza quando eles chamam (Yeah)<br>
Voos na Terra, então eu tive que me nomear com o nome de um planeta (Pluto)<br>
Morte automática quando você vai contra a minha família<br>
Poucos términos se tornaram públicos, eu acabei de comprar outra gostosa (Comprei outra gostosa)<br>
Essa vadia sabia que eu era tóxico quando me conheceu, eu era um selvagem (Eu era um selvagem)<br>
No alto das colinas, tô tentando evitar qualquer loucura (Yeah)<br>
Particular no Lear, é exatamente como imaginamos<br>
Só tô vendendo esse Hi-Tech porque não tenho o Actavis (Yeah)<br>
Eu tô tentando ser modesto (Modesto), parece que tô me gabando (Me gabando)<br>
Cartier nos meus óculos (Óculos), tudo por causa da minha fama (Fama)<br>
Essa vadia disse que tem vergonha de me amar em público, (Público) prefere ficar no privado (Vi o suficiente)<br>

[Verso 3: SZA &amp; <i>Travis Scott</i>]<br>
Eu não me canso, te falei que eu simplesmente quero tudo<br>
Eu não me canso, você não tem feito o suficiente (<i>Você gosta do jeito que soa?</i>)<br>
Tão frio, tão frio, é tão frio, tão frio, tão frio<br>
Você pode ver o futuro, existe um brilho nos seus olhos<br>
Por que você está na minha coxa? Não te posso deixar<br>
Esses caras planejam a minha morte, eu tenho assassinato na minha mente<br>
Eu tenho dinheiro na linha, não posso perder mesmo se eu tentasse<br>
Não deixo nenhuma vadia atrapalhar meu passo<br>
Escolhida, eu vou apostar em mim<br>
Escolhida, todas as minhas coisas e dentes<br>
Vadias e eu não aguento nenhum calor<br>
Diamantes dançando em mim<br>
Você está começando do zero, cara, você está fora de si<br>
Você transou com aquela garota que conheceu na festa<br>
Eu tenho alguns caras novos no saguão<br>
Como eu posso dormir quando você está caçando corpos?<br>
Eu ainda quero estar com você, confie em mim, eu sei que isso é loucura<br>
Eu prefiro transar com você do que transar com fracotes<br>
Eu fiz uma merda em Berlim, meu moldae<br>
Nós dois não somos nada e isso está funcionando pra mim<br>
Funcionando pra mim, yeah<br>
Eu pude ver o futuro, eu pude ver o futuro</p>

I made a name, it's global (It's global), my enemy pass over (Hey)<br>
I took the way to the top (Top), I had to learn to be smart (Smart)<br>
I had to move with my heart, keepin' my eyes on the part<br>
'Cause it get evil and dark (Evil and dark)<br>
When it come to my opponents<br>
I know how to beat 'em, I know to defeat 'em (Hey)<br>
Livin' my life by the moment<br>
Somebody callin', somebody gon' need 'em<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Swae Lee]<br>
I just came to my senses (Yeah)<br>
I stay in another dimension<br>
Fear is non-existent (Existent)<br>
Suit up and swing through the city (Ooh, hey)<br>
Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (Afraid)<br>
I'm in my own world, give me space<br>
I'm in my own universe, give me space (Space, yeah)<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Swae Lee]<br>
Okay, we bounce and shake, we roll and rock<br>
I got to set it straight, the block is hot<br>
Something's come over me, I hit unlock<br>
And tell my enemies, ""I'll never stop""<br>
No, no, nothing can shake me now<br>
Tell the block I made it now<br>
Yeah, the whole town is talking out<br>
I swear, nothing can stop me now<br>
All this, boosting all my senses<br>
I won't start, but I finished<br>
I shoot my shot, bet I won't miss it<br>
Only way to go is go the distance<br>
Nothing can shake me now<br>
Nothing can break me down<br>
Tell the whole town, we popping now<br>
Nothing can shake me now<br>

Pero pusieron la canción, eh, eh, eh<br>
Que cantamo’ bien borracho'<br>

[Verso 1: J Balvin]<br>
Justo cuando creía<br>
Que por comerme a do’ o diez, te olvidaría' (Yeh)<br>
Cogí un respiro y me salí de la vía<br>
Y como un pendejo, no sabía lo que hacía<br>
Nunca lo superé, nunca te superé (No; no)<br>
Hasta me aprendí to'a la' balada’ en inglé' (Yeh)<br>
Respiré y conté hasta tres (Uno, dos, tres)<br>

¿A que guió solo?<br>

[Estribillo: J Balvin &amp; <i>Bad Bunny</i>]<br>

<br>
[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]<br>
Y hace tiempo que no venía' a mi cabeza<br>
Pero ya van par de cerveza'<br>
Y me acordé de cómo tú me besa'<br>
De to' lo' polvo' encima 'e la mesa<br>
Y en el carro, la playa, y el motel<br>
En casa de tu pai', cuando yo te iba a ver<br>
Las vece' que tu mai' no' llegó a coger<br>
Tú brincando mojaíta', sudando Chanel<br>
Yo sé que lo nuestro e' cosa de ayer<br>
Y me pone contento que te va bien con él<br>
Yo ni te extrañaba ni te quería ver<br>
Pero pusieron la canción que te gustaba poner<br>
Y me acordé de ti, cuando me hiciste feliz<br>
Se acabó, pues, me fui, ey<br>
Yo mismo me río de mí porque—<br>

Pa' curarme las heridas, Catarina con saliva, así no siento nada<br>

No sé qué estarás pensando, si me estarás extrañando<br>
Ni de mí te has de acordar<br>

Pero ni así se mе da<br>
La gente me ha preguntado sobre ti, que qué ha pasado<br>
Y no les quiero contestar<br>

Made a buck off my soul<br>
I've been singing stories to the crowd<br>

"<p>Woman: From the campus of the Wharton School in San Francisco, this is Startup School Radio. Here is Y Combinator partner Aaron Harris.<br>
Aaron: Good morning and welcome to Startup School Radio, live from the Wharton School in San Francisco, on Sirius XM's Business Radio, powered by the Wharton School. I'm your host, Aaron Harris. I'm a partner at Y Combinator, where we fund early stage companies and work with them to help make them into billion dollar businesses. Every year, Y Combinator does a startup conference called Startup School, where we bring great founders that we really love and have them tell their stories, everything they've learned, from the screw-ups to the successes and everything in between. Here on Startup School Radio, we'll be bringing those founders to you on a weekly basis. We broadcast every Wednesday at 1 PM Eastern, 10 AM Pacific with the goal of helping anyone who's thinking about starting a company learn how to do it better.<br>
Coming up on today's show, PlanGrid's founders Ryan Sutton-Gee, Tracy Young, and Ralph Gootee talk with me about their story and how they created an incredible app that lets construction companies store blueprints and documents on their computers and on their mobile devices. Plus, later, we'll hear from recent grads of our winter 2015 batch, Liz Wessel and J.J. Fliegelman, co-founders of Campus Job. We'll talk with them about their YC experience, what they've learned and how they're putting it into action now they're out in the real world.<br>
If you're thinking about starting a company, or you're an entrepreneur in the early stages of running a startup and have a question for us, we'd love to hear from you. Our number is 844-Wharton, that's 844-942-7866 and be sure to follow our channel on Twitter, @bizradio111, or follow me on Twitter, @Harris. So, let's get going. I'm very happy to welcome my first guests, Tracy Young, Ryan Sutton-Gee and Ralph Gootee from PlanGrid. Thanks so much for joining us, everyone.<br>
Tracy: Thanks for having us. It's great to be here.<br>
Aaron: So, you're all part of YC's winter batch in 2012. So, you've been out for three years now. That's kind of a while.<br>
Tracy: Yeah, it's really strange how time goes by in a startup world.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. When did you found the company initially?<br>
Ryan: It's kind of funny. We actually sort of founded the company twice, in a weird sort of way, so originally . . .<br>
Aaron: You'll have to explain that one.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, we had the original idea, we actually it was just the three of us. There's actually four founders, Kenny Stone, who can't make it isn't here. We originally founded the company not knowing about Y Combinator and incorporating in California and kind of had a false start and we did a lot of great work but didn't really get our legal structure in place until later in the year, when we heard about Y Combinator and then we got together with the original four founders and applied then.<br>
But the basic story of how PlanGrid came about was really because myself and Tracy, we were both construction field workers, construction project engineers and Tracy came to me one day with this huge invoice for--<br>
Aaron: What? Sorry. I realize I don't even know, what actually is a Construction Project Engineer?<br>
Tracy: Yeah, so we're engineers on a job site with hard hats and muddy boots, safety vests, safety glasses and we're basically responsible for delivering the building on time and literally translating what's on the blueprints onto the actual structure in the field.<br>
Aaron: So, are you guiding the workers on the site, or you're actually hopping in the back hoe loaders and the cranes and operating them yourselves?<br>
Tracy: Right. So, we're not physically building the building with our bare hands, but we manage the day to day workflow of the job site, making sure that materials are delivered on time, making sure that everyone's safe.<br>
Aaron: So, basically pretty close to my dream job when I was a small child. Get to like hang out on construction sites with big equipment and see the whole thing go together.<br>
Tracy: Something like that.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, pretty much. Basically, a Construction Project Engineer is someone with typically a civil engineering or construction managing degree that gets to help direct, yeah, the big equipment and gets to see something go from dirt to building.<br>
Aaron: Got it. So, you were both working as Construction Project Engineers. How the hell do you go from there to starting a startup? That seems pretty far from the standard construction business.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. I mean, basically what happened is that, one thing is that, as an individual, I went to Sac State with Tracy and studied Construction Management. Then I went to Stanford, when I did my masters in civil engineering there. And we have a lot of friends that are sort of in tech and doing startups and so I always knew I wanted to start a company of some kind, and then once--<br>
Aaron: Did you initially think it was going to be a construction firm or an engineering firm?<br>
Ryan: You know, it was kind of not, I hadn't really decided. It sort of, probably in my original plan was basically to do a construction firm, right, start a construction company, but if you're a young, tech savvy person like me and Tracy are and you work in construction industry and you're in the field, it doesn't take very long for you to notice that there's a lot of efficiencies that could be made, especially with technology. So, I remember like the iPad came out, when it was first released, and I got one for Christmas present, I think or a birthday present, I don't remember, and then the first thing I did was I brought it to work and I was like, ""Hey guys, check this out. Maybe I can put plans on here."" And it was just literally impossible to do so, and yet at the same time--<br>
Aaron: We're talking blueprints?<br>
Ryan: Yeah, yeah.<br>
Aaron: These massive . . . How big is the average blueprint? How many feet by . . .<br>
Tracy: It's a 42 inches by 30 inches.<br>
Aaron: And that's a standard size for blueprints?<br>
Tracy: Yeah.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. That doesn't fit. I mean the blueprint, I mean, the iPad screen is what, 10 inch diagonal or something like that, so . . .<br>
Ryan: Yeah. Well, what's even funnier is the standard for blueprints, for whatever reason, is PDFs, right? Those are meant to be printed, which is like not--<br>
Ralph: And you need special printers for this.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, and it's a terrible file format. So when you load it on to PDF reader on the iPad, it would crash the OS, actually, it was so bad. But, at the same time, you open up Google Maps and you can stream the planet off the internet on that thing. So, I knew it was possible to do that and when I brought it to Tracy, we had dinner one day and, by the way, I'm always pitching silly startup ideas to her, and her job was basically--<br>
Tracy: Ryan actually convinced me to start a company with him when I was 18, and--<br>
Aaron: So you guys have known each other for a long time?<br>
Tracy: Yeah, my freshman year of college and he had pitched me, you know, hundreds of ideas over, like, six years and blueprints on iPad was the one that I agreed to. I said--<br>
Aaron: What did you turn down before that?<br>
Tracy: Oh, my gosh! I don't know. They were all crazy, they were all crazy. Do you remember?<br>
Ryan: Well, there were some construction firm ideas, which I could talk for an hour as to why it's a really bad idea to found a construction firm. And so I try to find niches within that sort of field that wouldn't make us be personally bankrupt. But luckily, we have Tracy because the first one she said yes to turned out to work out pretty well, so it all worked out. But, yeah, if I remember right, like, I told her this idea. Usually, she'd shoot me down, like that's impractical for this reason or whatever, but instead she, literally that week I think, it was that week that you had to pay that giant invoice for the blueprints.<br>
Tracy: Yeah, yeah. So, I had accidentally ordered blueprints for folks that weren't exactly on my team, but I was being the nice guy and I got a bill for $27,000.<br>
Aaron: Whoa!<br>
Tracy: And I'm a new working engineer and I had no idea how I was going to pay for this. So, I told Ryan and, Ryan, do you remember what you said to me?<br>
Ryan: Yeah, I was like . . .<br>
Tracy: I remember this really well.<br>
Ryan: Holy shit! How can plans cost that much money? I had no idea.<br>
Aaron: How many plans was that?<br>
Tracy: It was only like 15 sets of plans in color.<br>
Aaron: Wow.<br>
Tracy: They're very, very expensive.<br>
Aaron: $27,000? And that's because, I mean, it's a special printer, it's special ink, it's special paper and I'm guessing it's kind of a monopoly business?<br>
Tracy: Mm-hmm.<br>
Aaron: Wow!<br>
Ryan: Yeah, to a certain extent it is. Also, it's just an enormous amount of paper. She was on this Kaiser Hospital. It was Kaiser San Leandro at the time and there's just so much paper. It's like 15,000 sheets to describe one hospital. It's not even a big hospital. It's a good size hospital, but it's just an enormous amount of paper.<br>
Aaron: Just to give me a sense, because I think of hospitals, I don't know how big that hospital is. For a house, 2,000 square foot house or something, how many pages of blueprints or pages of paper are we talking about?<br>
Tracy: [inaudible 00:08:32] have like 40 sheets of blueprints but then, if you change any walls, you change any doors, that's like an extra 10 sheets at a time.<br>
Aaron: And so the way this worked traditionally is basic then, the architect or the engineer would have to go in, change it, there's software to make these things and then reprint everything.<br>
Tracy: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: Wow! Okay. That sounds super inefficient.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. And then, to make it even crazier, just imagine, you know, you've got a hospital takes over a large part of, it's a large area. You've got, easily, 100 people working on it simultaneously. They can't come back to the trailer every time they need to look at plans. So, they've got separate copies of these paper sets and so, every time there's a change, it's not just, you have to print it out. You have to print it out and track those guys down, find their set, take it away from them, like screw in the new version.<br>
Aaron: So, Ryan, you see this huge inefficiency happening and you're like, ""Oh, I got this iPad thing. What if we could stick the blueprints inside the iPad. Was that basically the way, Tracy is that what he came to you with?<br>
Tracy: Yeah, yeah. He, in so many words, he says, ""It's 2010. It should be in the cloud and we should be able to view it on our mobile device.""<br>
Aaron: And you said?<br>
Tracy: And I said, ""Yeah, let's do it."" And so, we go to our good friend Antoine Hersen at the time, and he also went to Sacramento State, studying his masters in computer science and we said, ""Hey, you wanna join our startup?"" And he says, ""That's a great idea. You guys should learn how to program.""<br>
Aaron: Good advice.<br>
Tracy: We actually didn't learn how to program. We instead met like every week for, we met every week to work on the business plan and the wireframes of what was called Peanuts at that time.<br>
Aaron: Was that copyright infringement on the cartoon strip?<br>
Ryan: No. It's just, we were working for nothing, so we had [inaudible 00:10:18] in the document. Yeah.<br>
Aaron: I like it.<br>
Ryan: Yeah.<br>
Tracy: And then, at that time, I was dating this man named Ralph Gootee, and we were having dinner and our relationship was at a point where we're going steady, and we're sharing Google calendars together, and do you remember what you said to me, Ralph?<br>
Ralph: Why is there re-occurring event every Thursday with you and Ryan called Peanuts?<br>
Tracy: Four hours every Thursday night.<br>
Ralph: All kinds of conspiracy theories running through your head.<br>
Tracy: And so, I told him about Peanuts and what it was and his reaction, do you remember what you said to me?<br>
Ralph: At the time, I was a rendering engineer at Pixar, aspiring to be an iOS developer and I said, ""Do you know who I am? Do you know what I do as a job? Do you know I write iPad apps? Why have you not told me about this?""<br>
Tracy: And I said, ""Hey, you wanna join?""<br>
Ralph: Yeah. She said, ""Do you want to join for 30% of the company?"" So, she shafted me 3%, right from the get go.<br>
Aaron: That is harsh.<br>
Ralph: I should have known she would--<br>
Aaron: And your relationship survived that moment?<br>
Ralph: Absolutely.<br>
Tracy: But Ralph said yes and he said, ""Actually, can I be CTO?"" And everyone was like, yeah.<br>
Aaron: That makes sense.<br>
Tracy: And when Ryan found out that I shafted Ralph 3.33%, he quickly fixed that.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. So, originally, it was the three of us, a third, a third, a third, as I kind of mentioned in the beginning, and then, you know, later Antoine more formally joined us, rather than just yelling at us for not knowing how to program, which, you know, was not the worst advice at the time. And then we decided that the best path forward was to, you know, apply to Y Combinator.<br>
Aaron: I got to take a second just to explore something that actually seems so crazy. We just kind of passed over it, but Tracy, the fact that you and Ralph were dating and Ralph just happened to be the exact kind of engineer, the exact kind of a hacker that you needed to build this thing is one of those serendipitous moments that you can't plan. And it's something that I think that a lot of people, when they think about startups, are like, ""Oh, it's just about this or it's just about that."" But like these bits of luck, it's luck, really, are so important and while you can't really plan to have them, you can plan to be ready for them and it sounds like you totally were. If you had been like, ""Ah, you got to stop this Peanut thing with this crazy guy. That sounds like a terrible idea. I'm a Pixar engineer."" You could've said that. I mean, it would have been the wrong thing to say but, like everything kind of came together in a perfect way, which is, I don't know, kind of one of those unbelievable stories that's true. You couldn't write that and people would believe it.<br>
Ralph: Yeah. I mean, there's actually a lot of these incidences, I think, in PlanGrid story. I mean, one, the fact that I met Tracy. I would've just been some like [inaudible 00:13:05] spitting out startup ideas, have I not had this amazing editor and, later, leader of the company that I had just had, we just happened to have a personal connection, be friends. But even how I heard about Y Combinator is kind of a funny story. It's that, you know, I was at Stanford doing my masters in civil engineering and I was going through it really quickly. I did it in three quarters, so I didn't have a lot . . .<br>
Aaron: And while you're doing that, Tracy you're working on sites and Ralph, you're at Pixar, right?<br>
Ralph: Right. And then, literally I had, on a whim, signed up from some entrepreneurship club bases, which is actually a great thing, though I only ever went to one meeting, which is what I'm about to tell you about, and they had a last minute cancellation of a driver to go on a field trip to this thing called Y Combinator and I had no idea what it was, and so, I'm like bored on a Saturday. I'm like, sure, I'll drive people and I show up in my car. We drive down to Pioneer Way, I get out there and there's like 12 of us and Y Combinator isn't that famous then, and so Paul Graham personally . . .<br>
Aaron: This is in 2013?<br>
Ralph: No, this in 2010, no, no, no this is like in 20 . . .<br>
Tracy: 2008, 2009.<br>
Aaron: Oh, wow. So, this is, yeah... No one knew who we were. Yeah and so the building, by the way, is super unimpressive, if you don't know what it is. It's just like an empty room most of the time. There aren't really people around very frequently.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, exactly. I was not that impressed. I go in there, what's going on? Paul Graham comes out. He's this guy in shorts and Berks and he just, he blows my mind with his standard startup lecture where he does the graph on the wall with the trough of despair and the Tech Crunch initiation and whatnot.<br>
Aaron: Trough of sorrow.<br>
Ryan: And then I forget my bag on the way out, and he comes chasing after me with it. And that was how I first heard about Y Combinator was by accident from Paul Graham himself, basically, and three year, four years later, we're there interviewing with him for PlanGrid.<br>
Aaron: If you're just joining us, I'm Aaron Harris and you're listening to Startup School Radio. I'm talking with the co-founders of PlanGrid, who were just telling us some of the bits about how luck influenced the path of their company, right down from founding it to finding co-founders to even hearing about Y Combinator, which is a crazy set of coincidences, really, that kinda start leading you on the path. So, Ryan, you were just saying, okay, so you happened upon YC basically, met PG, Paul Graham. You're already talking about Peanuts with Tracy, right? You guys are already doing these meetings. Are you guys full time on this or it's still just a part time thing, right, 'cuz you're in school, Ryan's in school, Tracy's working and Ralph's working?<br>
Tracy: Mm-hmm. We were just working on it in the evenings, as a second job.<br>
Aaron: So Tracy, when do you get to the point where you decide, okay, screw our other jobs, screw the other things we're doing. This is what we want to do full time?<br>
Tracy: Yeah. So, our co-founder, Antoine Hersen, who joined on the condition that he would be Chief Mad Scientist, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer at 27 and I think it was sort of a life changing moment, learning that. We realized that our time here is not that long and in fact it's very short and so we might as well do something that we really love. And, at that point, Ralph and I quit our jobs, we took a train over to Chicago where Antoine was at, and we hung out with him and Peanuts was one thing we worked on and Ralph and Antoine actually worked on several games together. Do you want to talk more about that?<br>
Ralph: Yeah. I mean, it was a lot of fun taking off, not having to actually do a full time job and just kind of working on whatever we felt like. And one of the projects that we worked on that really pulled ahead was, of course, what would eventually become PlanGrid. Initially, when I started working on the problem, I thought, okay, no problem. I'll throw a PDF on an iPad. That's pretty standard stuff, honestly. So, I wrote the first prototype and it pretty much failed, like everything else out there with the iPad 1. It ran out of memory, it was slow, it was chunky and, through my experiences working with graphics, I'm actually a 2D graphic specialist, I made it a lot faster but it took a lot of time, took months and kind of seeing the product come into existence was one thing that really pulled me to work on something new, to work on something challenging that no one else had even done before. But the games with Antoine were actually a whole lot of fun.<br>
Aaron: I think this is something that a lot of people don't realize. Two things. One, the importance of just hacking on random stuff, the idea that you're not just working on PlanGrid at the time, you're working on other things, which kind of let's your mind sort of experience different things and, also, you don't know what's actually gonna be the thing. So, that's one thing, just that importance of experimenting and just building stuff, putting it out there and seeing what happens, but I think the thing that's also really crazy for me is there are a lot of people, like you said, who tried to put PDFs on iPads and you could've said, ""Look, the only thing you need to do to put blueprints on an iPad and make that a thing is just have a good PDF browser structure, a file structure, and just have your PDFs there."" But it doesn't work and that's why this is hard and that's why this is a real problem.<br>
Ralph: We actually, when I worked at Pixar, I worked on version control of large scale artist images so . . .<br>
Aaron: Which means what?<br>
Ralph: Basically, every bit of art that's done at Pixar is incredibly valuable and it changes constantly over time. So, they use them for references, artists will look at old versions of Woody from Toy Story 1 to make Toy Story 2 and those versions, there's a lot of these versions lying around, but one thing that they did very well was they didn't think about these pieces of art as files in a file system. They thought of them, more generically, as pieces of art that can be tagged and filtered in different ways. And this was the first thing we approached with PlanGrid as well. 'Cuz PlanGrid, we service the construction industry which doesn't necessarily mean they're super tech savvy, so to say. So, the dealing with files is actually a huge amount of complication for people. Even knowing what a PDF file is beyond a lot of people in the industry sometimes. So, as soon as you start dealing with files, you bring this whole structure with you, rather than just dealing with the blueprints like they were used to.<br>
Aaron: That's kind of crazy to think about, right? I mean, a blueprint as a piece of art, effectively, right? It's drawings on a page.<br>
Ralph: That's right.<br>
Aaron: And that idea of version control, it's something that makes sense to most of us, I think, when you think about a Word doc. You edit a Word doc, over time, you save different versions, or in Excel. That makes sense. I think, to most people but when it's lines on a page, it's harder to think about, I think, unless you have that unique experience of watching it happen at a place like Pixar, where then you can translate that over. So, I don't know, going back to that luck/serendipity thing, like, would anyone else have thought of that? No one else did, so.<br>
Ralph: I was pretty surprised by the luck as well, considering I had worked on a very similar problem before and also was an aspiring iOS programmer, writing kind of silly iOS apps that weren't really getting the traction I wanted.<br>
Aaron: And those are the games or other things as well?<br>
Ralph: I hesitate to mention many of them. Thankfully, this was back in iOS 3, iOS 4, so, thankfully, they've all been--<br>
Tracy: You should definitely download Hacker Typer.<br>
Ralph: No.<br>
Aaron: Hacker Typer. All right, we'll have to look it up. All right, so the two you are in Chicago and Ryan's still at Stanford. So, Tracy, what happens? Like, when do you actually come together and say, we're going? Because you're there, you're in Chicago with Antoine, so when do you actually start PlanGrid as PlanGrid and--<br>
Tracy: Yeah, yeah. So, it was Antoine and Ryan's dream to get into Y Combinator and applications opened up. We spent hours, like, just writing and re-writing our application. We were trying to input like all kinds of clever jokes into there. We really wanted to make the partners laugh and, like, let us into one of the interviews, and we were just, we were travelling by then and we get an email from Paul Graham. I don't remember exactly what, but do you remember Ryan?<br>
Ryan: Yeah. So, it's actually funny. So, we submit the application and we submit it through Hacker News, if you guys aren't familiar, it's like the startup Reddit, so to speak. But, in there, they have this system where you can have a message sent to you through Hacker News and it's clearly only used for startup applicants, 'cuz it's really rare and hard to find.<br>
Aaron: Basically, when you log into, when you go to Hacker News, there's a lot of news stories and if you've gotten a message about your application, there's just a little banner at the top of the page that you could pretty easily have missed that says, hey, you have a message.<br>
Ryan: And you don't get an email or anything so . . .<br>
Aaron: it's one of the most exciting things. It was a big step, by the way. You get an email now.<br>
Ryan: Well, at the time, there was just this line that was like, check regularly. So, you guys turned me into a Hacker News addict. I was just like checking it, like, every 30 seconds. And one day, I get a message back and it's like a one line question from Paul Graham. I don't even remember what the question was but it was like, ""How is this gonna be a real business?"" And I write a response really, we actually, I wake them up. They're, like, in Spain or something, at this point.<br>
Ralph: I remember the question.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. What was it?<br>
Ralph: The question was, ""How do you plan on getting past the barriers of IT departments with B to B, because normally the IT departments are the things blocking you from rolling out to large projects, and you're just going to be stopped at the gate."" It was a very good question, honestly.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. Which is, you know, it's one of these funny things because, you know, Paul Graham is not particularly an expert on the construction industry, but he's seen enough companies and he knows how these things work, that that's a super insightful question, because that's the barrier. Well, okay, you can design software. That's the first part of the challenge. It's getting it into people's hands and getting them using it. So, what was your answer?<br>
Tracy: The projects control their own destiny. They're going to buy whatever software that's . . .<br>
Aaron: It's an almost mystical statement.<br>
Tracy: Okay, all right. So, construction projects have their own budgets.<br>
Aaron: Interesting.<br>
Tracy: And so, a superintendent on a project can make the decision. If it's a tool that will help him or her deliver the project on time and on schedule, they will purchase that tool. And so, we don't have to talk to IT people.<br>
Aaron: Right. It's just a one person, so if a project engineer loves you, done. They'll buy the software.<br>
Tracy: Mm-hmm.<br>
Ryan: Right.<br>
Ralph: I would like to add that we love IT people now. They're great. If any IT people are listening, they're our favorite people.<br>
Ryan: They just take a little longer to convince than a superintendent who wants a new kind of hammer. Yeah, so, anyways, we answered that question and I assumed that we're going to get the same notification that we've got an interview through that same system, which turns out, I don't know, maybe you do now, but at that time, you don't and so I would refresh Hacker News 10 times a day for about a month or however long. . .<br>
Aaron: Come on, 10 times a day? More than that.<br>
Ryan: Like 50, yeah. Like, literally every waking moment. Anyways, eventually get an email, I think, from one of the partners. Maybe it was Paul Graham himself, but we got invited to the interview round, and so, which was like one of the most exciting and frightening things ever. And I remember getting the email and calling Tracy and Ralph, waking them up when they're somewhere in Europe, and then we go to the interview, eventually, at the same place where I saw Paul Graham. I asked him if he remembered me. Of course, he did not, and then--<br>
Aaron: Not, by the way, not something to take personally.<br>
Ryan: Right. No, I didn't. And then, in the interview, it was the four of us, with Antoine there, and it was like this blur. We had prepped so long for that interview. I think we had this list of 20 questions that we thought we would get asked and we drilled them over and over again, and then none of them got asked.<br>
Aaron: So, the interviews for YC are about 10 minutes long, and they sometimes go off on wild tangents but what we're always trying to get at is how you think about your business and how it's going to be that that huge business that P.G. was asking you about. Do you remember?<br>
Ralph: I do. Yeah. I remember the first question that was asked. We walked in, we sat down and P.G. immediately asked, I have a friend that's an architect and--<br>
Aaron: Probably Kate.<br>
Ryan: I don't know who he was referring to. I have a friend that's an architect and she says that paper plans are never going out of style. You can't see these things on blueprints. Papers the way that people want to interact with this. And we were just so ready for that question, surprisingly, even though it was a tough question, the toughest question that you could be asked. So, normally, when I talk to other people interested in YC, I always tell them to be just prepared for the worst question possible.<br>
Aaron: It's funny. It's both the worst question and, again, probably the most important thing, right, is what is the sort of starting energy cost? How do you overcome the inertia of an industry to fundamentally change it?<br>
Ralph: Do you guys remember how we answered it?<br>
Tracy: Oh yeah, of course. I mean, we had planned for this.<br>
Ralph: It was awesome.<br>
Tracy: So, I had a set of blueprints with me and I flip it open, and they both have an iPad, I think. Ryan has an iPad and he's trying to pull up a blueprint on Adobe Acrobat and a dialog box comes up and it says, out of memory and then, at the same time, Ralph has the beta in his hand, of PlanGrid at the time, and he's like, ""Can you see this?""<br>
Ryan: Oh, actually, you tried to show Paul Graham the blueprints as well, and those things are like eight point fonts on a 42 by 30 inch page. It's incredible.<br>
Aaron: So, you've got to zoom in all the way just to see it?<br>
Ryan: Exactly. So, she just showed him, from a distance, can you read this? And he's like, no. Bam! And then we zoom into the exact same spot.<br>
Aaron: Drop the blueprints and the iPad, walk out of the room.<br>
Ryan: More or less.<br>
Ralph: We had 10 minutes of intense growing grilling or something like that in between, b--<br>
Aaron: Yeah, I don't remember. I remember the first 30 seconds of my interview and I remember like one or two questions that got asked and that's pretty much it. All right. We clearly didn't get through remotely all of the PlanGrid story. We kind of had to scratch the surface on the beginning of the founding, so I'm going to demand that you guys come back as a group and talk through the rest of it, if you're cool with that. Because this is the first step in what's been a pretty awesome journey that isn't remotely done yet and I know there's a lot there for people to learn from.<br>
If you're just tuning in, I'm Aaron Harris. I've been speaking with Ryan, Tracy and Ralph of PlanGrid. Just ahead, Ryan's gonna stick with us as we're joined by Liz Wessel and J.J.

Woman: You're listening to Startup School Radio, powered by the Wharton School. Here again is Aaron Harris.<br>
Aaron: Welcome back to Startup School Radio on Business Radio, powered by the Wharton School, Sirius XM channel 111. I'm your host, Aaron Harris, a partner at Y Combinator. I've been speaking this half hour or this hour with the founders of PlanGrid and Ryan is back with us for the second half hour. Thanks for sticking with us, Ryan.<br>
Ryan: So happy to be here.<br>
Aaron: We're now joined by my next guests, Liz Wessel and J.J. Fliegelman, the co-founders of Campus Job. Campus Job is an online marketplace for college students to find jobs and internships while they're in school. And Liz and J.J. finished up Y Combinators winter 2015 batch just last week. They're here to talk about Campus Job, their YC experience, what they've learned, what they're going to do next as they fly back across the country. Thank you both for coming in today.<br>
Liz: Thank you for having us.<br>
J.J.: It's good to be here, Aaron.<br>
Aaron: If you're thinking of starting a company or you're an entrepreneur in the early stages of running a startup and have a question for us, we'd love to hear from you. Our number is 844-Wharton, that's 844-942-7866. You can also follow us on Twitter, @BizRadio111, or follow me, @Harris. So Liz, J.J., first of all, you're both Penn grads?<br>
Liz: Correct.<br>
J.J.: Yap.<br>
Aaron: And we're in Wharton's campus in San Francisco.<br>
Liz: Proud to be here.<br>
Aaron: Good job. Good job, Wharton, good job Penn, making such great founders for Y Combinator to fund. I want to start, as I normally do, of just talking a little bit about where Campus Job came from. You're both fairly recent college grads. I think you're, are you both two or three years out?<br>
Liz: Three and four years.<br>
Aaron: Three and four years out. Okay, not too far removed from college, building something for colleges. Did Campus Job come from, like, have you wanted to do this since college, or what happened that you decided to start this company?<br>
Liz: Yeah. So, J.J. and I actually became close friends during college because we, along with a few other friends, decided to start a company that was kind of the inspiration for what Campus Job is today. So, that company was a much more niche version. We didn't even call it a company. It was more of a side project, but it was something we worked on our senior year of college. We built it, we graduated and it started to take off after we graduated.<br>
Aaron: What was it?<br>
Liz: It was basically a job board for campus rep opportunities. So, like everything from Microsoft, to Group Me campus reps to NGO campus reps, etc.<br>
<br>
Aaron: So, these are the students who will wear a Red Bull t-shirt around campus, hand out free Red Bull and get frats to join.<br>
Liz: Exactly, exactly.<br>
J.J.: The most popular kids on campus.<br>
Aaron: They got free stuff to give. Everyone loves free stuff, especially college kids.<br>
Liz: Exactly. So, we saw a big need for startups looking for students to hire and for students looking for marketing jobs on campus, so we started that side project in college. It started to really take off and, over a few years, when we were doing nothing related to it, and really had our own full time jobs, we decided to use the inspiration from what that side project was and actually quit our jobs at Google and McKenzie and start Campus Job and go big for all jobs for college students.<br>
Aaron: This is one of those decisions that's like every mother's nightmare. My son and daughter quit their jobs at Google and at McKenzie, two of the best companies to work at in the world, to go do something crazy, like start a company where they're not going to get paid and probably starve to death. So, what was it about this idea that made you leave such comfortable careers?<br>
J.J.: Well, I think for me, there were two things. One was even just this side project that Liz was just talking about, seeing that traction grow while we were doing nothing was really inspiring and also helped us realize that there was something there. Imagine if we really put effort into it and really, really made it work. It could be huge. Then, for me, the second piece was, honestly, working with Liz. I hope she's not going to be blushing right now, but I believed in her and I believed in us and a team and, for me, that was what made me reach out to her, as I was coming towards realizing I want to leave and do something big and I wanted to do with her.<br>
Liz: The feeling is very mutual, and then I will also say, we kinda figured if we were going to do this idea, which we knew we wanted to do, now was the time because we're close enough to college age, where we still know what the big problems are and how to tackle them and so, we're risk takers and Google and Mackenzie, we can always go back to them if we needed to, but I think Campus Job now, even better place to work, so we're happy.<br>
J.J.: We were talking to, just talking about the role of luck in the founding of startups, where Ryan's co-founders, Tracy and Ralph, were dating. Tracy was an engineer on construction sites and Ralph just happened to be an engineer focused on graphics and version control at Pixar and they said, well, we want to do something with blueprints and he's like, I'm the perfect guy to do that. So, I don't know, Ryan, if you're listening to this story of two people who happen to be friends in college, who happened to start something that happened to grow while they were away from it. If you're having like, oh my God, it's all luck.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm sure only part of it is serendipity but I think also that people that like to work on big problems. I like to believe, this is probably sort of silly, that they just naturally are attracted to one another. Sometimes in a romantic sense like Ralph and Tracy, but in this case, not so much, but just they're kindred spirits. So, risk takers, I think, maybe just sort of find each other.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
Liz: I will mention, by the way, we actually didn't become friends before the side project. I actually stalked him because I went through--<br>
Aaron: Now it's getting a little creepy, but all right.<br>
Liz: I looked, I hacked into the Hackathon database of hackers at Penn and I went through every resume of the hackers at Penn and only one stood out as being the person I had to work with on this side project, and it was J.J. And so I emailed him and . . .<br>
Aaron: Now J.J.'s blushing, by the way.<br>
J.J.: I get this email out nowhere from some girl Liz Wessel and she's like, ""Hey, we have a lot of friends in common who told me that we should meet,"" and I'm like on Facebook. I'm like, ""We have no friends in common. Who are you?""<br>
Aaron: Maybe very little serendipity in this case.<br>
Liz: But it worked out.<br>
Aaron: Not serendipity at all, totally manufactured meeting. All right, that is one of the best, best stories of founders meeting that I've heard in a while. Okay, so, all right. Liz, you hunt J.J. down, you guys build this side project in college, but it's not enough of a thing to get you to do it right in college, right?<br>
Liz: Yeah. I mean, our plan was literally to do it and then graduate and go on to our own, other careers. It was always just a side project.<br>
Aaron: Why?<br>
J.J.: I think we both did it because we were approaching the end of college. We knew we had a limited amount of time to do something totally crazy before we went on to do ""real people things.""<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
J.J.: This was a great opportunity to do something really, really cool that we wouldn't have time for later.<br>
Liz: Also, I think the funny thing is, it didn't, like, take off or anything while we were in college. It was after we stopped doing anything and touching it that, all of the sudden, we graduate, forget it exists, and it just starts to grow.<br>
Aaron: This is like the super fascinating thing about startups and kind of the heart of Y Combinator's motto, which is make something people want. It's make something people want that they're gonna want, even if you're not shoving it down their throats.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: Reddit's also a really good example of this, in a lot of ways. Alexis and Steve found it and they work really hard on growing its initial user base. Then, they sell it, and they're not working on it full time. No one's really working on it full time, aside from maintaining it and it just grows and grows over time and then, now it's a behemoth and people are working on it really hard and have been for a few years. But, when you make something that people actually really want, they find it and they use it and they continue to use it, as long as it doesn't break. J.J. how much time were you spending on it in sort of the intervening years, just to make sure the thing stayed up?<br>
J.J.: Shockingly little, like, embarrassingly little.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
J.J.: But there just wasn't, there wasn't much to do.<br>
Aaron: It was just a job board.<br>
J.J.: Very simple site, job board, didn't look that great, to be totally honest.<br>
Aaron: Right.<br>
J.J. And people just signed up.<br>
Liz: Just to be clear, Campus Job is not a job board.<br>
J.J.: Campus Job looks great and it's a marketplace.<br>
Liz: It looks great.<br>
Aaron: It is, in fact, quite beautiful.<br>
J.J.: Oh, thank you.<br>
Aaron: So, all right. So, this niche, what was the original thing called?<br>
Liz: The Campus Rep.<br>
Aaron: The Campus Rep, going to the Campus Job. I like how you did that.<br>
Liz: And then we dropped the ""the,"" in a Facebook matter.<br>
Aaron: Yeah, exactly. So, it's just Campus Job. I like the progression. Pretty soon, it'll just be Campus.<br>
J.J.: Or just Job.<br>
Aaron: Or just Job, or Job. So, you both leave your jobs because you think that this thing actually has legs. It's growing without you doing anything. You say, you know what? This is our chance. We have a little bit of money in the bank. We can take this risk. It's a chance to do it. What happens next?<br>
Liz: So, we actually, we decided to shut down the Campus Rep because it was so different than anything we pictured could be the correct way to approach the problem, the bigger problem of all campus jobs and internships. So, we shut down the Campus Rep and we e-mailed all those users once and said, ""We'll never bother you again, but there's this new website in town, CampusJob.com. We recommend you check it out.""<br>
Aaron: How many people were on that email list?<br>
Liz: A couple, like, several thousand that didn't bounce back, because a lot of students had probably graduated, etc. So, we had a little bump. So, I actually had been working at Google in India, moved back from India July 1st, quit Google July 15th. J.J. was working full time on the site all of July. We raised about a million dollars in seed funding by July 31st, launched the site in September and it just started to grow, and so . . .<br>
Aaron: That's, I mean, that's actually crazy. You both, you quit your jobs, middle of July, beginning of July, middle of July are working on it for 15 to 30 days and you raise a million bucks. That's a lot of money to give to two people who have just started really working on something. So, why do you think that happened? Why do you think you got the money?<br>
Liz: I think, at least for me, the main thing that investors kept saying was the fact that they all saw this problem, not just from themselves when they were in college, and I'm talking like 60-year-olds to 25-year year-olds, who all saw this problem of how hard it is to find a part time job or internship or even full time job after school, but also all of their startups and their portfolios were so desperately trying to hire college students, whether it was for summer internships or campus rep jobs, etc., and so they all saw this need, from both the user and the employer perspective.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
J.J.: And I think even once we're getting past the first meeting where we get to tell that story, I think, I hope that we were able to show them that we meant business by, when Liz went in for the first meeting, she would listen to their feedback and if they had feedback on a product feature or something, by the next meeting, it would exist or it would have changed, or I would've just built it. And that was a really cool thing to come back to an investor with.<br>
Aaron: So, this is an interesting thing and actually kind of a challenge, where investors or people who aren't your core demographic of users will suggest features because they think it would be cool. How did you decide whether or not that feature was actually something that your users wanted, right? Your users are the important thing here, not really your investors. So, how did you decide what to build and what not to build?<br>
Liz: I think at the very beginning, it was honestly us checking our gut. I don't think, we were based near a lot of NYU students at the very start and so, we would go and talk to NYU students as much as possible, but, very often, people don't know what they want until they get it and then they can complain or compliment. And so, at the very beginning, it was trusting our gut.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. I think that this is something, I love the parallels to PlanGrid's story, where Ryan and Tracy were their original users, right? You were, you needed blueprints.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, I mean, in our case, Y Combinators always stressing talking to users, but, in our case, there are four founders and two of them were the users.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
Ryan: And so, the way the product basically got built is, we were able to iterate five, six times a day on features where just Tracy and I were, would be like, this is exactly what it needs to do, and then Ralph and Antoine would find a way to make it happen. But, yeah, I mean, without talking to users or being a user yourself, I don't know how you can ever get the right features, because the stuff that investors would suggest to us were, like my wife's an architect. It should do this. Well, that doesn't actually make any sense. But, if you're not confident, you can be misled real easily.<br>
Aaron: If you're just joining us, I'm Aaron Harris and you're listening to Startup School Radio. My guests right now are Ryan Sutton-Gee from PlanGrid and Liz Wessel and J.J. Fliegelman from Campus Job. We were just talking about the importance of talking to your users and how valuable it is for you to be your own users. And Ryan, I think you just put it perfectly, which is, when you are your own user, your cycle of iteration, especially early on, is dramatically faster, and this is why we talk about solving your own problem. I mean, you could solve a problem for an astronaut, smart people, I'm sure you could figure out things. But if you're not an astronaut, you're going to have to go and check with the astronaut every single time you need to make a change, whereas if it's your own, Liz, you kept talking about trusting your gut and looking at your gut. And you were your original users. You were Campus Reps. You weren't so far out of college that you had forgotten what it was like. So, you were able to test and say, ""Huh, will this make my life better? Would this have made my life better?"" And if the answer is yes, you can move forward and then see sort of what your users actually do with it.<br>
Liz: And we even, everything down to like the language on the website, when you try to log out as a student, we show you a video of a guy being slapped across the face in slow motion and we say, are you sure you want to log out? This is how you're making us feel. Like, we really try to have that sense of humor and speak to our users the way we would want to be spoken to.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. I remember Groupon used to do that.<br>
Liz: Yeah.<br>
Aaron: Groupon spent a lot of time making people laugh if they tried to do things.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: Especially when it was something they didn't want them to do. It was like, hey, if I leave you with a positive impression, maybe you'll still leave but you're going to remember me and tell other people about it and probably come back at some point.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: Okay. So, you raise a million bucks and I'm guessing you just go out to fancy dinners, blow it all on nice clothes or whatever. So, what do you actually do once you have money? How does it change the way you operate and change the way you start building the business?<br>
J.J.: One of the very first things we did was we started using Campus Job to hire campus reps to help build out our marketplace, to help out with the student side.<br>
Aaron: So, the Campus Rep might have been dead but not really.<br>
Liz: Exactly. So, we hired our first employee right away. Nikki, who would run a Campus Rep program, that she sourced all the Campus Reps from Campus Job. We were very fortunate in that our lead investors gave us their office space for free. So, we didn't have to spend money on that, so we actually had an incredibly low burn rate at the very start, especially because we were paying our Campus Reps on a performance basis. So, we weren't just throwing out money. It was, if they delivered, then we would pay.<br>
Aaron: That is, I can't stress enough how important it is to do what Liz just said, which is keep your burn rate low. We just had our last dinner for YC's winter 2015 batch last night and I think the most frequent piece of advice we gave was keep your burn low. Even if you raise a million dollars, it seems like a lot of money, and people say, I could never spend that much but my partner Paul [inaudible 00:43:41] likes to say, it's not your money and I think a lot of people miss that and they go and spend it on, frankly, stupid stuff. When that money should be treated as last money you'll ever raise and that's what you'll need to get to profitability. And you did that, right? You were super smart with it, which is, I think, sort of indicative of you being good as founders and doing your jobs right.<br>
<br>
So you get performance based fees for people hiring and you're working on the site, you got free office space. Then what?<br>
Liz: Then we just focus on building and growing everything. The employer side, we tried everything, every sales idea we could come up with before we were able to hire our first actual salesperson, which didn't happen until January.<br>
Aaron: And the salespeople for hiring clients, students . . .<br>
Liz: For getting employers to post jobs, yeah. We don't consider students customers, because they don't pay us. They just use the site for free to find jobs.<br>
Aaron: How do you make money?<br>
Liz: Employers pay per applicant that they receive.<br>
Aaron: That's cool.<br>
Liz: So, if a student clicks apply through our site, they don't get brought to a new site where they have to fill out a form. Their application gets submitted right there to the business, and then every time they click apply, we make money and the employer is the one who pays that money.<br>
Aaron: So, you're kind of lifting a page from Google's playbook, which is people pay us when people click on useful things, basically.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: And so, you start bringing in employers and you start getting students. How quickly do you start growing?<br>
Liz: Quick.<br>
J.J.: Pretty fast. Pretty fast.<br>
Liz: So, we had a couple of thousand students at the very, day one, just because of the fact that we transferred them over from, oh, we didn't transfer. We emailed all the students from the old website and then, at the very start, our Campus Reps were really good and they just hit the ground running and I think, at the end of the day, they can plant the seeds on their campus but what creates a network effect is when you see your friend got a really cool job and you ask them how they got that job and they say CampusJob.com and, all of a sudden, they sign up for CampusJob.com. And so, we used our Campus Reps to plant the seeds and then we knew we would only grow via network effect, which is the way we believe we should grow, if we were delivering jobs.<br>
So, at the end of the day it was all about get as many employers and as many students as possible and, right now, with our marketplace, we're definitely not signing up as many employers as we are students. So, we've really been focusing on growing out the employer side.<br>
Aaron: Right. Although you wouldn't expect to have quite as many employers as students.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: But you want growth rates that look good on both sides, so that the marketplace is healthy. We've been thinking about different marketplaces and thinking about how these things grow, you have this challenge of chickens and eggs, right? You need one to get the other. And it sounds like you started out, you kind of cheated, right? Because you started out with both, because of the Campus Rep. You knew both sides a little bit, which is kind of the way to do it. You can't, I mean. . .<br>
Liz: We cheated a little bit but I will say our revenue model made it so that it was a no risk, no brainer for businesses, because you don't pay us a dime unless you get applicants who, by the way, are qualified to apply. Because when a business posts a job, they say, I only want computer science students with a 4.0, who attend MIT and who speak Spanish to apply to my job. And we will only show your job to students who match these qualifications. And it's free until someone applies and then you pay a few bucks. And so, at the end of the day, it really was a no risk solution for businesses.<br>
Aaron: That's interesting. Ralph from PlanGrid just told us that the first question that Paul Graham asked was basically how you are going to convince IT departments to actually use the thing, because it's the business, B to B problem, enterprise sales are hard. And you guys, I think Ryan got around it by basically saying, it's not the IT departments, right?<br>
Ryan: Right, yeah. Those aren't the ones that actually buy it.<br>
Aaron: Right. And I think, Liz, you guys got around this in a different, slightly different way, which was we don't have to sell you anything, it's actually free. Right? If it works for you, give us a little money. If not, it's no harm, no foul, which is a pretty easy sell if you're saying we're going to send you great candidates.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: So, you're in New York, you're building it, it's going great. You have money. Why on earth did you move out to California to do YC for three months?<br>
J.J: Well, we met this great guy named Aaron Harris.<br>
Aaron: Oh, thanks, thanks.<br>
J.J.: No, but really, you were hugely influential. When we, I remember when we first spoke at Joe's Coffee and I was just really excited that I was introduced to you to talk about marketplaces. You were just telling us about more, in more detail about Y Combinator and what it could do for a company like ours and how it could really help us grow. Since, like Liz was just saying, we raised the money, we were focusing very strongly on talking to users, shaping futures and growing. [inaudible 00:48:28]<br>
Aaron: You were actually doing all the things we tell companies to do, which is why I was excited. I was like, Oh wow, they're already doing this stuff. We should just get them in because they don't have to do very much to help them.<br>
Liz: Which you did, by the way. But, yeah, you, J.J. came back from a meeting with you and said, ""I think we should apply to Y Combinator."" And I was very hesitant because I saw that our growth was continuing, and that things were going well and I said, ""Why change it? Why not, as you guys actually say, whatever's working to grow your company, keep doing that.""<br>
Aaron: Right.<br>
Liz: So, I said, ""Why would we move to California? We have a small team, etc."" But we started speaking to a lot of other Y Combinator companies, some who had traction as well before YC. And everyone just spoke the world of it and promised that they wouldn't regret it. One person even said, ""I'll buy you your entire seed round that you won't regret it,"" and so I took her up on that and there's no regrets. We are beyond thrilled.<br>
Aaron: So, you don't have to give her all the seed round money?<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: So, you guys came to YC in the end of 20, I mean, you applied sort of the end of 2014. Y Combinator was a known quantity. You knew what you were getting into. Ryan, when you applied, I mean, five years ago?<br>
Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, God, it's been that long hasn't it? Just four years ago.<br>
Aaron: Did you have any, I mean, you didn't even know what YC was until you accidently drove there.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, I mean, after being there and then you hear the stories of Reddit, and AirBNB and Dropbox, which were successes then, though nothing like they are now, and really what convinced me the most is just, like, within, like, literally within 30 minutes of Paul Graham talking about startups as an idea, like, as an economic, why they're economically powerful, and how, if you're a young, ambitious person, it's literally the most leveraged thing you can do. And he just upended my entire view of, like, what it means to, not even have a career, but what it means to work on things, period, and to build stuff. And so, once I had that, then it's, like, okay, how do I get to be one of these ambitious people that has really leveraged what they're working on?<br>
Aaron: I want to try an experiment, because you both went through YC in sort of different time periods, obviously, but, Ryan, if you had to boil YC down to two, I say, maximum two things, what would you say, what did we tell you to do at YC? What's the thing?<br>
Ryan: Yeah. I mean, obviously it's make something people want.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
Ryan: In our case, it was what we wanted and what, which by proxy, what the construction industry wanted, and the other thing is that it's just, there's so much institutional knowledge, in getting incorporated, finding employees, raising money, getting exposed, how not to be a founder team and fight over equity. There's just so many of the shortcuts that three months of Y Combinator easily saved us three years.<br>
Aaron: That's awesome.<br>
Ryan: If we had to iterate through it, it probably would have killed us as a company or somebody would have beat us to the punch.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
Ryan: So, it's just an amazing, like, super amazing shortcut on so many levels.<br>
Aaron: And Liz and J.J., what would you guys say, like, the two most important things that you learned at YC?<br>
J.J.: I think I learned focus on what matters.<br>
Aaron: Mm-hmm.<br>
J.J.: And the focus part is sometimes actually easier than figuring out what it is that matters to your business, but you have to be thoughtful about it and once you know, you can't let anything else destruct you.<br>
Aaron: And Liz, I'm gonna let you have the last word. What would you say you learned?<br>
Liz: I was going to say number one focus, and number two, grow and just focus on whatever makes you grow.<br>
Aaron: You know, it's funny. I'll edit that slightly. When we talk about focus and growth, people sometimes get it slightly wrong. They say growth is all we care about, but it's the focus that leads to the growth. Without that focus, you don't actually have the growth.<br>

It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear<br>
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important<br>
That without them, you feel like nothing<br>
No one will ever understand how much it hurts<br>
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you<br>
And when it's over and it's gone<br>
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back<br>
So that you could have the good<br>

"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
You got a fast car<br>
And I want a ticket to anywhere<br>
Maybe we make a deal<br>
Maybe together we can get somewhere<br>
Any place is better<br>
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose<br>
Maybe we'll make something<br>
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
You got a fast car<br>
And I got a plan to get us out of here<br>
I've been workin' at the convenience store<br>
Managed to save just a little bit of money<br>
Won't have to drive too far<br>
Just across thе border and into the city<br>
And you and I can both get jobs<br>
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'<br>

I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone<br>

[Verse 4]<br>
You got a fast car<br>
We go cruising, entertain ourselves<br>
You still ain't got a job<br>
So I work in the market as a checkout girl<br>
I know things will get better<br>
You'll find work and I'll get promoted<br>
And we'll move out of the shelter<br>
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs<br>

[Verse 5]<br>
You got a fast car<br>
I got a job that pays all our bills<br>
You stay out drinking late at the bar<br>
See more of your friends than you do your kids<br>
I'd always hoped for better<br>
Thought maybe together you and me would find it<br>
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere<br>
Take your fast car and keep on driving<br>

<br>
[Verso 1: Payo Solís &amp; <i>Junior H</i>]<br>
Juré y te había dicho que ya no te iba a llamar<br>
Pero es que en todo el día no te dejo de pensar<br>
<i>No acepto que acabó, que esto se terminó<br>
Y ahorita que me puse pedo ponme en altavoz</i><br>
<br>
[Coro: Payo Solís &amp; <i>Junior H</i>]<br>
Pa' que me escuches fuerte y claro<br>
Que yo aún no te he olvidado<br>
A estar sin ti no me acostumbro<br>
Me hace falta un beso tuyo<br>
<i>Por favor, mi amor, no cuelgues<br>
Mejor dime cuándo vuelves</i><br>
Pa' que vuelvan esos días<br>
Donde tú sí me querías<br>
Sé que no son horas para estar llamando<br>
Pero para andar dolido no hay horario<br>

Y el compa Junior<br>
Yayai<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Junior H &amp; <i>Payo Solís</i>]<br>
Yo sé que me quieres y que te hago falta<br>
Como tú me has hecho falta<br>
Pa' qué estás enojada<br>
Dime tú qué ganas ocultándome tus ganas<br>
<i>Yo sé que me quieres y que te hago falta<br>
Como tú me has hecho falta<br>
Pa' qué estás enojada<br>
Dime tú qué ganas ocultándome tus ganas</i><br>
Por ti sigo tomando<br>
<i>Me puse pedo y es por eso que te estoy llamando</i><br>
<br>
[Coro: Junior H &amp; <i>Payo Solís</i>]<br>
Pa' que me escuches fuerte y claro<br>
Que yo aún no te he olvidado<br>
A estar sin ti no me acostumbro<br>
Me hace falta un beso tuyo<br>
<i>Por favor, mi amor, no cuelgues<br>
Mejor dime cuándo vuelves<br>
Pa' que vuelvan esos días<br>
Donde tú sí me querías</i><br>
Sé que no son horas para estar llamando<br>
Pero para andar dolido no hay horario<br>
<br>
[Outro: Payo Solís]<br>
Sé que no son horas para estar llamando<br>
Pero para andar dolido no hay horario</p>

You know I'm just a flight away<br>
If you want it, you could take a private plane<br>
A kilómetros estamos conectando<br>
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando<br>
You know I got a lot to say<br>
All these voices in the background of my brain<br>
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando<br>
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando<br>

[Verso 1]<br>
Ayer te vi, aparentemente estabas contento, estabas feliz<br>
Besándola a ella, así como antes me besaba' a mí<br>

Ojalá me piense' de vez en cuando<br>

[Coro]<br>
Y aunque yo hago como si na'<br>
Baby, qué amargura me da saber que ahora<br>
Tú estás vacilando con otra<br>
Por fuera me río, pеro por adentro estoy rota<br>
Y aunque yo hago como si na' (Papi)<br>
Baby, qué amargura mе da saber que ahora<br>
Tú estás vacilando con otra<br>
Por fuera me río, pero por adentro estoy rota<br>
<br>
[Verso 2]<br>
Primero, quiero decirte que no hay un segundo que<br>
Piense que te lo dañó un tercero<br>
Sin ti se siente vacío el cuarto, insisto<br>
Polvo, llegábamos hasta el quinto<br>
Te extraño tanto, sin ti es distinto<br>
Me duele ver cómo me deja' en visto<br>
A veces pienso que me extraña' un poquito<br>
Yo misma lo' pajarito' me pinto (Ey)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Coro]<br>
Qué mal que ya no estés aquí<br>
Estaría tomándomelos contigo y no por ti, por ti<br>
En coleccionista me volví<br>
Guardando toa' las foto', me volví más devota y ni así<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Y aunque yo hago como si na'<br>

I like crazy, foolish, stupid<br>
Party going wild, fist pumping<br>
Music, I might lose it<br>
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)<br>
I don't care the night, she don't care we like<br>
Almost dared the right five<br>
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise<br>
Take me so high, jump and don't stop<br>
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man<br>
When they heading my van, mic check one two<br>
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose<br>
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow<br>
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto<br>
Club shuts down, a hundred super models<br>
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh<br>

Number one, club popper<br>
Got a hangover like too much vodka<br>
Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool<br>
No doubt by the end of the night<br>
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move<br>
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof<br>
All black shades when the sun come through<br>
Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show<br>
What happens to that body, it's a private show<br>
Stays right here, private show<br>
I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain<br>
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne<br>
My life, coming harder when we hit fame<br>
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane<br>
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh<br>
If I took you home, it'd be a home run<br>
Show me how you do<br>
I want to shut down the club, with you<br>
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh<br>
I am a wild one, break me in<br>
Saddle me up and lets begin<br>
I am a wild one, tame me now<br>
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl<br>
Show you another side of me<br>
A side you would never thought you would see<br>
Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough<br>
I hear you like the wild stuff<br>
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh<br>
If I took you home, it'd be a home run<br>
Show me how you'll do<br>
I want to shut down the club, with you<br>
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones) ooh<br>
I am a wild one break me in<br>
Saddle me up and let's begin<br>

Traigo puro exmilitar<br>
Y comando un gentillal por mi zona (Por mi zona)<br>

Ese bobo se perdió a esa mamacita tan chula<br>
Yo la vi en el club, la imagino desnuda<br>
Tiene dos amiga' que parecen de película<br>
Que dondequiera que llegan hacen la' demá' lucir ridícula'<br>

Él le falló y ella se rebeló<br>
Con sus amiga' de rumba salió, se le dio<br>

Подивись, що ти накоїв<br>
Бо тепер у нас ворожнеча, гей!<br>
<br>
[Куплет 1: Кендрік Ламар]<br>
Я не можу нічого повернути, поглянь на мене зараз<br>
Ми були неповторними як The D.O.C, пам'ятаєш? (Пам'ятаєш?)<br>
Я був надмірно відданий нашому коханню, подивись на факти<br>
А тепер поглянь на нас, ми схожі на Ірак<br>
Я не ненавиджу тебе, але не хочу критикувати і переоцінювати<br>
Ці ритми почорнілого серця, я замінив тебе на баси<br>
Мине час і зітре тебе, і цього кохання я більше не чутиму<br>
Ні, я більше не боюся<br>
До того ж, повага вже не така щира<br>
<br>
[Передписпів]<br>
Так сумно думати про хороші часи<br>
Про нас з тобою<br>

Любий, тепер у нас ворожнеча<br>
У нас було шалене кохання<br>
Подивись, що ти накоїв<br>
Бо тепер у нас ворожнеча, гей!<br>
Тепер у нас проблеми<br>
Я не думаю, що їх можна вирішити<br>
Ти наніс дуже глибоку рану<br>
І любий, тепер у нас ворожнеча, гей!<br>
<br>
[Куплет 2: Кендрік Ламар]<br>
Пам'ятаєш, як ти намагалася списати мене з рахунку?<br>
Пам'ятаєш, як ти думала, що я зазнаю поразки?<br>
Хіба не пам'ятаєш? Ти думала, що будеш мені потрібна<br>
Дотримуйся процедури, пам'ятаєш? О, заждіть, у тебе амнезія<br>
Це був сезон бойових поранень<br>
Бойові шрами, побої, синці<br>
Удар ножем у спину, сірка, шалене полум'я<br>
І все ж, життя у мене при грошах і владі<br>
І от ти житимєш тільки ворожнечею<br>
<br>

[Брідж]<br>
Пластирі не лікують кульові рани<br>
Твої вибачення -  просто показуха<br>
Якщо ти живеш так, ти живеш з привидами<br>
Ти прощаєш, забуваєш, але ніколи не відпускаєш<br>
Пластирі не лікують кульові рани<br>
Твої вибачення -  просто показуха<br>
Якщо ти живеш так, ти живеш з привидами<br>

Era para eu? Ok... amor<br>
Amor, amor, amor, amor amor (sexo)<br>
Amor, amor, amor, amor, amor, amor, amor (sexo)<br>
<br>
[Verso 1: Mac Miller]<br>
Esse sol não brilha quando eu estou sozinho<br>
Eu perco minha mente e eu perco o controle<br>
Eu vejo seus olhos olharеm através da minha alma<br>
Não se surpreenda, isso é tudo que eu sеi<br>
Eu senti as alturas e elas parecem com você<br>
Veja um amor como o meu é muito bom para ser verdade<br>
E você é divina demais para para ser minha<br>
Você me lembra da cor azul<br>
Garota, eu estou tão apaixonado por você, yeah<br>
Garota, eu estou tão apaixonado por você<br>
<br>
[Ponte: Mac Miller]<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah (Amor), yeah, yeah<br>
Um, bom<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Mac Miller]<br>
Amor, você foi tudo que eu sempre quis<br>
Eu comprei um anel de casamento, está no meu bolso<br>
Planejei para perguntar no outro dia<br>
Sabia que você iria correr para longe, então eu acho que eu só esqueci isso<br>
Lembra quando você foi para a faculdade?<br>
Horas no telefone, nós acabamos falando<br>
Passado, presente, futuro, todas as fofocas, caramba<br>
Amor de criança não é o que era, querida<br>
Sentimentos que nós temos são tão alarmantes<br>
Eu posso fazer você rir, eu posso quebrar o vidro<br>
Se a gente fizesse durar, isso seria o negócio<br>
Sr. Encantador, esse é o meu departamento<br>
Você estava lá antes dos carros caros e<br>
Você estava lá quando eu ainda era um artista faminto<br>
Quando o carro estava tendo problemas pra iniciar<br>
Agora nós temos nosso próprio apartamento, mesma caixa de correio<br>
Mesmo cesto para a roupa suja, a comida na geladeira é velha<br>
Essa manhã você cozinhou os ovos com a couve<br>
Eu tentei foder enquanto você estava se vestindo<br>
Você disse: ""Tudo que você pensa é sexo""<br>
Eu fiquei tipo: ""Oh bom, você me conhece tão bem<br>
E se foi isso que fez você se atrasar, eu juro, eu não vou contar<br>
E toda a vez que eu ligar para o seu celular, melhor você atender o seu celular<br>
Eu juro por Deus eu vou enlouquecer se eu for direto para a caixa postal""<br>
Bom, eu sou do tipo ciumento<br>
Mas eu juro que aquela bunda é o que o céu gosta<br>
E quando eu estou naquela buceta, é uma vida melhor<br>
Esse é o único jeito eu estou tentando terminar a noite<br>
É a minha única chance, melhor eu fazer isso certo<br>
<br>
[Ponte: Mac Miller]<br>
Leve o seu tempo, meu amor<br>
Está tudo esperando por você, por você<br>
Eu sei eu faço sua mente enlouquecer<br>
Mas está tudo esperando bem aqui por você, por você<br>
<br>
[Saída: Bilal]<br>
Você se aproxima, foge<br>
Tudo que eu sempre soube é a cor cinza<br>
Seus jeitos adoráveis me trazem brilhos do sol<br>
Eu achei um anjo tão divino<br>
Céu provavelmente não é o mesmo sem você<br>
Mas agora você está no meu mundo, meu mundo<br>
Ah-ah-ah<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
Ah-ah-ah<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah</p>

A hopeless romantic all my life<br>
Surrounded by couples all the time<br>
I guess I should take it as a sign<br>
(<i>Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?</i>)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Sio, <i>All</i>]<br>
I'm feelin' lonely (<i>Lonely</i>)<br>
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (<i>Hold me</i>)<br>
Now I'm crying in my room<br>
So skeptical of love (<i>Say what you say, but I want it more</i>)<br>
But still, I want it more, more, more<br>
<br>
[Chorus: All]<br>
I gave a second chance to Cupid<br>
But now I'm left here feelin' stupid<br>
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real<br>
Cupid is so dumb<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Aran]<br>
I look for his arrows every day<br>
I guess he got lost or flew away<br>
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)<br>

"<p>To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever<br>
<br>
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture<br>
<br>
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like <a href=""/3906523/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs/Ice-t-and-nwa-were-not-only-ruling-rap-but-beginning-to-enter-the-mainstream-music-conversation"" data-id=""3906523"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation</a><br>
<br>
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
Well, I've run through rainbows and castles of candy<br>
I've cried a river of tears from the pain<br>
I try to dance with what life has to hand me<br>
My partner's been pleasure, my partner's been pain<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
There are days when I swear I could fly like an eagle<br>
And dark desperate hours that nobody sees<br>
My arms stretched triumphant on top of the mountain<br>
My head in my hands, down on my knees<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze<br>
Sometimes love's blind and sometimes it sees<br>

[Verse 3]<br>
I've reached in darkness and come out with treasure<br>
I've laid down with love and I woke up with lies<br>

Sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze<br>

[Outro: Arthur Kar]<br>
Nah, I'm on, it's midnight, I don't care<br>
Nothing's happening on a Wednesday, I don't care, I'm on<br>
I'm looking for the smoke<br>
This guy sitting front row, man, poof, who needs that?<br>
Let me put my window down, I need fresh air<br>
We don't want that, we want bars<br>
The reason why we listen to 21 and The Boy<br>
That's what we do in Paris, we don't do Fashion Week<br>
Fashion Week, it's for the last decade, it's not for us<br>
It's about the lights, the lights that we put on in the city<br>
The lights of the Eiffel Tower<br>
I'm in charge of it, I'm the one who's putting it on every day<br>
And you try to flex next, next to me on the red light with your ugly, whatever, flexing, most expensive car, V12<br>
I drive a four-cylinder, I come from nothing, but I'm doing something and you cannot catch my drive<br>
As fast as you try to go, you will never catch me, man<br>
There is only one way, and this way I'm driving, nobody can do it<br>
I'm Birdman, that's who I am<br>
In Paris<br>
Brrt, brrt</p>

<br>
[Intro: Peso Pluma]<br>
¡Ay!<br>
<i>¡Bi-Bizarrap!</i><br>
¡Yee-hah-hah-ay!<br>
<br>
[Verso 1: Peso Pluma]<br>
Sigo aquí<br>
Ando varias noches sin dormir<br>
Estoy pedo, no te vo'a mentir<br>
Le hablé a otra morrita al deducir que te perdí<br>
Y ya no hay más<br>
Cosas que contigo quiero hablar<br>
Con otra piel yo te vo'a olvidar<br>
De mi mente yo te vo'a sacar<br>
<br>
[Coro: Peso Pluma]<br>
Y ya nos verán pistear<br>
Pura cadena gruesa y las plebitas son del Instagram<br>
Diamantón llevo en mi Glock<br>
Patek Phillippe es mi reloj (<i>Wuh</i>)<br>
Yo sé qué tanto me costó<br>
Y ahora navegamos por LA<br>
Y pa' Sinaloa me voy también<br>
Y las champañitas saben bien (<i>Bien, eh</i>)<br>
<br>
[Interludio: Peso Pluma]<br>
Así nomás, compa Biza<br>
Hasta Argentina, viejillo, ¡chau!<br>
Pura doble P<br>
Arriba los corridos<br>
¡Yih-yih-yih! ¡Ayayai!<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Peso Pluma]<br>
Sigo aquí<br>
Seguiré yo sin poder dormir<br>
Todo ha cambia'o cuando te fuiste de aquí<br>
Ya me prometí no repetir<br>
Y ya será<br>
Muy tarde pa' cuando quieras más<br>
Tú solita tienes que aceptar<br>
En mis brazos ya no vas a estar<br>
<br>

All I ever tried to do was help you understand and grow<br>

'Less you get somebody else who's on my level, but you know<br>
That there's no one on my level, you gon' realize if you don't<br>

How come when I love somebody, part of me don't wanna stay?<br>
Every time I get too close, I just start pushing them away<br>

Maybe I just wanna leave before they try to leave me first<br>
Maybe I don't wanna need 'em 'til they say they need me first<br>

Hard to play cool, heart belongs to<br>
You, I know that if I show that<br>
I keep my walls up, if you want me, then you better start to climb<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""Hey Mor"" ft. Feid]<br>
<br>
[Pre-Coro: Ozuna]<br>
Dime, ¿qué carajo fue lo que me hiciste?<br>
Son las 6 a. m. y quiero dormirme ya<br>
Pero no he podido desde que te fuiste<br>
¿Qué tú me hiciste?<br>
<br>
[Coro: Feid &amp; <i>Ozuna</i>]<br>
Hey, ma, ¿cómo te saco de aquí?<br>
Llego a la disco y solo pienso en ti<br>
Lo que hicimo' yo lo quiero olvidar<br>
<i>Con otra, pero no sab</i><i>e igual</i> (<i>No</i>)<br>
<i>¿Pa' qué te voy a mentir?</i> (<i>Te voy a mentir</i>)<br>
<i>Ando con culo', pero pienso en ti<br>
Lo que hicimo' no lo quiero olvidar, lo quiero repetir, baby</i><br>
<br>
[Verso 1: Feid]<br>
Estás perdida, ¿qué vas a hacer hoy?<br>
Te vi puesta pa'l gym o para еl vacilón<br>
Baby, tú eras real, las otras plástico<br>
Pusiste a еsta liendra a hablar romántico (Uy)<br>
Te pienso todo' los día'<br>
Uno no cambia un Mercede' por un Kia<br>
Sé que cagué la relación, mala mía<br>
Baby, no sé pa' qué peleamo', si podemo' estar haciendo groserías<br>
Condado, vista al mar amanecimos ese día<br>
Nos fuimo' 'e Fifty Eight pa' la playa<br>
Pero nunca pensé que iba a ser el último día<br>
Baby, ¿dónde estás? Que yo paso por ti<br>
Ando activo con los títeres en las motoras, a ver si te veo por ahí<br>
<br>
[Coro: Ozuna &amp; <i>Feid</i>]<br>
Hey, ma, ¿cómo te saco de aquí? (¿Cómo te saco de aquí?)<br>
Si llego a la disco y pienso en ti<br>
Lo que hicimo' lo he querido borrar<br>
<i>Con otra chimba, pero no sabe igual</i> (No)<br>
<i>¿Pa' qué te voy a mentir?</i> (<i>Te voy a mentir</i>)<br>
<i>Si no hay trago' solo pienso en ti<br>
Lo que hicimo' no lo quiero olvidar, lo quiero repetir</i> (<i>Suena</i>), baby<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Ozuna]<br>
Un culo como el tuyo, cualquiera peca (Cualquiera peca)<br>
Tú solo dime cuándo quiere' que te meta<br>
Que hoy ando con el combo, los rompediscoteca'<br>
Es que, bebé, tú ere' la neta, pero<br>
Solo quiero que te decida' pa' irte a buscar (Pa' irte a buscar)<br>
Un perreíto lento y adentro terminar<br>
Solo falta que te decidas pa' irte a buscar (Pa' irte a buscar)<br>
Un perreíto lento y adentro terminar<br>
Hmm, dame lu', que no sé<br>
Dame agua, que tengo sed<br>
Hoy quiero invertir lo que me gasté (Me gasté)<br>
Con toa' las sustancia' son más de las tre' (Eh-eh)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Coro: Feid]<br>
Dime, ¿qué putas fue lo que me hiciste? (Oh, no)<br>
Son las 6 a. m. y no puedo dormirme ya<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""Según Quién""]<br>
<br>
[Verso 1: Maluma &amp; <i>Carin León</i>]<br>
Ay, otro chisme más que te cae<br>
Estoy cansado de este lleva y trae, ey<br>
Aquí si hay amor, pero amor para ti ya no hay<br>
<i>No te creas tan importante<br>
Las cosas ya no son como antes</i> (Ah-ah-ah), <i>eh<br>
Hace mucho que yo ya te olvidé</i><br>
<br>
[Coro: Maluma &amp; <i>Carin León</i>]<br>
Y ahora dizque me vieron gritando tu nombre<br>
Borracho en un bar, no sé en dónde, bebé<br>
¿Según quién? ¿Según quién?<br>
<i>Ahora resulta que vivo en despecho<br>
Y te tengo guardado en el pecho, bebé<br>
¿Según quién? ¿Según quién?</i><br>
<br>
[Post-Coro: Maluma]<br>
Ey<br>
Dile al que te está informando (¿Ah?)<br>
Que te está mal informando, que te informe bien (Maluma, baby)<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Maluma &amp; <i>Carin León</i>]<br>
Ahora tengo un culo inédito que se lleva to' los mérito'<br>
'Tá conmigo porque quiere, tú estaba' por la de crédito<br>
Deja el papelón patético, que yo estoy tranquilo en México<br>
Pa' esa mierda que tú habla' te compré papel higiénico<br>
<i>¿Quién putas te dijo que aún te lloro?<br>
Ni que fueras monedita de oro<br>
Tan huevón, yo que te di mi todo<br>
Y tú me pusiste los del toro</i><br>
<br>

"<p>Letter from Mr. Abel James, with Notes of my Life<br>
(received in Paris).<br>
<br>
""MY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND:  I have often been <a href=""/8631494/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Desirous-of-writing-to-thee"" data-id=""8631494"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">desirous of writing to thee</a>, but could not be reconciled to the thought that the letter might fall into the hands of the British, lest some printer or busy-body should publish some part of the contents, and give our friend pain, and myself censure.<br>
<br>
""Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about<br>
twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an account of the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending in the year 1730, with which there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a copy of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued it up to a later period, that the first and latter part may be put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope thee will not delay it.  Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say if kind, humane, and benevolent Ben.  Franklin should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to millions?  The influence writings under that class have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain, as in our public friend's journals.  It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoring to become as good and <a href=""/8997672/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Eminen"" data-id=""8997672"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">eminen</a>t as the journalist.  Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it could not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would such a work be!  I know of no character living, nor many of them put together, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and temperance with the American youth.  Not that I think the work would have no other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is of such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.""<br>

The foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown to a friend, I received from him the following:<br>

I would say to him, <a href=""/4975609/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Sir-i-solicit-the-history-of-your-life-from-the-following-motives-your-history-is-so-remarkable-that-if-you-do-not-give-it-somebody-else-will-certainly-give-it-and-perhaps-so-as-nearly-to-do-as-much-harm"" data-id=""4975609"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Sir, I solicit the history of your life from the following motives:  Your history is so remarkable, that if you do not give it, somebody else will certainly give it; and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm</a>, as<br>
your own management of the thing might do good.  It will moreover present a table of the internal circumstances of your country, which will very much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds.  And considering the eagerness with which such information is sought by them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of a more efficacious advertisement than your biography would give.  <a href=""/4973411/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/All-that-has-happened-to-you-is-also-connected-with-the-detail-of-the-manners-and-situation-of-a-rising-people-and-in-this-respect-i-do-not-think-that-the-writings-of-caesar-and-tacitus-can-be-more-interesting-to-a-true-judge-of-human-nature-and-society"" data-id=""4973411"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">All that has happened to you is also connected with the detail of the manners and situation of a rising people; and in this respect I do not think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus can be more interesting to a true judge of human nature and society.</a>  But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion, compared with the chance which your life will give for the forming of future great men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which you design to publish) of improving the features<br>
of private character, and consequently of aiding all happiness, both<br>
public and domestic.  The two works I allude to, sir, will in<br>
particular give a noble rule and example of self-education. School and other education constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple, and the mark a true one; and while parents and young persons are left destitute of other just means of estimating and becoming prepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery that the thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable!  Influence upon the private character, late in life, is not only an influence late in life, but a weak influence.  <a href=""/4975861/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/It-is-in-youth-that-we-plant-our-chief-habits-and-prejudices-it-is-in-youth-that-we-take-our-party-as-to-profession-pursuits-and-matrimony-in-youth-therefore-the-turn-is-given-in-youth-the-education-even-of-the-next-generation-is-given-in-youth-the-private-and-public-character-is-determined-and-the-term-of-life-extending-but-from-youth-to-age-life-ought-to-begin-well-from-youth-and-more-especially-before-we-take-our-party-as-to-our-principal-objects"" data-id=""4975861"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">It is in youth that we plant our chief habits and prejudices; it is in youth that we take our party as to profession, pursuits and matrimony.  In youth, therefore, the turn is given; in youth the education even of the next generation is given; in youth the private and public character is determined; and the term of life extending but from youth to age, life ought to begin well from youth, and more especially before we take our party as to our principal objects.</a>  But your biography will not merely teach self-education, but the educa<a href=""/9155953/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Tion-of-a-wise-man-and-the-wisest-man-will-receive-lights-and-improve-his-progress-by-seeing-detailed-the-conduct-of-another-wise-man"" data-id=""9155953"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">tion of a wise man; and the wisest man will receive lights and improve his progress, by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man</a>.  And why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we see our race has been blundering on in the dark, almost without a guide in<br>
this particular, from the farthest trace of time?  <a href=""/4973558/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Show-then-sir-how-much-is-to-be-done-both-to-sons-and-fathers-and-invite-all-wise-men-to-become-like-yourself-and-other-men-to-become-wise"" data-id=""4973558"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Show then, sir, how<br>
much is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and invite all wise men to become like yourself, and other men to become wise.</a>  <a href=""/4978374/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/When-we-see-how-cruel-statesmen-and-warriors-can-be-to-the-human-race-and-how-absurd-distinguished-men-can-be-to-their-acquaintance-it-will-be-instructive-to-observe-the-instances-multiply-of-pacific-acquiescing-manners-and-to-find-how-compatible-it-is-to-be-great-and-domestic-enviable-and-yet-good-humored"" data-id=""4978374"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">When we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race, and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance, it will be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific, acquiescing manners; and to find how compatible it is to be great and domestic, enviable and yet<br>
good-humored.</a><br>
<br>
""The little private incidents which you will also have to relate, will<br>
have considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules of prudence in ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how you have acted in these.  It will be so far a sort of key to life, and explain many things that all men ought to have once explained to them, to give, them a chance of becoming wise by foresight.  The nearest thing to having experience of one's own, is to have other people's affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting; this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management will have an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originality as if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy; and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and its errors considered) than human life?<br>
<br>
""Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated<br>
fantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes; but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing but what is at the same moment, wise, practical and good, your account of yourself (for I suppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin, will hold not only in point of character, but of private history) will show that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important, as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue, or greatness.  As no end likewise happens without a means, so we shall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable; but at the same time we may see that though the event is flattering, the means are as simple as wisdom could make them; that is, depending upon<br>
nature, virtue, thought and habit. Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of everyman's waiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world.  Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life.  Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoyment instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets.  Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselves in countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whom patience is so often the characteristic.  Your Quaker correspondent, sir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling Dr. Franklin), <a href=""/4976740/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Praised-your-frugality-diligence-and-temperance-which-he-considered-as-a-pattern-for-all-youth"" data-id=""4976740"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">praised your frugality, diligence and temperance, which<br>
he considered as a pattern for all youth</a>; but it is singular that he<br>
should have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness, without which you never could have waited for your advancement, or found your situation in the mean time comfortable; which is a strong lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importance of regulating our minds. If this correspondent had known the nature of your reputation as well as I do, he would have said, Your former writings and measures would secure attention to your Biography, and <a href=""/9003037/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Art-of-virtue"" data-id=""9003037"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Art of Virtue</a>; and your Biography and Art of Virtue, in return, would secure attention to them. This is an advantage attendant upon a various character, and which brings all that belongs to it into greater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps more persons are at a loss for the means of improving their minds and characters, than they are for the time or the inclination to do it.  But there is one concluding reflection, sir, that will shew the use of your life as a mere piece of biography.  This style of writing seems a little gone out of vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimen of it may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject of comparison with the lives of various public<br>
cutthroats and intriguers, and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or vain literary triflers.  If it encourages more writings of the same kind with your own, and induces more men to spend lives fit to be written, it will be worth all Plutarch's Lives put together.  But being tired of figuring to myself a character of which every feature suits only one man in the world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall end my letter, my dear Dr. Franklin, with a personal application to your proper self.  I am earnestly <a href=""/9155963/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Desirous"" data-id=""9155963"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">desirous</a>, then, my dear sir, that you should let the world into the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils may otherwise tend to disguise or traduce it.  Considering your great age, the caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking, it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficiently master of the facts of your life, or the intentions of your mind.  Besides all this, the immense revolution of the present period, will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it, and when virtuous principles have been pretended in it, it will be highly important to shew that such have really influenced; and, as your own character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny, it is proper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising country, as well as upon England and upon Europe) that it should stand respectable and<br>
eternal.  <a href=""/4976687/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/For-the-furtherance-of-human-happiness-i-have-always-maintained-that-it-is-necessary-to-prove-that-man-is-not-even-at-present-a-vicious-and-detestable-animal-and-still-more-to-prove-that-good-management-may-greatly-amend-him-and-it-is-for-much-the-same-reason-that-i-am-anxious-to-see-the-opinion-established-that-there-are-fair-characters-existing-among-the-individuals-of-the-race-for-the-moment-that-all-men-without-exception-shall-be-conceived-abandoned-good-people-will-cease-efforts-deemed-to-b"" data-id=""4976687"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">For the furtherance of human happiness, I have always<br>

As I have not read any part of the life in question, but know only the character that lived it, I write somewhat at hazard.  I am sure, however, that the life and the treatise I allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chief of my expectations; and still more so if you take up the measure of suiting these performances to the several views above stated.  Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirer of yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed pieces to interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasure that is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain.

Continuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris,<br>
1784.<br>
<br>
It is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have been too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain. It might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers, which would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my return being uncertain, and having just now a little leisure, I will endeavour to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home, it may there be corrected and improv'd.<br>
<br>
Not having any copy here of what is already written, I know not whether an account is given of the means I used to establish the Philadelphia public library, which, from a small beginning, is now become so considerable, though I remember to have come down to near the time of that transaction (1730). I will therefore begin here with an account of it, which may be struck out if found to have been already given.<br>
<br>
At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston. In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books. Those who lov'd reading were obliged to send for their books from England; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had left the alehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in. I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room, where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wish'd to read at home. This was accordingly done, and for some time contented us.<br>
<br>
Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find more than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings each, and ten <a href=""/9155965/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Shillings"" data-id=""9155965"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">shillings</a> per annum. On this little fund we began. The books were imported; the library was opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned. The institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns, and in other provinces. <a href=""/4964220/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/The-libraries-were-augmented-by-donations-reading-became-fashionable-and-our-people-having-no-publick-amusements-to-divert-their-attention-from-study-became-better-acquainted-with-books-and-in-a-few-years-were-observd-by-strangers-to-be-better-instructed-and-more-intelligent-than-people-of-the-same-rank-generally-are-in-other-countries"" data-id=""4964220"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">The libraries were augmented by donations; reading became fashionable; and our people, having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study, became better acquainted with books, and in a few years were observ'd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other countries.</a><br>
<br>
When we were about to sign the above mentioned articles, which were to be binding on us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden, the scrivener, said to us, ""You are young men, but it is scarcely probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fix'd in the instrument."" A number of us, however, are yet living; but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.<br>
<br>
The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's self as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbours, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs, someone more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to their right owner.<br>
<br>
This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study, for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me. Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my business continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary. I was indebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to be educated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, who were established in the place before me. My circumstances, however, grew daily easier. My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverb of Solomon, ""Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean men,"" I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I should ever literally stand before kings, which, however, has since happened; for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of sitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.<br>

It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to industry and frugality as myself. She assisted me chearfully in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old linen rags for the paper-makers, etc., etc.</a> We kept no idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a long time break and milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon. But mark how luxury will enter families, and make a progress, in spite of principle: being call'd one morning to breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty <a href=""/9003138/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Shillings"" data-id=""9003138"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">shillings</a>, for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but that <a href=""/4971174/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/She-thought-her-husband-deservd-a-silver-spoon-and-china-bowl-as-well-as-any-of-his-neighbors-this-was-the-first-appearance-of-plate-and-china-in-our-house-which-afterward-in-a-course-of-years-as-our-wealth-increasd-augmented-gradually-to-several-hundred-pounds-in-value"" data-id=""4971174"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">she thought her husband deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his neighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and China in our house, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.</a><br>
<br>
I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and though some of the dogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decrees of God, election, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible, others doubtful, and <a href=""/4975210/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/I-early-absented-myself-from-the-public-assemblies-of-the-sect-sunday-being-my-studying-day-i-never-was-without-some-religious-principles-i-never-doubted-for-instance-the-existence-of-the-deity-that-he-made-the-world-and-governd-it-by-his-providence-that-the-most-acceptable-service-of-god-was-the-doing-good-to-man-that-our-souls-are-immortal-and-that-all-crime-will-be-punished-and-virtue-rewarded-either-here-or-hereafter-these-i-esteemd-the-essentials-of-every-religion-and-being-to-be-found-in-a"" data-id=""4975210"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">I early absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'd it by his Providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter. These I esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being to be found in all the religions we had in our country, I respected them all, tho' with different degrees of respect, as I found them more or less mix'd with other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd principally to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another.</a> This respect to all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects, induc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his own religion; and as our province increas'd in people, and new places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary contribution, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.<br>
<br>
<a href=""/4977845/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Tho-i-seldom-attended-any-public-worship-i-had-still-an-opinion-of-its-propriety-and-of-its-utility-when-rightly-conducted"" data-id=""4977845"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Tho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted,</a> and I regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia. He us'd to visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonished me to attend his administrations, and I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, once for five Sundays successively. Had he been in my opinion a good preacher, perhaps I might have continued,[65] notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sunday's leisure in my course of study; but his discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments, or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying, since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc'd, their aim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good citizens.<br>
<br>
At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of Philippians, ""Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any praise, think on these things."" And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a text, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confin'd himself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keeping holy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holy Scriptures. 3. Attending duly the publick worship. 4. Partaking of the Sacrament. 5. Paying a due respect to God's ministers. These might be all good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things that I expected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I had some years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion. I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to the public assemblies. My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it, without attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being to relate facts, and not to make apologies for them.<br>
<br>
IX<br>
<br>
PLAN FOR ATTAINING MORAL PERFECTION<br>
<br>
block-IT was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection. I wish'd to live without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined.[66] While my care was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and established, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the following method.<br>
<br>
In the various <a href=""/9003056/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Enumerations"" data-id=""9003056"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">enumerations</a> of the moral virtues I had met with in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance, for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure, appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice and ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I gave to its meaning.<br>
<br>
These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:<br>
<br>
1. Temperance<br>
<br>
Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.<br>
<br>
2. Silence.<br>
<br>
Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.<br>
<br>
3. Order.<br>
<br>
Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.<br>
<br>
4. Resolution.<br>
<br>
Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.<br>
<br>
5. Frugality.<br>
<br>
Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i. e., waste nothing.<br>
<br>
6. Industry.<br>
<br>
Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.<br>
<br>
7. <a href=""/9012665/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Sincerity"" data-id=""9012665"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Sincerity.</a><br>
<br>
Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.<br>
<br>
8. Justice.<br>
<br>
Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.<br>
<br>
9. Moderation.<br>
<br>
Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.<br>
<br>
10. Cleanliness.<br>
<br>
Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.<br>
<br>
11. Tranquillity.<br>
<br>
Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.<br>
<br>
12. Chastity.<br>
13. Humility.<br>
<br>
<a href=""/4977817/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Imitate-jesus-and-socrates"" data-id=""4977817"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</a><br>
<br>
My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang'd them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir'd and establish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, and considering that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silence the second place. This and the next, Order, I expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once become habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeing me from my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras[67] in his Golden Verses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination.<br>
<br>
I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues.[68] I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day. I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.<br>

I determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues successively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every the least offense against Temperance, leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much strengthen'd, and its opposite weaken'd, that I might venture extending my attention to include the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should be happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.<br>
<br>
This my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's Cato:<br>
<br>
""Here will I hold. If there's a power above us<br>
(And that there is, all nature cries aloud<br>
Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;<br>
And that which he delights in must be happy.""<br>
Another from Cicero,<br>
<br>
""O vitæ Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex præceptis tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus.""[69]<br>
<br>
Another from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:<br>
<br>
""Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace."" iii. 16, 17.<br>
<br>
And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it; to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my tables of examination, for daily use.<br>
<br>
""O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual favours to me.""<br>
<br>
I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's Poems, viz.:<br>
<br>
""Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!<br>
O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!<br>
Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,<br>
From every low pursuit; and fill my soul<br>
With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;<br>
Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!""<br>

I enter'd upon the execution of this plan for self-examination, and continu'd it with occasional intermissions for some time. I was surpris'd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish. To avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new course, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines were drawn with red ink, that made a durable stain, and on those lines I mark'd my faults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out with a wet sponge. After a while I went thro' one course only in a year, and afterward only one in several years, till at length I omitted them entirely, being employ'd in voyages and business abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little book with me.<br>
<br>
My scheme of Order gave me the most trouble;[70] and I found that, tho' it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master, who must mix with the world, and often receive people of business at their own hours. Order, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method. This article, therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect, like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was, without farther grinding. ""No,"" said the smith, ""turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled."" ""Yes,"" says the man, ""but I think I like a speckled ax best."" And I believe this may have been the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that ""a speckled ax was best""; for something, that pretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself, to keep his friends in countenance.<br>
<br>
The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel<br>
In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it. <a href=""/4975955/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/But-on-the-whole-tho-i-never-arrived-at-the-perfection-i-had-been-so-ambitious-of-obtaining-but-fell-far-short-of-it-yet-i-was-by-the-endeavour-a-better-and-a-happier-man-than-i-otherwise-should-have-been-if-i-had-not-attempted-it-as-those-who-aim-at-perfect-writing-by-imitating-the-engraved-copies-tho-they-never-reach-the-wishd-for-excellence-of-those-copies-their-hand-is-mended-by-the-endeavour-and-is-tolerable-while-it-continues-fair-and-legible"" data-id=""4975955"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wish'd-for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavour, and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible.</a><br>
<br>
It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written. What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence; but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to help his bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribes his long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a good constitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon him; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues,[71] even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of temper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his company still sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance. I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.<br>
<br>
It will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without religion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of any particular sect. I had purposely avoided them; for, being fully persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that it might be serviceable to people in all religions, and intending some time or other to publish it, I would not have anything in it that should prejudice anyone, of any sect, against it. I purposed writing a little comment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the advantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice; and I should have called my book The Art of Virtue,[72] because it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that does not instruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed.—James ii. 15, 16.<br>
<br>
But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of my life, and public business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project, that required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.<br>
<br>
In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine, that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, but forbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man alone considered; that it was, therefore, everyone's interest to be virtuous who wish'd to be happy even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance (there being always in the world a number of rich merchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs, and such being so rare), have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortune as those of probity and integrity.<br>
<br>
My list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quaker friend having kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that my pride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that I was not content with being in the right when discussing any point, but was overbearing, and rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me by mentioning several instances; I determined endeavouring to cure myself, if I could, of this vice or folly among the rest, and I added Humility to my list, giving an extensive meaning to the word.<br>
<br>
I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it. I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbid myself, agreeably to the old laws of our Junto, the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly, etc., and I adopted, instead of them, I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so or so; or it so appears to me at present. When another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.<br>
<br>
And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit (after my character of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had early so much weight with my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.<br>
<br>
In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in this history; for, even if I could conceive that I had compleatly overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.<br>

[""I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but cannot have the help expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war. I have, however, found the following.""][73]<br>
<br>
Having mentioned a great and extensive project which I had conceiv'd, it seems proper that some account should be here given of that project and its object. Its first rise in my mind appears in the following little paper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:<br>
<br>
Observations on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.<br>
<br>
""That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc., are carried on and effected by parties.<br>
<br>
""That the view of these parties is their present general interest, or what they take to be such.<br>
<br>
""That the different views of these different parties occasion all confusion.<br>
<br>
""That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has his particular private interest in view.<br>
<br>
""That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each member becomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others, breaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.<br>
<br>
""That few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their country, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actings bring real good to their country, yet men primarily considered that their own and their country's interest was united, and did not act from a principle of benevolence.<br>
<br>
""That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the good of mankind.<br>
<br>
""There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a United Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations into a regular body, to be govern'd by suitable good and wise rules, which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience to, than common people are to common laws.<br>
<br>
""I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is well qualified, cannot fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.<br>
<br>
B. F.""<br>
<br>
Revolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter, when my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure, I put down from time to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughts as occurr'd to me respecting it. Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to be the substance of an intended creed, containing, as I thought, the essentials of every known religion, and being free of everything that might shock the professors of any religion. It is express'd in these words, viz.:<br>
<br>
""That there is one God, who made all things.<br>
<br>
""That he governs the world by his providence.<br>
<br>
""That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
""But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.<br>
<br>
""That the soul is immortal.<br>
<br>
""And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice, either here or hereafter.""<br>
<br>
My ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun and spread at first among young and single men only; that each person to be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed, but should have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks' examination and practice of the virtues, as in the beforemention'd model; that the existence of such a society should be kept a secret, till it was become considerable, to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons, but that the members should each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous, well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the scheme should be gradually communicated; that the members should engage to afford their advice, assistance, and support to each other in promoting one another's interests, business, and advancement in life; that, for distinction, we should be call'd The Society of the Free and Easy: free, as being, by the general practice and habit of the virtues, free from the dominion of vice; and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality, free from debt, which exposes a man to confinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors.<br>
<br>
This is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that I communicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with some enthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I was under of sticking close to my business, occasioned my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious occupations, public and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, so that it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise; though I am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme, and might have been very useful, by forming a great number of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the seeming magnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thought that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business.<br>

""Strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most careless way over the table and floor.""<br>
<br>
[71] While there can be no question that Franklin's moral improvement and happiness were due to the practice of these virtues, yet most people will agree that we shall have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to a virtuous life. Franklin's own suggestion that the scheme smacks of ""foppery in morals"" seems justified. Woodrow Wilson well puts it: ""Men do not take fire from such thoughts, unless something deeper, which is missing here, shine through them. What may have seemed to the eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of good sense and sound conduct. What redeems it from pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of usefulness to be seen in Franklin himself, who set these standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own life.""

POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC AND OTHER ACTIVITIES<br>
<br>
block-IN 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of Richard Saunders; it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly call'd Poor Richard's Almanac.[74] I endeavour'd to make it both entertaining and useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap'd considerable profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand. And observing that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhood in the province being without it, I consider'd it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people, who bought scarcely any other books; I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr'd between the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences, chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the means of procuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being more difficult for a man in want, to act always honestly, as, to use here one of those proverbs, it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright.<br>
<br>
These proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, I assembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to the Almanack of 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an auction. The bringing all these scatter'd councils thus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression. The piece, being universally approved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent; reprinted in Britain on a broadside, to be stuck up in houses; two translations were made of it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry, to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants. In Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities, some thought it had its share of influence in producing that growing plenty of money which was observable for several years after its publication.<br>

I considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicating instruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from the Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'd little pieces of my own, which had been first composed for reading in our Junto. Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that, whatever might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could not properly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial, showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude, and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations. These may be found in the papers about the beginning of 1735.[75]<br>
<br>
In the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libeling and personal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful to our country. Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind, and the writers pleaded, as they generally did, the liberty of the press, and that a newspaper was like a stage-coach, in which anyone who would pay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would print the piece separately if desired, and the author might have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself, but that I would not take upon me to spread his detraction; and that, having contracted with my subscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining, I could not fill their papers with private altercation, in which they had no concern, without doing them manifest injustice. Now, many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by false accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves, augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboring states, and even on the conduct of our best national allies, which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences. These things I mention as a caution to young printers, and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession by such infamous practices, but refuse steadily, as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct will not, on the whole, be injurious to their interests.<br>
<br>
In 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina, where a printer was wanting. I furnish'd him with a press and letters, on an agreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-third of the profits of the business, paying one-third of the expense. He was a man of learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account; and, tho' he sometimes made me remittances, I could get no account from him, nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived. On his decease, the business was continued by his widow, who, being born and bred in Holland, where, as I have been inform'd, the knowledge of accounts makes a part of female education, she not only sent me as clear a state as she could find of the transactions past, but continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness every quarter afterwards, and managed the business with such success, that she not only brought up reputably a family of children, but, at the expiration of the term, was able to purchase of me the printing-house, and establish her son in it.<br>
<br>
I mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch of education for our young females, as likely to be of more use to them and their children, in case of widowhood, than either music or dancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men, and enabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house, with establish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to undertake and go on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family.<br>
<br>
About the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young Presbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with a good voice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasions, who join'd in admiring them. Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers, his sermons pleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind, but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue, or what in the religious stile are called good works. Those, however, of our congregation, who considered themselves as orthodox Presbyterians, disapprov'd his doctrine, and were join'd by most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him of heterodoxy before the synod, in order to have him silenc'd. I became his zealous partisan, and contributed all I could to raise a party in his favour, and we combated for him awhile with some hopes of success. There was much scribbling pro and con upon the occasion; and finding that, tho' an elegant preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the Gazette of April, 1735. Those pamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial writings, tho' eagerly read at the time, were soon out of vogue, and I question whether a single copy of them now exists.[76]<br>
<br>
During the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly. One of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much admired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at least a part of it. On search, he found that part quoted at length, in one of the British Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster's.[77] This detection gave many of our party disgust, who accordingly abandoned his cause, and occasion'd our more speedy discomfiture in the synod. I stuck by him, however, as I rather approv'd his giving us good sermons composed by others, than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was the practice of our common teachers. He afterward acknowledg'd to me that none of those he preach'd were his own; adding, that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only. On our defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune, and I quitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I continu'd many years my subscription for the support of its ministers.<br>
<br>
I had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so much a master of the French as to be able to read the books with ease. I then undertook the Italian. An acquaintance, who was also learning it, us'd often to tempt me to play chess with him. Finding this took up too much of the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus'd to play any more, unless on this condition, that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task, either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart, or in translations, etc., which tasks the vanquish'd was to perform upon honour, before our next meeting. As we play'd pretty equally, we thus beat one another into that language. I afterwards with a little painstaking, acquir'd as much of the Spanish as to read their books also.<br>
<br>
I have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction in a Latin school, and that when very young, after which I neglected that language entirely. But, when I had attained an acquaintance with the French, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpris'd to find, on looking over a Latin Testament, that I understood so much more of that language than I had imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way.<br>
<br>
From these circumstances, I have thought that there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are told that it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that, it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more easily to acquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps, you will more easily gain them in descending; but certainly, if you begin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth, whether, since many of those who begin with the Latin quit the same after spending some years without having made any great proficiency, and what they have learnt becomes almost useless, so that their time has been lost, it would not have been better to have begun with the French, proceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after spending the same time, they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the Latin, they would, however, have acquired another tongue or two, that, being in modern use, might be serviceable to them in common life.[78]<br>
<br>
After ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy in my circumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations, which I could not sooner well afford. In returning, I call'd at Newport to see my brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Our former differences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate. He was fast declining in his health, and requested of me that, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant, I would take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring him up to the printing business. This I accordingly perform'd, sending him a few years to school before I took him into the office. His mother carried on the business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with an assortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner worn out. Thus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service I had depriv'd him of by leaving him so early.<br>
<br>
Our former differences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate<br>
In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.<br>
<br>
Our club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such satisfaction to the members, that several were desirous of introducing their friends, which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a convenient number, viz., twelve. We had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse. I was one of those who were against any addition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writing a proposal, that every member separately should endeavour to form a subordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the connection with the Junto. The advantages proposed were, the improvement of so many more young citizens by the use of our institutions; our better acquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion, as the Junto member might propose what queries we should desire, and was to report to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club; the promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation, and the increase of our influence in public affairs, and our power of doing good by spreading thro' the several clubs the sentiments of the Junto.<br>
<br>
The project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club, but they did not all succeed. Five or six only were compleated, which were called by different names, as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc. They were useful to themselves, and afforded us a good deal of amusement, information, and instruction, besides answering, in some considerable degree, our views of influencing the public opinion on particular occasions, of which I shall give some instances in course of time as they happened.<br>
<br>
My first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the General Assembly. The choice was made that year without opposition; but the year following, when I was again propos'd (the choice, like that of the members, being annual), a new member made a long speech against me, in order to favour some other candidate. I was, however, chosen, which was the more agreeable to me, as, besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk, the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members, which secur'd to me the business of printing the votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobbs for the public, that, on the whole, were very profitable.<br>
<br>
I therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who was a gentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likely to give him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed, afterwards happened. I did not, however, aim at gaining his favour by paying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this other method. Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says, ""He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged."" And it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings.<br>
<br>
In 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and then postmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, and inexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offered it to me. I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for, tho' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that improv'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as well as the advertisements to be inserted, so that it came to afford me a considerable income. My old competitor's newspaper declin'd proportionately, and I was satisfy'd without retaliating his refusal, while postmaster, to permit my papers being carried by the riders. Thus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect in due accounting; and I mention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ'd in managing affairs for others, that they should always render accounts, and make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality. The character of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all recommendations to new employments and increase of business.<br>

INTEREST IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS<br>
<br>
block-IBEGAN now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning, however, with small matters. The city watch was one of the first things that I conceiv'd to want regulation. It was managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn; the constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him for the night. Those who chose never to attend, paid him six shillings a year to be excus'd, which was suppos'd to be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality, much more than was necessary for that purpose, and made the constableship a place of profit; and the constable, for a little drink, often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch, that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with. Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and most of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to be read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting more particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the constables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a poor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds' worth of goods in his stores.<br>
<br>
On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge, the levying a tax that should be proportion'd to the property. This idea, being approv'd by the Junto, was communicated to the other clubs, but as arising in each of them; and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution, yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change, it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after, when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence.<br>
<br>
About this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was afterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means proposed of avoiding them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece, and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual assistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger. Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good order, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets, with strong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), which were to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together, in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires, as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions.<br>
<br>
The utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they were advised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on, one new company being formed after another, till they became so numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property; and now, at the time of my writing this, tho' upward of fifty years since its establishment, that which I first formed, called the Union Fire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho' the first members are all deceas'd but myself and one, who is older by a year than I am. The small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have been apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and other useful implements for each company, so that I question whether there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations; and, in fact, since these institutions, the city has never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time, and the flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed.<br>
<br>
the flames have often been extinguished<br>
In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield,[79] who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits, and he was oblig'd to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it was matter of speculation to me, who was one of the number, to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how much they admir'd and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by assuring them they were naturally half beasts and half devils. It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it seem'd as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street.<br>
<br>
And it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject to its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no sooner propos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions, but sufficient sums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erect the building, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the size of Westminster Hall;[80] and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected. Both house and ground were vested in trustees, expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something to the people at Philadelphia; the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general; so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.<br>
<br>
Mr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro' the colonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province had lately been begun, but, instead of being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen, accustomed to labour, the only people fit for such an enterprise, it was with families of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors, many of indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, being set down in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for. The sight of their miserable situation inspir'd the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of building an Orphan House there, in which they might be supported and educated. Returning northward, he preach'd up this charity, and made large collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.<br>
<br>
I did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from Philadelphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been better to have built the house here, and brought the children to it. This I advis'd; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected my counsel, and I therefore refus'd to contribute. I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to soften, and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of his oratory made me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver; and he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly into the collector's dish, gold and all. At this sermon there was also one of our club, who, being of my sentiments respecting the building in Georgia, and suspecting a collection might be intended, had, by precaution, emptied his pockets before he came from home. Towards the conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a strong desire to give, and apply'd to a neighbour who stood near him, to borrow some money for the purpose. The application was unfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His answer was, ""At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely; but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses.""<br>
<br>
Some of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument; but I, who was intimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermons and Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity, but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man; and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection. He us'd, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a mere civil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death.<br>
<br>
The following instance will show something of the terms on which we stood. Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston, he wrote to me that he should come soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he could lodge when there, as he understood his old friend and host, Mr. Benezet was removed to Germantown. My answer was, ""You know my house; if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be most heartily welcome."" He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer for Christ's sake, I should not miss of a reward. And I returned, ""Don't let me be mistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake."" One of our common acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing it to be the custom of the saints, when they received any favour, to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders, and place it in heaven, I had contriv'd to fix it on earth.<br>

<br>
He had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and sentences so perfectly, that he might be heard and understood at a great distance, especially as his auditories, however numerous, observ'd the most exact silence. He preach'd one evening from the top of the Courthouse steps, which are in the middle of Market-street, and on the west side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles. Both streets were fill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance. Being among the hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard, by retiring backwards down the street towards the river; and I found his voice distinct till I came near Front-street, when some noise in that street obscur'd it. Imagining then a semicircle, of which my distance should be the radius, and that it were fill'd with auditors, to each of whom I allow'd two square feet, I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand. This reconcil'd me to the newspaper accounts of his having preach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the fields, and to the ancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies, of which I had sometimes doubted.<br>
<br>
By hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermons newly compos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the course of his travels. His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequent repetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation of voice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that, without being interested in the subject, one could not help being pleas'd with the discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv'd from an excellent piece of musick. This is an advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are stationary, as the latter cannot well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.<br>
<br>
His writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his enemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions, delivered in preaching, might have been afterwards explain'd or qualifi'd by supposing others that might have accompani'd them, or they might have been deny'd; but litera scripta manet. Critics attack'd his writings violently, and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and prevent their increase; so that I am of opinion if he had never written anything, he would have left behind him a much more numerous and important sect, and his reputation might in that case have been still growing, even after his death, as there being nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower character, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have possessed.<br>
<br>
My business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances growing daily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as being for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces. I experienced, too, the truth of the observation, ""that after getting the first hundred pound, it is more easy to get the second,"" money itself being of a prolific nature.<br>
<br>
The partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd to engage in others, and to promote several of my workmen, who had behaved well, by establishing them with printing-houses in different colonies, on the same terms with that in Carolina. Most of them did well, being enabled at the end of our term, six years, to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves, by which means several families were raised. Partnerships often finish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that mine were all carried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our articles, everything to be done by or expected from each partner, so that there was nothing to dispute, which precaution I would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteem partners may have for, and confidence in each other at the time of the contract, little jealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in the care and burden of the business, etc., which are attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences.<br>

<br>
DEFENSE OF THE PROVINCE<br>
<br>
block-IHAD, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two, things that I regretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleat education of youth; no militia, nor any college. I therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time, thinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person to superintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him; but he, having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries, which succeeded, declin'd the undertaking; and, not knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie awhile dormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings, when collected.<br>
<br>
With respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against Great Britain, and being at length join'd by France, which brought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continued endeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the security of the province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people. To promote this, I first wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled Plain Truth, in which I stated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and discipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose in a few days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose. The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect. I was call'd upon for the instrument of association, and having settled the draft of it with a few friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned. The house was pretty full; I had prepared a number of printed copies, and provided pens and ink dispers'd all over the room. I harangued them a little on the subject, read the paper, and explained it, and then distributed the copies, which were eagerly signed, not the least objection being made.<br>
<br>
When the company separated, and the papers were collected, we found above twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersed in the country, the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand. These all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed themselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, and met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and other parts of military discipline. The women, by subscriptions among themselves, provided silk colours, which they presented to the companies, painted with different devices and mottos, which I supplied.<br>

The officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment, being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, I declin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person, and man of influence, who was accordingly appointed. I then propos'd a lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town, and furnishing it with cannon. It filled expeditiously, and the battery was soon erected, the merlons being fram'd of logs and fill'd with earth. We bought some old cannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we wrote to England for more, soliciting, at the same time, our proprietaries for some assistance, tho' without much expectation of obtaining it.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., and myself were sent to New York by the associators, commission'd to borrow some cannon of Governor Clinton. He at first refus'd us peremptorily; but at dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he softened by degrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few more bumpers he advanc'd to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly conceded eighteen. They were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we soon transported and mounted on our battery, where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, and among the rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier.<br>

""I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier""<br>
My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association. Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the proclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of Heaven on our undertaking. They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the proclamation. My education in New England, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some advantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into German,[81] printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province. This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association, and it would probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon interven'd.<br>
<br>
It was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these affairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in the Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. A young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished to succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being turn'd out. My answer to him was, that I had read or heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office, and never to refuse one when offer'd to him. ""I approve,"" says I, ""of his rule, and will practice it with a small addition; I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office. If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another, they shall take it from me. I will not, by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries."" I heard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election. Possibly, as they dislik'd my late intimacy with the members of council, who had join'd the governors in all the disputes about military preparations, with which the House had long been harass'd, they might have been pleas'd if I would voluntarily have left them; but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association, and they could not well give another reason.<br>
<br>
Indeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was not disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'd to assist in it. And I found that a much greater number of them than I could have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearly for the defensive. Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'd on the subject, and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe convinc'd most of their younger people.<br>
<br>
A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments. It had been propos'd that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock, then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, no money could be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal. The company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were Quakers, and eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctually attended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakers would join us, we were by no means sure of a majority. Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris, appear'd to oppose the measure. He expressed much sorrow that it had ever been propos'd, as he said Friends were all against it, and it would create such discord as might break up the company. We told him that we saw no reason for that; we were the minority, and if Friends were against the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to the usage of all societies, submit. When the hour for business arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing.<br>
<br>
While we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two of our Quaker members. They told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with us if there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case, and desir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could do without it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I went up, and after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay of another hour. This Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair. Not one of his opposing friends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize; and, at the expiration of the hour, we carri'd the resolution eight to one; and as, of the twenty-two <a href=""/8997659/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Quakers"" data-id=""8997659"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Quakers,</a> eight were ready to vote with us, and thirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were not inclin'd to oppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers sincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all regular members of that society, and in good reputation among them, and had due notice of what was propos'd at that meeting.<br>
<br>
The honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect, was one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation of defensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments. He put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service. He told me the following anecdote of his old master, William Penn, respecting defense. He came over from England, when a young man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It was war-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be an enemy. Their captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn, and his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance, and they might retire into the cabin, which they did, except James Logan,[82] who chose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun. The suppos'd enemy prov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not been required by the captain. This reproof, being before all the company, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, ""I being thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down? But thee was willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was danger.""<br>
<br>
My being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which were constantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever application was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for military purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on the one hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the Quakers, on the other, by compliance contrary to their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable. The common mode at last was, to grant money under the phrase of its being ""for the king's use,"" and never to inquire how it was applied.<br>
<br>
But, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was found not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, when powder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and the government of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsylvania, which was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they could not grant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds, to be put into the hands of the governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat or other grain. Some of the council, desirous of giving the House still further embarrassment, advis'd the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thing he had demanded; but he repli'd, ""I shall take the money, for I understand very well their meaning; other grain is gunpowder,"" which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to it.[83]<br>
<br>
It was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I had said to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, ""If we fail, let us move the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can have no objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a committee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is certainly a fire-engine."" ""I see,"" says he, ""you have improv'd by being so long in the Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain.""<br>
<br>
These embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from having establish'd and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was lawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards, however they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of what I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that of the Dunkers. I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare, soon after it appear'd. He complain'd to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd with abominable principles and practices to which they were utter strangers. I told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that, to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publish the articles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline. He said that it had been propos'd among them, but not agreed to, for this reason: ""When we were first drawn together as a society,"" says he, ""it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors; and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths. &gt;From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been improving, and our errors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement, and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from.""<br>
<br>
This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man traveling in foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and also the people in the fields on each side, but near him all appears clear, tho' in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them. To avoid this kind of embarrassment, the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public service in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing rather to quit their power than their principle.<br>
<br>
In order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742, invented an open stove[84] for the better warming of rooms, and at the same time saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering, I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my early friends, who, having an iron-furnace,[85] found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand. To promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled ""An Account of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their Construction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated; and all Objections that have been raised against the Use of them answered and obviated,"" etc. This pamphlet had a good effect. Gov'r. Thomas was so pleas'd with the construction of this stove, as described in it, that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years; but I declin'd it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.<br>
<br>
An ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet, and working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the machine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there, and made, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho' not always with the same success, which I never contested, as having no desire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The use of these fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the neighbouring colonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.<br>

PUBLIC SERVICES AND DUTIES<br>
(1749-1753)<br>
block-PEACE being concluded, and the association business therefore at an end, I turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy. The first step I took was to associate in the design a number of active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the next was to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania. This I distributed among the principal inhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting an academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years; by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I remember right, than five thousand pounds.<br>
<br>
In the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication, not as an act of mine, but of some publick-spirited gentlemen, avoiding as much as I could, according to my usual rule, the presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.<br>
<br>
The subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution, chose out of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed Mr. Francis,[86] then attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutions for the government of the academy; which being done and signed, a house was hired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think, in the same year, 1749.<br>
<br>
The scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small, and we were looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated, with intention to build, when Providence threw into our way a large house ready built, which, with a few alterations, might well serve our purpose. This was the building before mentioned, erected by the hearers of Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the following manner.<br>
<br>
It is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by people of different sects, care was taken in the nomination of trustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested, that a predominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect, contrary to the original intention. It was therefore that one of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one Presbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case of vacancy by death, were to fill it by election from among the contributors. The Moravian happen'd not to please his colleagues, and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect. The difficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect, by means of the new choice.<br>
<br>
Several persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to. At length one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely an honest man, and of no sect at all, which prevailed with them to chuse me. The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abat'd, and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging some other debts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly. Being now a member of both sets of trustees, that for the building and that for the academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to discharge the debt, to keep forever open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers, according to the original intention, and maintain a free-school for the instruction of poor children. Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises; and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and different rooms above and below for the several schools, and purchasing some additional ground, the whole was soon made fit for our purpose, and the scholars remov'd into the building. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and superintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private business, having the year before taken a very able, industrious, and honest partner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted, as he had work'd for me four years. He took off my hands all care of the printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits. The partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both.<br>
<br>
The trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a charter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributions in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the Assembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was established the present University of Philadelphia.[87] I have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning, now near forty years, and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receiv'd their education in it, distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities, serviceable in public stations, and ornaments to their country.<br>
<br>
When I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I flatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortune I had acquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence's apparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes, every part of our civil government, and almost at the same time, imposing some duty upon me. The governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me of the common council, and soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent them in Assembly. This latter station was the more agreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were often so unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with making magic squares or circles, or anything to avoid weariness; and I conceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good. I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by all these promotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning, they were great things to me; and they were still more pleasing, as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion, and by me entirely unsolicited.<br>
<br>
The office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending a few courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding that more knowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessary to act in that station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusing myself by my being oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the Assembly. My election to this trust was repeated every year for ten years, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, or signifying, either directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen. On taking my seat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk.<br>
<br>
The year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians at Carlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing that they should nominate some of their members, to be join'd with some members of council, as commissioners for that purpose.[88] The House named the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd, we went to Carlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.<br>
<br>
As those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so, are very quarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbad the selling any liquor to them; and when they complain'd of this restriction, we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty, we would give them plenty of rum when business was over. They promis'd this, and they kept their promise, because they could get no liquor, and the treaty was conducted very orderly, and concluded to mutual satisfaction. They then claim'd and received the rum; this was in the afternoon: they were near one hundred men, women, and children, and were lodg'd in temporary cabins, built in the form of a square, just without the town. In the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter. We found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square; they were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting. Their dark-colour'd bodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire, running after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there was no appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging. At midnight a number of them came thundering at our door, demanding more rum, of which we took no notice.<br>
<br>
The next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us that disturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology. The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum; and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying, ""The Great Spirit, who made all things, made everything for some use, and whatever use he design'd anything for, that use it should always be put to. Now, when he made rum, he said, 'Let this be for the Indians to get drunk with,' and it must be so."" And, indeed, if it be the design of Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means. It has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the sea-coast.<br>

""In the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter""<br>
In 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent design, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the reception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the province or strangers. He was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in America, and at first not well understood, he met but with small success.<br>
<br>
At length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no such thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without my being concern'd in it. ""For,"" says he, ""I am often ask'd by those to whom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this business? And what does he think of it? And when I tell them that I have not (supposing it rather out of your line), they do not subscribe, but say they will consider of it."" I enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme, and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation, I not only subscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others. Previously, however, to the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in such cases, but which he had omitted.<br>
<br>
The subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but, beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition for it, which was done. The country members did not at first relish the project; they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city, and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv'd of it. My allegation on the contrary, that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they considered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.<br>
<br>
On this I form'd my plan; and, asking leave to bring in a bill for incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was obtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the bill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the important clause a conditional one, viz., ""And be it enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen their managers and treasurer, and shall have raised by their contributions a capital stock of——value (the yearly interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital, free of charge for diet, attendance, advice, and medicines), and shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the Assembly for the time being, that then it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker, and he is hereby required, to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds, in two yearly payments, to the treasurer of the said hospital, to be applied to the founding, building, and finishing of the same.""<br>
<br>
This condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had oppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expense, agreed to its passage; and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. The subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the design into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon erected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful, and flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political manoeuvers, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having made some use of cunning.<br>
<br>
It was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent[89], came to me with a request that I would assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians, who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield. Unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequently soliciting their contributions, I absolutely refus'd. He then desired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons I knew by experience to be generous and public-spirited. I thought it would be unbecoming in me, after their kind compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to be worried by other beggars, and therefore refus'd also to give such a list. He then desir'd I would at least give him my advice. ""That I will readily do,"" said I; ""and, in the first place, I advise you to apply to all those whom you know will give something; next, to those whom you are uncertain whether they will give anything or not, and show them the list of those who have given; and, lastly, do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken."" He laugh'd and thank'd me, and said he would take my advice. He did so, for he ask'd of everybody, and he obtain'd a much larger sum than he expected, with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meeting-house that stands in Arch-street.<br>
<br>
Our city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire, so that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pav'd with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the subject, I was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd with stone between the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was on each side next the houses. This, for some time, gave an easy access to the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav'd, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.<br>
<br>
After some inquiry, I found a poor, industrious man, who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign'd, and for a time well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose.<br>
<br>
After some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone,[90] and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door, that the people were first impress'd with the idea of enlighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascrib'd to me, but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supply'd with from London. Those we found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning, and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily repair'd.<br>
<br>
I have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhall[91] have in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps. But, these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro' them, the other use, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought of; and therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated.<br>
<br>
The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd, when in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have known, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ'd that the streets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away; but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to mud, and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was with great labour rak'd together and thrown up into carts open above, the sides of which suffered some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.<br>
<br>
a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom<br>
An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street,[92] one morning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she appeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness. I ask'd who employ'd her to sweep there; she said, ""Nobody, but I am very poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentle-folkses doors, and hopes they will give me something."" I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I would give her a shilling; this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for the shilling. From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could scarce believe that the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle; and the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean.<br>
<br>
I then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time. And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided into two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is thereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking. My proposal, communicated to the good doctor, was as follows:<br>
<br>
""For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of London and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mud rak'd up at other times, each in the several streets and lanes of his round; that they be furnish'd with brooms and other proper instruments for these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service.<br>
<br>
""That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at proper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usually opened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall also carry it all away.<br>
<br>
""That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'd high upon wheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being cover'd with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit the water to drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, water making the greatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be plac'd at convenient distances, and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrows; they remaining where plac'd till the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought to draw them away.""<br>
<br>
I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the dust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very practicable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho' it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly, of the duty on candles, and the high price of tallow.<br>
<br>
Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small importance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument. With these sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city I love, having lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America.<br>
<br>
Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America as his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from the postmaster-general in England. The American office never had hitherto paid anything to that of Britain. We were to have six hundred pounds a year between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary; some of these were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us. But it soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak of the ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the post-office of Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv'd from it—not one farthing!<br>
<br>
The business of the post-office occasion'd my taking a journey this year to New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their own motion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts. Yale College, in Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment. Thus, without studying in any college, I came to partake of their honours. They were conferr'd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy.<br>

ALBANY PLAN OF UNION<br>
<br>
block-IN 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress of commissioners from the different colonies was, by an order of the Lords of Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their country and ours. Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv'd the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June.<br>
<br>
In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense, and other important general purposes. As we pass'd thro' New York, I had there shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being fortified by their approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before the Congress. It then appeared that several of the commissioners had form'd plans of the same kind. A previous question was first taken, whether a union should be established, which pass'd in the affirmative unanimously. A committee was then appointed, one member from each colony, to consider the several plans and report. Mine happen'd to be preferr'd, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported.<br>
<br>
JOIN or DIE.<br>
By this plan the general government was to be administered by a president-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the several colonies, met in their respective assemblies. The debates upon it in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business. Many objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces. Its fate was singular; the assemblies did not adopt it, as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in England it was judg'd to have too much of the democratic. The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd, supposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of the provinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and to draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on America. My plan, with my reasons in support of it, is to be found among my political papers that are printed.<br>
<br>
Being the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with Governor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies, so united, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves; there would then have been no need of troops from England; of course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it occasioned, would have been avoided. But such mistakes are not new; history is full of the errors of states and princes.<br>

Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion.<br>
<br>
The Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly, expressed his approbation of the plan, ""as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention."" The House, however, by the management of a certain member, took it up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not very fair, and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to my no small mortification.<br>

QUARRELS WITH THE PROPRIETARY GOVERNORS<br>
<br>
block-IN my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I had been before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, ""No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly."" ""My dear friend,"" says he, pleasantly, ""how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid them."" He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful in argumentative conversation. He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion, while sitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise; for, in the course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which would be of more use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to Boston.<br>
<br>
In returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, by which it appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the House were already in high contention; and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retain'd the government. I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees always desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as his messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and, as he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natur'd a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasion'd by the contest, and we often din'd together.<br>
<br>
One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street<br>
One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street. ""Franklin,"" says he, ""you must go home with me and spend the evening; I am to have some company that you will like;"" and, taking me by the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine, after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the idea of Sancho Panza,[93] who, when it was proposed to give him a government, requested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not agree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who sat next to me, says, ""Franklin, why do you continue to side with these damn'd Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor would give you a good price."" ""The governor,"" says I, ""has not yet blacked them enough."" He, indeed, had laboured hard to blacken the Assembly in all his messages, but they wip'd off his colouring as fast as he laid it on, and plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the government.<br>
<br>
These public quarrels[94] were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province, with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused; and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions. The Assemblies for three years held out against this injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last. At length Captain Denny, who was Governor Morris's successor, ventured to disobey those instructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter.<br>
<br>
But I am got forward too fast with my story: there are still some transactions to be mention'd that happened during the administration of Governor Morris.<br>
<br>
War being in a manner commenced with France, the government of Massachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point,[95] and sent Mr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to New York, to solicit assistance. As I was in the Assembly, knew its temper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to me for my influence and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which was well received. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid out in provisions. But the governor refusing his assent to their bill (which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown), unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary, the Assembly, tho' very desirous of making their grant to New England effectual, were at a <a href=""/9002757/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Loss-how-to-accomplish-it"" data-id=""9002757"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">loss how to accomplish it</a>. Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent, but he was obstinate.<br>
<br>
I then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor, by orders on the trustees of the Loan office, which, by law, the Assembly had the right of drawing. There was, indeed, little or no money at that time in the office, and therefore I propos'd that the orders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent. With these orders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be purchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions, but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen. Thus this important affair was by my means completed. Mr. Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home highly pleas'd with this success of his embassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship.<br>

BRADDOCK'S EXPEDITION<br>
<br>
block-THE British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for that purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages. Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived violent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence, and of which they propos'd to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on this journey.<br>
<br>
We found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro' the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din'd with him daily, and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had before his arrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his operations. When I was about to depart, the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appear'd that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition. The general and all the officers were surpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary.<br>
<br>
I happen'd to say I thought it was pity they had not been landed rather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his waggon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, ""Then you, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them for us; and I beg you will undertake it."" I ask'd what terms were to be offer'd the owners of the waggons, and I was desir'd to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary. This I did, and they were agreed to, and a commission and instructions accordingly prepar'd immediately. What those terms were will appear in the advertisement I publish'd as soon as I arriv'd at Lancaster, which being, from the great and sudden effect it produc'd, a piece of some curiosity, I shall insert it at length, as follows:<br>
<br>
""Advertisement.<br>
""Lancaster, April 26, 1755.<br>
<br>
""Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each waggon, and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the service of his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's Creek, and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to empower me to contract for the hire of the same, I hereby give notice that I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day to next Wednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday morning till Friday evening, where I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams, or single horses, on the following terms, viz.: 1. That there shall be paid for each waggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen shillings per diem; and for each able horse with a pack-saddle, or other saddle and furniture, two shillings per diem; and for each able horse without a saddle, eighteen pence per diem. 2. That the pay commence from the time of their joining the forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before the 20th of May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for their travelling to Will's Creek and home again after their discharge. 3. Each waggon and team, and every saddle or pack horse, is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner; and in case of the loss of any waggon, team, or other horse in the service, the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid. 4. Seven days' pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of each waggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if required, and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by the paymaster of the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time to time, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers of waggons, or persons taking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses. 6. All oats, Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp, more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to be taken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for the same.<br>

""Friends and Countrymen,<br>
<br>
""Being occasionally[96] at the camp at Frederic a few days since, I found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages, which had been expected from this province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.<br>
<br>
""It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties, to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted, and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them.<br>
<br>
""I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these counties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they are in, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means. The people of these back counties have lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should continue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and twenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king's money.<br>
<br>
""The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march above twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, as they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's sake, always placed where they can be most secure, whether in a march or in a camp.<br>
<br>
""If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects to his majesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make it easy to yourselves; for three or four of such as cannot separately spare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver, may do it together, one furnishing the waggon, another one or two horses, and another the driver, and divide the pay proportionately between you; but if you do not this service to your king and country voluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you, your loyalty will be strongly suspected. The king's business must be done; so many brave troops, come so far for your defense, must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you; waggons and horses must be had; violent measures will probably be used, and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it, and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.<br>
<br>
""I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except the satisfaction of endeavouring to do good, I shall have only my labour for my pains. If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not likely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with a body of soldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose, which I shall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly your friend and well-wisher,<br>
<br>
""B. Franklin.""<br>
<br>
I received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed in advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but that sum being insufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more, and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred and fifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp. The advertisement promised payment according to the valuation, in case any waggon or horse should be lost. The owners, however, alleging they did not know General Braddock, or what dependence might be had on his promise, insisted on my bond for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.<br>
<br>
While I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers of Colonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern for the subalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and could ill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was to be purchas'd. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavour procuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of my intention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the Assembly, who had the disposition of some public money, warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments. My son, who had some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter. The committee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted by my son, the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons. They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing<br>
<br>
6 lbs. loaf sugar.	1 Gloucester cheese.<br>
6 lbs. good Muscovado do.	1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good butter.<br>
1 lb. good green tea.	2 doz. old Madeira wine.<br>
1 lb. good bohea do.	2 gallons Jamaica spirits.<br>
6 lbs. good ground coffee.	1 bottle flour of mustard.<br>
6 lbs. chocolate.	2 well-cur'd hams.<br>
1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.	1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.<br>
1-2 lb. pepper.	6 lbs. rice.<br>
1 quart best white wine	6 lbs. raisins.<br>
1 quart best white wine vinegar.<br>
<br>
These twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses, each parcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer. They were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindness acknowledg'd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the most grateful terms. The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account of disbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him. I undertook this also, and was busily employ'd in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for the service of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling, of which I sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few days before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving the remainder to the next account. I consider this payment as good luck, having never been able to obtain that remainder, of which more hereafter.<br>
<br>
This general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made a figure as a good officer in some European war. But he had too much self-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops, and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians. George Croghan, our Indian interpreter, join'd him on his march with one hundred of those people, who might have been of great use to his army as guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly; but he slighted and neglected them, and they gradually left him.<br>
<br>
In conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of his intended progress. ""After taking Fort Duquesne,""[97] says he, ""I am to proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac,[98] if the season will allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days; and then I see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara."" Having before revolv'd in my mind the long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road, to be cut for them thro' the woods and bushes, and also what I had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois country, I had conceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign. But I ventur'd only to say, ""To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne, with these fine troops, so well provided with artillery, that place not yet completely fortified, and as we hear with no very strong garrison, can probably make but a short resistance. The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians, who, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them; and the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make, may expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance, cannot come up in time to support each other.""<br>
<br>
He smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, <a href=""/8765651/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/These-savages-may-indeed-be-a-formidable-enemy-to-your-raw-american-militia"" data-id=""8765651"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">""These savages may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia,</a> but upon the king's regular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should make any impression."" I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession, and said no more. The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by heavy fire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered, the general hurried the troops up to their assistance, which was done in great confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the fire came upon their flank: the officers, being on horseback, were more easily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed; and then, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.<br>
<br>
The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from <a href=""/8765689/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Ambuscades"" data-id=""8765689"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">ambuscades</a> of Indians<br>
The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; their example was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general, being wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr. Shirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and baggage. The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp, and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd him and all his people; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men, and the enemy who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred Indians and French together, instead of proceeding, and endeavouring to recover some of the lost honour, he ordered all the stores, ammunition, etc., to be destroy'd, that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements, and less lumber to remove. He was there met with requests from the governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he would post his troops on the frontier, so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants; but he continued his hasty march thro' all the country, not thinking himself safe till he arrived at Philadelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him. This whole transaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the <a href=""/8765696/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Prowess"" data-id=""8765696"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">prowess</a> of British regulars had not been well founded.[99]<br>
<br>
In their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the settlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining the people if they remonstrated. This was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any. How different was the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march thro' the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to Virginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple.<br>
<br>
Captain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and, being grievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'd with him to his death, which happen'd in a few days, told me that he was totally silent all the first day, and at night only said, ""Who would have thought it?"" That he was silent again the following day, saying only at last, ""We shall better know how to deal with them another time""; and dy'd in a few minutes after.<br>
<br>
The secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions, and correspondence, falling into the enemy's hands, they selected and translated into French a number of the articles, which they printed, to prove the hostile intentions of the British court before the declaration of war. Among these I saw some letters of the general to the ministry, speaking highly of the great service I had rendered the army, and recommending me to their notice. David Hume,[100] too, who was some years after secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France, and afterward to General Conway, when secretary of state, told me he had seen among the papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly recommending me. But, the expedition having been unfortunate, my service, it seems, was not thought of much value, for those recommendations were never of any use to me.<br>
<br>
As to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants, and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted. This he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'd to their masters, on my application. Dunbar, when the command devolv'd on him, was not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on his retreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he had enlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that head. He promised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few days on his march to New York, he would there deliver their men to them. They accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'd to perform his promise, to their great loss and disappointment.<br>
<br>
As soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to pay. Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley,[101] and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, and they must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to sue me. General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering payment. They amounted to near twenty thousand pound, which to pay would have ruined me.<br>
<br>
Before we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to me with a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a grand firework, which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne. I looked grave, and said it would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice. They seem'd surpris'd that I did not immediately comply with their proposal. ""Why the d——l!"" says one of them, ""you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be taken?"" ""I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty."" I gave them the reasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had been prepared. Dr. Bond, on some other occasion afterward, said that he did not like Franklin's forebodings.<br>
<br>
Governor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with message after message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them into the making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province, without taxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause, now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success, the danger and necessity being greater. The Assembly, however, continu'd firm, believing they had justice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In one of the last, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his propos'd amendment was only of a single word. The bill express'd ""that all estates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the proprietaries not excepted."" His amendment was, for not read only: a small, but very material alteration. However, when the news of this disaster reached England, our friends there whom we had taken care to furnish with all the Assembly's answers to the governor's messages, rais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions; some going so far as to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province, they forfeited their right to it. They were intimidated by this, and sent orders to their receiver-general to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for such purpose.<br>
<br>
This, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their share of a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause, which passed accordingly. By this act I was appointed one of the commissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds. I had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and had, at the same time, drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia, which I carried thro' the House without much difficulty, as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at their liberty. To promote the association necessary to form the militia, I wrote a dialogue,[102] stating and answering all the objections I could think of to such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought, great effect.<br>

FRANKLIN'S DEFENSE OF THE FRONTIER<br>
<br>
block-WHILE the several companies in the city and country were forming, and learning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to take charge of our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts. I undertook this military business, tho' I did not conceive myself well qualified for it. He gave me a commission with full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to be given to whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raising men, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My son, who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army rais'd against Canada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me. The Indians had burned Gnadenhut,[103] a village settled by the Moravians, and massacred the inhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one of the forts.<br>
<br>
In order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem, the chief establishment of those people. I was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade; they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and had even plac'd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them. The armed brethren, too, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town. In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies, I had suppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. He answer'd me that it was not one of their established principles, but that, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thought to be a principle with many of their people. On this occasion, however, they, to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few. It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'd the Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.<br>
<br>
It was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business of building forts. I sent one detachment toward the Minisink, with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the country, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions; and I concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, where a fort was tho't more immediately necessary. The Moravians procur'd me five waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.<br>
<br>
Just before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been driven from their plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supply of firearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle. I gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition. We had not march'd many miles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; there were no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'd near night at the house of a German, where, and in his barn, we were all huddled together, as wet as water could make us. It was well we were not attack'd in our march, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort, and our men could not keep their gun locks[104] dry. The Indians are dexterous in contrivances for that purpose, which we had not. They met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned, and killed ten of them. The one who escap'd inform'd that his and his companions' guns would not go off, the priming being wet with the rain.<br>
<br>
We had not march'd many miles before it began to rain<br>
The next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd at the desolated Gnadenhut. There was a saw-mill near, round which were left several piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves; an operation the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had no tents. Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found there, who had been half interr'd by the country people.<br>
<br>
The next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the circumference measuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would require as many palisades to be made of trees, one with another, of a foot diameter each. Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our men being dexterous in the use of them, great despatch was made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter. Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end. While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round, of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,[105] we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other day that the men could not work.<br>
<br>
Our axes ... were immediately set to work to cut down trees<br>
""Our axes ... were immediately set to work to cut down trees""<br>
This gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, they are best content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'd and cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in continual ill-humour, which put me in mind of a sea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work; and, when his mate once told him that they had done everything, and there was nothing further to employ them about, ""Oh,"" says he, ""make them scour the anchor.""<br>
<br>
This kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense against Indians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now posted securely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'd out in parties to scour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians, but we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings. There was an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mention. It being winter, a fire was necessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discover'd their position at a distance. They had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter, and somewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods. With these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes, and we observ'd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies, made by their laying all round, with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which, with them, is an essential point. This kind of fire, so manag'd, could not discover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it appear'd that their number was not great, and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.<br>
<br>
We had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty, who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations. When they enlisted, they were promised, besides pay and provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd out to them, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and I observed they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon which I said to Mr. Beatty, ""It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers, you would have them all about you."" He liked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended; so that I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for non-attendance on divine service.<br>
<br>
I had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'd with provisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor, acquainting me that he had call'd the Assembly, and wished my attendance there, if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no longer necessary. My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me by their letters to be, if possible, at the meeting, and my three intended forts being now compleated, and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that protection, I resolved to return; the more willingly, as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced in Indian war, being on a visit to our establishment, consented to accept the command. I gave him a commission, and, parading the garrison, had it read before them, and introduc'd him to them as an officer who, from his skill in military affairs, was much more fit to command them than myself; and, giving them a little exhortation, took my leave. I was escorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few days to recover from the fatigue I had undergone. The first night, being in a good bed, I could hardly sleep, it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two.<br>
<br>
While at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of the Moravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind to me. I found they work'd for a common stock, ate at common tables, and slept in common dormitories, great numbers together. In the dormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances all along just under the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change of air. I was at their church, where I was entertain'd with good musick, the organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets, etc. I understood that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men, women, and children, as is our common practice, but that they assembled sometimes the married men, at other times their wives, then the young men, the young women, and the little children, each division by itself. The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were plac'd in rows on benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman. The discourse seem'd well adapted to their capacities, and was delivered in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good. They behav'd very orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy, which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient exercise.<br>
<br>
I inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was true that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us'd only in particular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself dispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class, who consulted the elder ladies that govern'd the young women. As these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were suitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for example, it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to. I objected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. ""And so they may,"" answer'd my informer, ""if you let the parties chuse for themselves;"" which, indeed, I could not deny.<br>
<br>
Being returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went on swimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty generally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chose their captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law. Dr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those endeavours. I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue; however, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoy his opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases. The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment, which I this time accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but we paraded about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of artillery, who had been furnished with six brass field-pieces, which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute. The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house, and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door, which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus. And my new honour proved not much less brittle; for all our commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England.<br>
<br>
During this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out on a journey to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town, as far as the Lower Ferry. Just as I was getting on horseback they came to my door, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all in their uniforms. I had not been previously acquainted with the project, or I should have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd at their appearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying me. What made it worse was, that, as soon as we began to move, they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way. Somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor, and it gave him great offense. No such honour had been paid him when in the province, nor to any of his governors; and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal, which may be true for aught I know, who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.<br>
<br>
This silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me, which was before not a little, on account of my conduct in the Assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which I had always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it. He accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the King's service, preventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form of the bills for raising money, and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force. He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the House, in which I, as a member, had so large a share, there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself, and we never had any personal difference. I have sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me, for the answers it was known I drew up to his messages, might be the effect of professional habit, and that, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit, he for the proprietaries and I for the Assembly. He would, therefore, sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho' not often, take my advice.<br>
<br>
We acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions; and, when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent in haste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties. I forget now the advice I gave; but I think it was, that Dunbar should be written to, and prevail'd with, if possible, to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection, till, by reinforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceed on the expedition. And, after my return from the frontier, he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops, for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me as general. I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he profess'd to have, and I believe his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments; but probably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men, and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay them, and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate. Finding me not so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropt, and he soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain Denny.<br>

<br>
SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS<br>
<br>
block-bEFORE I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under this new governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation.<br>
<br>
In 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was lately arrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments. They were imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, being on a subject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me. Soon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'd from Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society[106] of London, a present of a glass tube, with some account of the use of it in making such experiments. I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I had seen at Boston; and, by much practice, acquired great readiness in performing those, also, which we had an account of from England, adding a number of new ones. I say much practice, for my house was continually full, for some time, with people who came to see these new wonders.<br>
<br>
To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which they furnish'd themselves, so that we had at length several performers. Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbour, who, being out of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which the experiments were rang'd in such order, and accompanied with such explanations in such method, as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following. He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which all the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicely form'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he went thro' the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd up some money. In the West India islands, indeed, it was with difficulty the experiments could be made, from the general moisture of the air.<br>
<br>
Oblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc., I thought it right he should be inform'd of our success in using it, and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments. He got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions. One paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of lightning with electricity,[107] I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintance of mine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote me word that it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs. The papers, however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them of too much value to be stifled, and advis'd the printing of them. Mr. Collinson then gave them to Cave for publication in his Gentleman's Magazine; but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface. Cave, it seems, judged rightly for his profit, for by the additions that arrived afterward, they swell'd to a quarto volume, which has had five editions, and cost him nothing for copy-money.<br>
<br>
It was, however, some time before those papers were much taken notice of in England. A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the Count de Buffon,[108] a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in France, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard[109] to translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris. The publication offended the Abbé Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophy to the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form'd and publish'd a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue. He could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system. Afterwards, having been assur'd that there really existed such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had doubted, he wrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly address'd to me, defending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments, and of the positions deduc'd from them.<br>
<br>
I once purpos'd answering the abbé, and actually began the answer; but, on consideration that my writings contained a description of experiments which anyone might repeat and verify, and if not to be verifi'd, could not be defended; or of observations offer'd as conjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them; and reflecting that a dispute between two persons, writing in different languages, might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thence misconceptions of one another's meaning, much of one of the abbé's letters being founded on an error in the translation, I concluded to let my papers shift for themselves, believing it was better to spend what time I could spare from public business in making new experiments, than in disputing about those already made. I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my friend M. le Roy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause and refuted him; my book was translated into the Italian, German, and Latin languages; and the doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the abbé; so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, except Monsieur B——, of Paris, his élève and immediate disciple.<br>
<br>
What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds. This engag'd the public attention everywhere. M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur'd in that branch of science, undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were performed before the king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them. I will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv'd in the success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the histories of electricity.<br>
<br>
Dr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend, who was of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem my experiments were in among the learned abroad, and of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in England. The society, on this, resum'd the consideration of the letters that had been read to them; and the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of them, and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject, which he accompanied with some praise of the writer. This summary was then printed in their Transactions; and some members of the society in London, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod, and acquainting them with the success, they soon made me more than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me. Without my having made any application for that honour, they chose me a member, and voted that I should be excus'd the customary payments, which would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and ever since have given me their Transactions gratis. They also presented me with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley[110] for the year 1753, the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president, Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was highly honoured.<br>

<br>
AGENT OF PENNSYLVANIA IN LONDON<br>
<br>
block-OUR new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the before mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the city. He accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been long acquainted with my character. After dinner, when the company, as was customary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he took me aside into another room, and acquainted me that he had been advis'd by his friends in England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who was capable of giving him the best advice, and of contributing most effectually to the making his administration easy; that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understanding with me, and he begged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be in his power. He said much to me, also, of the proprietor's good disposition towards the province, and of the advantage it might be to us all, and to me in particular, if the opposition that had been so long continu'd to his measures was dropt, and harmony restor'd between him and the people; in effecting which, it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself; and I might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc. The drinkers, finding we did not return immediately to the table, sent us a decanter of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of, and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises.<br>
<br>
My answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances, thanks to God, were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me; and that, being a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any; that, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that, whenever the public measures he propos'd should appear to be for the good of the people, no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this, that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the people; that I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his professions of regard to me, and that he might rely on everything in my power to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hampered with.<br>
<br>
On this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards came to do business with the Assembly, they appear'd again, the disputes were renewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition, being the penman, first, of the request to have a communication of the instructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which may be found in the votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterward publish'd. But between us personally no enmity arose; we were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first information that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was esteem'd one of the best political writers in England; had been employed in the dispute[111] between Prince Frederic and the king, and had obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the Dunciad,[112] but his prose was thought as good as any man's.<br>
<br>
The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown, resolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me their agent to go over to England, to present and support the petition. The House had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the king's use (ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which the governor absolutely refus'd to pass, in compliance with his instructions.<br>
<br>
I had agreed with Captain Morris, of the packet at New York, for my passage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv'd at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavour an accommodation between the governor and Assembly, that his majesty's service might not be obstructed by their dissensions. Accordingly, he desir'd the governor and myself to meet him, that he might hear what was to be said on both sides. We met and discussed the business. In behalf of the Assembly, I urged all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers of that time, which were of my writing, and are printed with the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his instructions, the bond he had given to observe them, and his ruin if he disobey'd, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if Lord Loudoun would advise it. This his lordship did not chuse to do, though I once thought I had nearly prevail'd with him to do it; but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose, declaring that he would spare none of the king's troops for the defense of our frontiers, and that, if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves, they must remain expos'd to the enemy.<br>
<br>
I acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting them with a set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights, and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights, but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro' force, against which we protested, they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions. This of course the governor pass'd, and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage. But, in the meantime, the packet had sailed with my sea-stores, which was some loss to me, and my only recompense was his lordship's thanks for my service, all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share.<br>
<br>
He set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching the packet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two then remaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, I requested to know the precise time, that I might not miss her by any delay of mine. His answer was, ""I have given out that she is to sail on Saturday next; but I may let you know, entre nous, that if you are there by Monday morning, you will be in time, but do not delay longer."" By some accidental hindrance at a ferry, it was Monday noon before I arrived, and I was much afraid she might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor, and would not move till the next day. One would imagine that I was now on the very point of departing for Europe. I thought so; but I was not then so well acquainted with his lordship's character, of which indecision was one of the strongest features. I shall give some instances. It was about the beginning of April that I came to New York, and I think it was near the end of June before we sail'd. There were then two of the packet-boats, which had been long in port, but were detained for the general's letters, which were always to be ready to-morrow. Another packet arriv'd; she too was detain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was expected. Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been there longest. Passengers were engaged in all, and some extremely impatient to be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time) for fall goods; but their anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship's letters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needs write abundantly.<br>
<br>
Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thence express with a packet from Governor Denny for the general. He delivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my inquiring when he was to return, and where he lodg'd, that I might send some letters by him. He told me he was order'd to call to-morrow at nine for the general's answer to the governor, and should set off immediately. I put my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight after I met him again in the same place. ""So, you are soon return'd, Innis?"" ""Return'd! no, I am not gone yet."" ""How so?"" ""I have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready."" ""Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his escritoire."" ""Yes,"" says Innis, ""but he is like St. George on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on."" This observation of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for, when in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt[113] gave it as one reason for removing this general, and sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe, that the minister never heard from him, and could not know what he was doing.<br>
<br>
This daily expectation of sailing, and all the three packets going down to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought it best to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, and they be left behind. There, if I remember right, we were about six weeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more. At length the fleet sail'd, the general and all his army on board, bound to Louisburg, with the intent to besiege and take that fortress; all the packet-boats in company ordered to attend the general's ship, ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready. We were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part, and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for England. The other two packets he still detained, carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then altered his mind as to besieging Louisburg, and returned to New York, with all his troops, together with the two packets above mentioned, and all their passengers! During his absence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontier of that province, and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation.<br>
<br>
I saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded one of those packets. He told me that, when he had been detain'd a month, he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul, to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for a packet-boat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom. He was asked how long time that would require. He answered, three days. The general replied, ""If you can do it in one day, I give leave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day after to-morrow."" So he never obtain'd leave, though detained afterwards from day to day during full three months.<br>
<br>
I saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so enrag'd against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at New York, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again, that he swore he would sue him for damages. Whether he did or not, I never heard; but, as he represented the injury to his affairs, it was very considerable.<br>
<br>
On the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrusted[114] with so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. General Shirley, on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in carrying them into execution. Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies with his great army, left them totally expos'd while he paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost, besides, he derang'd all our mercantile operations, and distress'd our trade, by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions, on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtain'd by the enemy, but in reality for beating down their price in favour of the contractors, in whose profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion only, he had a share. And, when at length the embargo was taken off, by neglecting to send notice of it to Charlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain'd near three months longer, whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home.<br>
<br>
Shirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man unacquainted with military business. I was at the entertainment given by the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him the command. Shirley, tho' thereby superseded, was present also. There was a great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one among them very low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it as I sat by him, I said, ""They have given you, sir, too low a seat."" ""No matter,"" says he, ""Mr. Franklin, I find a low seat the easiest.""<br>
<br>
While I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I receiv'd all the accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish'd to Braddock, some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain'd from the different persons I had employ'd to assist in the business. I presented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the balance. He caus'd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who, after comparing every article with its voucher, certified them to be right; and the balance due for which his lordship promis'd to give me an order on the paymaster. This was, however, put off from time to time; and tho' I call'd often for it by appointment, I did not get it. At length, just before my departure, he told me he had, on better consideration, concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors. ""And you,"" says he, ""when in England, have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will be paid immediately.""<br>
<br>
I mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense I had been put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was not right I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money I had advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service, ""O, Sir,"" says he, ""you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill his own pockets."" I assur'd him that was not my case, and that I had not pocketed a farthing; but he appear'd clearly not to believe me; and, indeed, I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such employments. As to my balance, I am not paid it to this day, of which more hereafter.<br>
<br>
Our captain of the packet had boasted much, before we sailed, of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification. After many conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captain ordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as possible. We were, passengers included, about forty persons. While we stood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour far behind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected, that she was loaded too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had been all plac'd forward; these he therefore order'd to be mov'd further aft, on which the ship recover'd her character, and proved the best sailer in the fleet.<br>
<br>
The captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots, which is accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on board, as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that it was impossible, and that no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there must have been some error in the division of the log-line, or some mistake in heaving the log.[115] A wager ensu'd between the two captains, to be decided when there should be sufficient wind. Kennedy thereupon examin'd rigorously the log-line, and, being satisfi'd with that, he determin'd to throw the log himself. Accordingly some days after, when the wind blew very fair and fresh, and the captain of the packet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd she then went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment, and own'd his wager lost.<br>
<br>
The above fact I give for the sake of the following observation. It has been remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building, that it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailing ship has been exactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, on the contrary, remarkably dull. I apprehend that this may partly be occasion'd by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system; and the same vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain, shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another. Besides, it scarce ever happens that a ship is form'd, fitted for the sea, and sail'd by the same person. One man builds the hull, another rigs her, a third lades and sails her. No one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others, and, therefore, cannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole.<br>
<br>
Even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have often observ'd different judgments in the officers who commanded the successive watches, the wind being the same. One would have the sails trimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that they seem'd to have no certain rule to govern by. Yet I think a set of experiments might be instituted; first, to determine the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest place for the masts; then the form and quantity of sails, and their position, as the wind may be; and, lastly, the disposition of the lading. This is an age of experiments, and I think a set accurately made and combin'd would be of great use. I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some ingenious philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.<br>
<br>
Sailboat<br>
We were several times chas'd in our passage, but out-sail'd every thing, and in thirty days had soundings. We had a good observation, and the captain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that, if we made a good run in the night, we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morning, and by running in the night might escape the notice of the enemy's privateers, who often cruis'd near the entrance of the channel. Accordingly, all the sail was set that we could possibly make, and the wind being very fresh and fair, we went right before it, and made great way. The captain, after his observation, shap'd his course, as he thought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George's Channel, which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron. This indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us.<br>
<br>
We had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called, ""Look well out before there,"" and he as often answered, ""Ay, ay""; but perhaps had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time, they sometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for he did not see a light just before us, which had been hid by the studding-sails from the man at the helm, and from the rest of the watch, but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discover'd, and occasion'd a great alarm, we being very near it, the light appearing to me as big as a cartwheel. It was midnight, and our captain fast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeing the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails standing; an operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected. This deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses, and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in America if I should live to return there.<br>
<br>
In the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were near our port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight. About nine o'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath, the town of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fields that surrounded it. This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasion'd.<br>
<br>
I set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopt a little by the way to view Stonehenge[116] on Salisbury Plain, and Lord Pembroke's house and gardens, with his very curious antiquities at Wilton. We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757.[117]<br>
<br>
As soon as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me, I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended, and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain. He was against an immediate complaint to government, and thought the proprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who might possibly be induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends, to accommodate matters amicably. I then waited on my old friend and correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that John Hanbury, the great Virginia merchant, had requested to be informed when I should arrive, that he might carry me to Lord Granville's,[118] who was then President of the Council and wished to see me as soon as possible. I agreed to go with him the next morning. Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to that nobleman's, who receiv'd me with great civility; and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in America and discourse thereupon, he said to me: ""You Americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution; you contend that the king's instructions to his governors are not laws, and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion. But those instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony. They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; they are then considered, debated, and perhaps amended in Council, after which they are signed by the king. They are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land, for the king is the Legislator of the Colonies,""[119] I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me. I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs. He assur'd me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so, however, and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings. I recollected that about 20 years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the ministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions laws in the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons, for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty, till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they had refus'd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves.<br>
<br>
With his keen insight into human nature and his consequent knowledge of American character, he foresaw the inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of England. This conversation with Grenville makes these last pages of the Autobiography one of its most important parts.<br>
<br>
After some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries, they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable. We then went into consideration of our several points of complaint, which I enumerated. The proprietaries justify'd their conduct as well as they could, and I the Assembly's. We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement. However, it was concluded that I should give them the heads of our complaints in writing, and they promis'd then to consider them. I did so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly. He was a proud, angry man, and as I had occasionally in the answers of the Assembly treated his papers with some severity, they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression, he had conceived a mortal enmity to me, which discovering itself whenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal that he and I should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves, and refus'd treating with anyone but them. They then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the Attorney and Solicitor-General for their opinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days, during which time I made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General. What it was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not communicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not such.<br>
<br>
We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement<br>
""We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement""<br>
The want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not having address'd the paper to them with their assum'd titles of True and Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, which I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper, the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing, what in conversation I had delivered viva voce.<br>
<br>
But during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'r Denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people, which was the grand point in dispute, they omitted answering the message.<br>
<br>
When this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent. Accordingly they petitioned the king in Council, and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act, and two by me in support of it. They alledg'd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force, and the proprietaries, who were in odium with the people, left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined. We reply'd that the act had no such intention, and would have no such effect. That the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably, and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves. This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides, except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal, for that the money, £100,000, being printed and given to the king's use, expended in his service, and now spread among the people, the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many, and the total discouragement of future grants, and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms. On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel, rose, and beckoning me took me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading, and asked me if I was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act. I said certainly. ""Then,"" says he, ""you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point."" I answer'd, ""None at all."" He then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse, his lordship's proposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of the Province for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber, where finally the law was allowed to pass. Some changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law, but the Assembly did not think them necessary; for one year's tax having been levied by the act before the order of Council arrived, they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors, and on this committee they put several particular friends of the proprietaries. After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'd a report that they found the tax had been assess'd with perfect equity.<br>
<br>
The Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the engagement, as an essential service to the Province, since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country. They gave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietaries were enraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'd him out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe. He, however, having done it at the instance of the General, and for His Majesty's service, and having some powerful interest at court, despis'd the threats and they were never put in execution....

ELECTRICAL KITE<br>
<br>
To Peter Collinson<br>
[Philadelphia], Oct. 19, 1752.<br>
<br>
Sir,<br>
<br>
As frequent mention is made in public papers from Europe of the success of the Philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings, &amp;c., it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed, that the same experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia, though made in a different and more easy manner, which is as follows:<br>
<br>
Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large, thin silk handkerchief when extended; tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross, so you have the body of a kite; which being properly accommodated with a tail, loop, and string, will rise in the air, like those made of paper; but this being of silk, is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder-gust without tearing. To the top of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or more above the wood. To the end of the twine, next the hand, is to be tied a silk ribbon, and where the silk and twine join, a key may be fastened. This kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears to be coming on, and the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet; and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window. As soon as any of the thunder clouds come over the kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, and the kite, with all the twine will be electrified, and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger. And when the rain has wet the kite and twine, so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle. At this key the phial may be charged; and from electric fire thus obtained, spirits may be kindled, and all the electric experiments be performed, which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated.<br>

(From ""Father Abraham's Speech,"" forming the preface to Poor Richard's Almanac for 1758.)<br>
<br>
It would be thought a hard Government that should tax its People one-tenth Part of their Time, to be employed in its Service. But Idleness taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent in absolute Sloth, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent in idle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life. Sloth, like Rust, consumes faster than Labor wears; while the used key is always bright, as Poor Richard says. But dost thou love Life, then do not squander Time, for that's the stuff Life is made of, as Poor Richard says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting that The sleeping Fox catches no Poultry, and that There will be sleeping enough in the Grave, as Poor Richard says.<br>
<br>
If Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be, as Poor Richard says, the greatest Prodigality; since, as he elsewhere tells us, Lost Time is never found again; and what we call Time enough, always proves little enough: Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do more with less Perplexity. Sloth makes all Things difficult, but Industry all easy, as Poor Richard says; and He that riseth late must trot all Day, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night; while Laziness travels so slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him, as we read in Poor Richard, who adds, Drive thy Business, let not that drive thee; and Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy, and wise.<br>
<br>
Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will die fasting.<br>
<br>
There are no Gains without Pains.<br>
<br>
He that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hath an Office of Profit and Honor; but then the Trade must be worked at, and the Calling well followed, or neither the Estate nor the Office will enable us to pay our Taxes.<br>
<br>
What though you have found no Treasure, nor has any rich Relation left you a Legacy, Diligence is the Mother of Good-luck, as Poor Richard says, and God gives all Things to Industry.<br>
<br>
One To-day is worth two To-morrows, and farther, Have you somewhat to do To-morrow, do it To-day.<br>
<br>
If you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle? Are you then your own Master, be ashamed to catch yourself idle.<br>
<br>
Stick to it steadily; and you will see great Effects, for Constant Dropping wears away Stones, and by Diligence and Patience the Mouse ate in two the Cable; and Little Strokes fell great Oaks.<br>
<br>
Methinks I hear some of you say, Must a Man afford himself no Leisure? I will tell thee, my friend, what Poor Richard says, Employ thy Time well, if thou meanest to gain Leisure; and, since thou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour. Leisure, is Time for doing something useful; this Leisure the diligent Man will obtain, but the lazy Man never; so that, as Poor Richard says, A Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things.<br>
<br>
Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee; and again, If you would have your business done, go; if not, send.<br>
<br>
If you would have a faithful Servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.<br>
<br>
A little Neglect may breed great Mischief: adding, for want of a Nail the Shoe was lost; for want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and for want of a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken and slain by the Enemy; all for the want of Care about a Horse-shoe Nail.<br>
<br>
So much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one's own Business; but to these we must add Frugality.<br>
<br>
What maintains one Vice, would bring up two Children. You may think perhaps, that a little Tea, or a little Punch now and then, Diet a little more costly, Clothes a little finer, and a little Entertainment now and then, can be no great Matter; but remember what Poor Richard says, Many a Little makes a Mickle.<br>
<br>
Beware of little expenses; A small Leak will sink a great Ship; and again, Who Dainties love, shall Beggars prove; and moreover, Fools make Feasts, and wise Men eat them.<br>
<br>
Buy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy Necessaries.<br>
<br>
If you would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some; for, he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing.<br>
<br>

<br>
Lying rides upon Debt's Back.<br>
<br>
Poverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: 'Tis hard for an empty Bag to stand upright.<br>
<br>
And now to conclude, Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools will learn in no other, and scarce in that; for it is true, we may give Advice, but we cannot give Conduct, as Poor Richard says: However, remember this, They that won't be counseled, can't be helped, as Poor Richard says: and farther, That if you will not hear Reason, she'll surely rap your Knuckles.<br>
<br>
THE WHISTLE<br>
<br>
To Madame Brillon<br>
Passy, November 10, 1779.<br>
<br>
I am charmed with your description of Paradise, and with your plan of living there; and I approve much of your conclusion, that, in the meantime, we should draw all the good we can from this world. In my opinion, we might all draw more good from it than we do, and suffer less evil, if we would take care not to give too much for whistles. For to me it seems, that most of the unhappy people we meet with, are become so by neglect of that caution.<br>
<br>
You ask what I mean? You love stories, and will excuse my telling one of myself.<br>
<br>
When I was a child of seven year old, my friends, on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children; and being charmed with the sound of a whistle, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth; put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the money; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that I cried with <a href=""/9003174/Benjamin-franklin-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-part-two/Vexation"" data-id=""9003174"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">vexation</a>; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure.<br>
<br>
This, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuing on my mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, Don't give too much for the whistle; and I saved my money.<br>
<br>
As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle.<br>
<br>
When I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time in attendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends, to attain it, I have said to myself, This man gives too much for his whistle.<br>
<br>
When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by neglect, He pays, indeed, said I, too much for his whistle.<br>
<br>
If I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of accumulating wealth, Poor man, said I, you pay too much for your whistle.<br>
<br>
When I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporeal sensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, Mistaken man, said I, you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you give too much for your whistle.<br>
<br>
If I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, Alas! say I, he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle.<br>
<br>
When I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl married to an ill-natured brute of a husband, What a pity, say I, that she should pay so much for a whistle!<br>
<br>
In short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whistles.<br>
<br>
Yet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people, when I consider, that, with all this wisdom of which I am boasting, there are certain things in the world so tempting, for example, the apples of King John, which happily are not to be bought; for if they were put to sale by auction, I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase, and find that I had once more given too much for the whistle.<br>
<br>
Adieu, my dear friend, and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with unalterable affection,<br>
<br>
B. Franklin.<br>
<br>
A LETTER TO SAMUEL MATHER<br>
<br>
Passy, May 12, 1784.<br>
<br>
Revd Sir,<br>
<br>
It is now more than 60 years since I left Boston, but I remember well both your father and grandfather, having heard them both in the pulpit, and seen them in their houses. The last time I saw your father was in the beginning of 1724, when I visited him after my first trip to Pennsylvania. He received me in his library, and on my taking leave showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage, which was crossed by a beam overhead. We were still talking as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I turning partly towards him, when he said hastily, ""Stoop, stoop!"" I did not understand him, till I felt my head hit against the beam. He was a man that never missed any occasion of giving instruction, and upon this he said to me, ""You are young, and have the world before you; stoop as you go through it, and you will miss many hard thumps."" This advice, thus beat into my head, has frequently been of use to me; and I often think of it, when I see pride mortified, and misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high.<br>
<br>
B. Franklin.<br>

So much I wanna talk about<br>
But I ain't got no one to talk to (Shit, I don't)<br>

But somehow it always falls through<br>
And I know that I get rough<br>
But I just wanna feel love sometimes<br>

Real shit, bitch<br>

"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
I said, ""Remember this moment""<br>
In the back of my mind<br>
The time we stood with our shaking hands<br>
The crowds in stands went wild<br>
We were the kings and the queens<br>
And they read off our names<br>
The night you danced like you knew our lives<br>
Would never be the same<br>
You held your head like a hero<br>
On a history book page<br>
It was the end of a decade<br>
But the start of an age<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Long live the walls we crashеd through<br>
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
I was scrеaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""<br>
And bring on all the pretenders<br>
One day, we will be remembered<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I said, ""Remember this feeling""<br>
I pass the pictures around<br>
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines<br>
Wishin' for right now<br>
We are the kings and the queens<br>
You traded your baseball cap for a crown<br>
When they gave us our trophies<br>
And we held them up for our town<br>
And the cynics were outraged<br>
Screaming, ""This is absurd""<br>
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves<br>
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""<br>
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid<br>
Long live all the mountains we moved<br>
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you<br>
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""<br>
And bring on all the pretenders<br>
One day, we will be remembered<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Hold on to spinning around<br>
Confetti falls to the ground<br>
May these memories break our fall<br>
Will you take a moment? Promise me this<br>
That you'll stand by me forever<br>
But if, God forbid, fate should step in<br>
And force us into a goodbye<br>
If you have children some day<br>
When they point to the pictures<br>
Please, tell 'em my name<br>
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild<br>
Tell 'em how I hope they shine<br>
Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
I had the time of my life with you<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Long, long live the walls we crashed through<br>
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""<br>
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid<br>
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""<br>

"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire<br>
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest<br>
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you<br>
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything<br>
But boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything<br>
But I got nothing here without you<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
So one last time<br>
I need to be the one who takes you home<br>
One more time<br>
I promise after that, I'll let you go<br>
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart<br>
All I really care is you wake up in my arms<br>
One last time<br>
I need to be the one who takes you home<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it<br>
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it<br>
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily<br>
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful<br>

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything<br>

But I got nothing here without you, baby<br>

[Verse 1: Aran, <i>All</i>]<br>
A hopeless romantic all my life<br>
Surrounded by couples all the time<br>
I guess I should take it as a sign<br>
(<i>Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?</i>)<br>

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, <i>All</i>]<br>
I'm feelin' lonely (<i>Lonely</i>)<br>
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (<i>Hold me</i>)<br>
Now I'm crying in my room<br>
So skeptical of love (<i>Say what you say, but I want it more</i>)<br>
But still, I want it more, more, more<br>
<br>
[Chorus: All]<br>
I gave a second chance to Cupid<br>
But now I'm left here feelin' stupid<br>
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real<br>
Cupid is so dumb<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Aran]<br>
I look for his arrows every day<br>
I guess he got lost or flew away<br>
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""No Se Va - En Vivo""]<br>
<br>
[Verso 1]<br>
Tan fácil que es enamorarme<br>
Y tan difícil olvidarte<br>
Porque la vida me juraste<br>
Y hoy te busco y tú no estás<br>
Aunque me duela ver tu foto<br>
Entreno a mi corazón roto<br>
Por si mañana te vuelva a encontrar<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Ya no sé disimular<br>
Llamo y no te puedo hablar<br>
Tu recuerdo no se va<br>
No se va, no se va<br>
Algo en ti quiere volver<br>
Y algo en mí te va a encontrar<br>
Tu recuerdo no se va<br>
No se va, no se va<br>
<br>
[Refrán]<br>
Quédate otra vez, quédate toda la noche<br>
Quédate otra vеz, quédate más de las doce<br>
Quédatе otra vez que mi corazón no olvida<br>
Amor, así no se olvida<br>
Y no se va, no se va, no se va<br>
Quédate otra vez, quédate toda la vida<br>
Quédate otra vez, tú eres mi bala perdida<br>
Quédate otra vez que mi corazón no olvida<br>
Amor, así no se olvida<br>
Y no se va, no se va, no se va<br>

Perder mis ojos cuando bailes<br>
Sentir mil besos en el aire<br>
Fue suficiente para convencerme<br>
De que, si te vas<br>
Te buscaré, aunque suene loco<br>
De Bogotá hasta Buenos Aires<br>
¿Cómo te explico que no sé olvidar?<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Ya no sé disimular<br>
Te amo y no te puedo hablar<br>

No me pidas disculpas que la culpa es mía</i><br>

¿Por qué no tengo un corazón así?<br>

¿Por qué el que me tocó a mí es frágil?<br>
Por eso lo rompiste fácil<br>
<i>Y yo queriendo un corazón así<br>

Pero no soy como tú, yo aquí sí me estoy muriendo</i><br>

Recuerdo tu totito moja'o en mi balcón (Moja'o en mi balcón)<br>
Mi instinto me decía que tú era' un error (Un error)<br>
De toa' mis decisione' tú fuiste la peor (La peor)<br>
Tú me encanta', pero no me conviene' (Conviene')<br>
Habla' toa' esas mierda' en las rede' (En las rede')<br>
Pero tú y tu novio saben que yo soy el nene (Jaja)<br>
Yo sé que no es lo mismo cuando te viene' (Brr)<br>
Este bicho y esta perla él no la tiene (¡Jaja!; jejeje)<br>
Yo sé que tú me extraña' y yo te extraño aunque no hablamo'<br>
To' el mundo te habla mierda, pero yo vuelvo y te gano (Te gano)<br>
Toda' tus amiga' te dicen que soy un diablo (Uah)<br>
Pero tú me conoce', soy más puro que un kilo 'e Pablo (Uah)<br>
Uah, oh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh<br>
'Taba viendo nuestras foto' (Nuestras foto')<br>
Y pensando como los loco'<br>
Yo vuelvo y te lambo esos tres roto' (Jaja), brr<br>
Friki, rompimo' una picky (Una picky)<br>
Por la mita', vete conmigo, miti-miti (Miti-miti)<br>
Baby, no siga' jugando conmigo (Conmigo)<br>
Que te la meto como Curry en Golden State City<br>
<br>
[Coro: Chencho Corleone &amp; <i>Brray</i>, <b>Ambos</b>]<br>
Pensando como los loco'<br>
Que si no e' tu cuerpo, más ninguno toco (Más ninguno toco)<br>
Lo de nosotro' fue fuera de lo normal, tú dime si me equivoco (Dime si me equivoco, oh-oh)<br>
<i>Y yo quisiera volver, pero e' que hice tan poco</i> (<i>Poco</i>)<br>
<b>No me conviene tampoco<br>
Prefiero morir con el corazón roto</b> (<i>Pu, pu</i>)<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Brray]<br>
Mi vida se inunda y me monto en el Jetsco<br>
Hasta los papelone', baby, te los agradezco (Gracia')<br>
Toa' estas depresiones sé que me las merezco<br>
Porque siempre estoy pidiendo mucho más de lo que ofrezco (Brr)<br>
Pero sin ti me enamoré de la vida<br>
Lo que sube, siempre baja, y si le bajo ríete de mi caída (Je)<br>
Me dicen que te han visto con las nuevas amiga'<br>
Más feliz haciendo fila, qué mentira<br>
Y me gradué de pendejo sin birrete y sin la toga (Pu)<br>
A lo mejor siempre fuiste la cabra y yo la soga<br>
En drogas se nos caen los polvo' como la soda<br>
Ese culo se me antoja, pero no ando en paradoja (No)<br>
Ma, mi corazón roto cámbialo por otro<br>
Y dile a tu amiguita que no le queda mi foto (Yo se la empurr)<br>
Baby, si ante' no perdona', pero si es que estoy devoto<br>
Y con algun toto más rico el golpe boto (Sheesh)<br>
<br>
[Verso 3: Chencho Corleone &amp; <i>Anuel AA</i>]<br>
Ya pasó, tu tiempo ya pasó<br>
Pues pa'l carajo si pa' ti esto no vale na'<br>
Tú me quiere' ver rogar y eso nunca va a pasar<br>
Te quiero lejo', yo sé que tú la va' a pagar (<i>Brr</i>)<br>
<br>
[Coro: Anuel AA &amp; <i>Chencho Corleone</i>]<br>
Pensando como los loco'<br>
Que si no e' tu cuerpo, más ninguno toco (Toco)<br>

<i>Y yo quisiera volver, pero es que hice tan poco</i> (Poco)<br>
<i>No me conviene tampoco<br>
Prefiero morir con el corazón roto</i> (Roto)<br>
<br>
[Verso 4: Ryan Castro &amp; <i>Jhayco</i>]<br>
Yo creo que caímo' en la rutina (Ah-ah)<br>
La frialdad nos congeló los sentimiento' (Qué gonorrea)<br>
Y si te sientes sola, yo estoy solo también (Mi amor)<br>
Si tiene' roto el cora, yo estoy roto también (Chao y hasta luego)<br>
Y tú lo llamas ""orgullo"", pero, baby, eso es amor propio (Es amor propio)<br>
Tú está' diciendo que yo tengo gata' demás y a ninguna le copio, yeah (Awoo)<br>
Si nos parchábamo' a la F, cuando no tenía nada, ni jefe<br>
Si otra' te hablan mierda, no te deje'<br>
Yo todos los día' te cantaba y hasta te mostraba mis refe<br>
Pero no no' vemos hace meses<br>
Yo quisiera volver, pero eso no nos conviene<br>
Yo que soñaba contigo viendo crecer los nene'<br>
Mi corazón quiere llamarte y mi mente me detiene<br>
Hasta la gente se burla y me ve como un meme (<i>La Presión</i>)<br>
<br>
[Verso 5: Jhayco]<br>
Baby, paga el entierro, que<br>
Si no e' el culo tuyo, no lo quiero<br>
¿Qué puñeta hago ahora los 14 de febrero?<br>
Me tiene' depresivo, Canserbero<br>
Y la mente alcohólica, moña' exótica'<br>
Te hiciste un OnlyFans y 'tás erótica<br>
De noche con una migraña cronic<br>
Tú me llama' y llego rápido a lo Sonic<br>
Chavo' en la fanny, pero el corazón empty<br>
Veo tu foto y siempre te ves tempting<br>
Sí, te hiciste el cuerpo y ahora te ves racing<br>
¿Tú aprendiste inglés? Pues, bebé, te ves amazing<br>
¿Cuándo me va' a contestar?<br>
Baby, si me cogen preso algún día, aunque sea mándame una postal<br>
Contéstame los voice' (Voice')<br>
Te dedico una canción de Prince Royce<br>
Chequea el celular<br>
Tú a mí no me quieres, ese e' el punto final<br>
Yo puse par de tuits, pero no es pa' manipular<br>
Y sé que una puñeta te tiene que importar<br>
<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""La Víctima""]<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Ya pensé<br>
Dos veces antes de que tú me la juegues con que ya yo no sé<br>
No te hagas la víctima, tú sabes claramente lo que hiciste<br>
Cometimos errores<br>
Pero esta vez no vuelvo porque te pasas de lanza<br>
<br>
[Verso 1]<br>
Y nunca fue bastante para que tú te calmaras en la puteada y ver<br>
El hombre que te amaba no lo valoraste y te pelaste por feria<br>
Ahora quieres buscarme<br>
Pero yo ya no puedo porque ando por todas partes<br>
Y AMG en mi caravana con toda la plebada fui pa' la privada aquella<br>
Quise empedarme para no pensarte y resultaste estar ahí<br>
En medio de otros brazos<br>
Y yo pensé que me quieras<br>
Y otra vez con tus mentiras<br>
<br>
[Interludio]<br>
La víctima<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Ya pensé<br>
Dos veces antes de que tú me la juegues con que ya yo no sé<br>
No te hagas la víctima, tú sabes claramente lo que hiciste<br>
Cometimos errores<br>
Pero esta vez no vuelvo porque te pasas de lanza<br>
<br>
[Verso 2]<br>
Y de una vez agarra tus cosas, pélate a la verga<br>
No quiero volverte ver<br>
Y vive esa vida que tanto querías<br>
Malagradecida eres<br>
Me quebraste el corazón porque pensé que me querías<br>
Y otra vez con tus mentiras</p>

"<p>[Letra de ""NUEVA VIDA""]<br>
<br>
[Intro]<br>
¡Chau!<br>
<br>
[Verso 1]<br>
La noche ha llegado, ya estoy preparado<br>
<a href=""/29531793/Peso-pluma-nueva-vida/Un-buen-white-recluse-a-mi-me-ven-forjando"" data-id=""29531793"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Un buen White Recluse a mí me ven forjando</a><br>
Siempre bien tranquilo, nunca ando de ondeado<br>
Me gusta ser gente, yo nunca me rajo<br>
Veintitrés y ya ando de arriba pa' abajo<br>
Voy por buen camino, siempre lo he notado<br>
Buenos amigos los que a mí me han rodeado<br>
Siempre al cien con los que me echaron la mano<br>
Rodeado de lujos y no materiales<br>
Siempre buena vida me dieron mis padres<br>
El viejo en el cielo siempre ha de guiarme<br>
Para que en la vida salgan bien los planes<br>
<br>
[Interludio]<br>
Ahí le va, jefazo<br>
Hasta el cielo, viejo<br>
Pura Doble P, viejo, a la verga<br>
¡Chau!<br>
<br>
[Verso 2]<br>
Hoy todo ha cambiado, no voy a negarlo<br>
Pensamientos nuevos son los que ya cargo<br>
Una nueva vida la que me estoy dando<br>
Poco a poco envidias se van presentando<br>
El tiempo es muy sabio y responde preguntas<br>
Y a mí no me asusta cargar con la duda<br>
Siempre bien pendiente mi compita Rulas<br>
Soy de perfil bajo, así nadie me busca<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Nadie me busca</p>
