"<p>[Verse 1: Liam]<br>
You're insecure, don't know what for<br>
You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door<br>
Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)<br>
Bein' the way that you are is enough<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]<br>
Everyone else in the room can see it<br>
Everyone else but you<br>
<br>
[Chorus: All, <i>Harry</i>]<br>
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else<br>
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed<br>
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell<br>
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful<br>
If only you saw what I can see<br>
You'll understand why I want you so desperately<br>
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe<br>

THE AIR-SHIP<br>
<br>
         <a href=""/5064958/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Imagine-if-you-can"" data-id=""5064958"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Imagine, if you can</a>, a small room, hexagonal in shape, <a href=""/5064970/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Like-the-cell-of-a-bee"" data-id=""5064970"" class=""has_comments has_verified_annotation"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">like the cell of a bee</a>. It is lighted neither by window nor by lamp, yet it is filled with a soft radiance. There are no apertures for ventilation, yet the air is fresh. There are no musical instruments, and yet, at the moment that my meditation opens, this room is throbbing with melodious sounds. <a href=""/5064991/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/An-armchair-is-in-the-centre-by-its-side-a-reading-deskthat-is-all-the-furniture"" data-id=""5064991"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">An armchair is in the centre, by its side a reading-desk—that is all the furniture</a>.

        An electric bell rang.<br>
        The woman touched a switch and the music was silent.<br>
         ""I suppose I must see who it is"", she thought, and set her chair in motion. <a href=""/4124428/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-chair-like-the-music-was-worked-by-machinery"" data-id=""4124428"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">The chair, like the music, was worked by machinery</a> and it rolled her to the other side of the room where the bell still rang importunately.<br>
         ""Who is it?"" she called. Her voice was irritable, for she had been interrupted often since the music began. She knew several thousand people; in certain directions <a href=""/5065829/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Human-intercourse"" data-id=""5065829"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">human intercourse</a> had advanced enormously.<br>

It only gave a general idea of people</a>—an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes, Vashti thought. <a href=""/5065994/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-imponderable-bloom"" data-id=""5065994"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">The imponderable bloom</a>, declared by a discredited philosophy to be the actual essence of intercourse, was rightly ignored by the Machine,<a href=""/5066007/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Just-as-the-imponderable-bloom-of-the-grape-was-ignored-by-the-manufacturers-of-artificial-fruit"" data-id=""5066007"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted""> just as the imponderable bloom of the grape was ignored by the manufacturers of artificial fruit</a>. Something ""good enough"" had long since been accepted by our race.<br>
         ""The truth is,"" he continued, ""that I want to see these stars again. They are curious stars. I want to see them not from the air-ship, but from the surface of the earth, as our ancestors did, thousands of years ago. <a href=""/4124477/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/I-want-to-visit-the-surface-of-the-earth"" data-id=""4124477"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">I want to visit the surface of the earth.""</a><br>
         She was shocked again.<br>
         ""Mother, you must come, if only to explain to me what is the harm of visiting the surface of the earth.""<br>
         ""No harm,"" she replied, controlling herself. ""But no advantage. The surface of the earth is only dust and mud; no life remains on it, and you would need a respirator, or the cold of the outer air would kill you. One dies immediately in the outer air.""<br>
         ""I know; of course I shall take all precautions.""<br>
         ""And besides—""<br>
         ""Well?""<br>
         She considered, and chose her words with care. Her son had a queer temper, and she wished to dissuade him from the expedition.<br>
         ""It is contrary to <a href=""/5066063/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-spirit-of-the-age"" data-id=""5066063"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the spirit of the age</a>,"" she asserted.<br>
         ""Do you mean by that, contrary to the Machine?""<br>
         ""In a sense, but—""<br>
         His image is the blue plate faded.<br>
         ""Kuno!""<br>
         He had isolated himself.<br>
         For a moment Vashti felt lonely.<br>
         <a href=""/5068710/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Then-she-generated-the-light"" data-id=""5068710"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Then she generated the light</a>, and the sight of her room, flooded with radiance and studded with electric buttons, revived her. There were buttons and switches everywhere—<a href=""/5068721/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Buttons-to-call-for-food-for-music-for-clothing"" data-id=""5068721"" class=""has_pending_edits"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">buttons to call for food, for music, for clothing</a>. There was the hot-bath button, by pressure of which a basin of (imitation) marble rose out of the floor, filled to the brim with a warm deodorized liquid. There was the cold-bath button. There was the button that produced literature. And there were of course the buttons by which she communicated with her friends. The room, though it contained nothing, was in touch with all that she cared for in the world.<br>
         Vashti's next move was to turn off the isolation switch, and all the accumulations of the last three minutes burst upon her. The room was filled with the noise of bells, and speaking-tubes. What was the new food like? Could she recommend it? Has she had any ideas lately? Might one tell her one's own ideas? Would she make an engagement to visit the public nurseries at an early date?—say this day month.<br>
         <a href=""/4124491/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/To-most-of-these-questions-she-replied-with-irritationa-growing-quality-in-that-accelerated-age"" data-id=""4124491"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">To most of these questions she replied with irritation—a growing quality in that accelerated age.</a> She said that the new food was horrible. That she could not visit the public nurseries through press of engagements. That she had no ideas of her own but had just been told one—that four stars and three in the middle were like a man: she doubted there was much in it. Then she switched off her correspondents, for it was time to deliver her lecture on Australian music.<br>
         <a href=""/5068752/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-clumsy-system-of-public-gatherings-had-been-long-since-abandoned"" data-id=""5068752"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">The clumsy system of public gatherings had been long since abandoned</a>; neither Vashti nor her audience stirred from their rooms. Seated in her armchair she spoke, while they in their armchairs heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well. She opened with a humorous account of music in the pre-Mongolian epoch, and went on to describe the great outburst of song that followed the Chinese conquest. Remote and primæval as were the methods of I-San-So and the Brisbane school, she yet felt (she said) that study of them might repay the musicians of today: they had freshness; they had, above all, ideas. Her lecture, which lasted ten minutes, was well received, and at its conclusion she and many of her audience listened to a lecture on the sea; there were ideas to be got from the sea; the speaker had donned a respirator and visited it lately. Then she <a href=""/5069387/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Fed"" data-id=""5069387"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">fed</a>, talked to many friends, had a bath, talked again, and summoned her bed.<br>
         <a href=""/4124560/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-bed-was-not-to-her-liking-it-was-too-large-and-she-had-a-feeling-for-a-small-bed-complaint-was-useless-for-beds-were-of-the-same-dimension-all-over-the-world-and-to-have-had-an-alternative-size-would-have-involved-vast-alterations-in-the-machine"" data-id=""4124560"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">The bed was not to her liking. It was too large, and she had a feeling for a small bed. Complaint was useless, for beds were of the same dimension all over the world, and to have had an alternative size would have involved vast alterations in the Machine.</a> Vashti isolated herself—it was necessary, for neither day nor night existed under the ground—and reviewed all that had happened <a href=""/5069409/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Since-she-had-summoned-the-bed-last"" data-id=""5069409"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">since she had summoned the bed last</a>. Ideas? Scarcely any. Events—was Kuno's invitation an event?<br>
         By her side, on the little reading-desk, was a survival from <a href=""/5069414/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-ages-of-litter"" data-id=""5069414"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the ages of litter</a>—one book. This was the Book of the Machine. In it were instructions against every possible contingency. If she was hot or cold or <a href=""/5069426/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Dyspeptic"" data-id=""5069426"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">dyspeptic</a> or at a loss for a word, she went to the book, and it told her which button to press. The Central Committee published it. <a href=""/5069428/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/In-accordance-with-a-growing-habit-it-was-richly-bound"" data-id=""5069428"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">In accordance with a growing habit, it was richly bound</a>.<br>
         Sitting up in the bed, she took it reverently in her hands. She glanced round the glowing room as if some one might be watching her. Then, half ashamed, half joyful, she murmured, ""O Machine! O Machine!"" and raised the volume to her lips. <a href=""/5069439/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Thrice-she-kissed-it"" data-id=""5069439"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Thrice she kissed it</a>, thrice inclined her head, thrice she felt the delirium of acquiescence. Her ritual performed, she turned to page 1367, which gave the times of the departure of the air-ships from the island in the southern hemisphere, under whose soil she lived, to the island in the northern hemisphere, whereunder lived her son.<br>
         She thought, ""I have not the time.""<br>
         <a href=""/5069448/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/She-made-the-room-dark-and-slept-she-awoke-and-made-the-room-light-she-ate-and-exchanged-ideas-with-her-friends-and-listened-to-music-and-attended-lectures-she-made-the-room-dark-and-slept"" data-id=""5069448"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">She made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music and attended lectures; she made the room dark and slept</a>. Above her, beneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not notice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth, carrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the invisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room light.<br>
         ""Kuno!""<br>
         ""I will not talk to you,"" he answered, ""until you come.""<br>
         ""Have you been on the surface of the earth since we spoke last?""<br>
         His image faded.<br>
         Again she consulted the book. She became very nervous and lay back in her chair palpitating. Think of her as without teeth or hair. Presently she directed the chair to the wall, and pressed an unfamiliar button. The wall swung apart slowly. Through the opening she saw a tunnel that curved slightly, so that its goal was not visible. Should she go to see her son, here was the beginning of the journey.<br>
         Of course she knew all about the communication system. There was nothing mysterious in it. She would summon a car and it would fly with her down the tunnel until it reached the lift that communicated with the air-ship station: the system had been in use for many, many years, long before the universal establishment of the Machine. And of course she had studied the civilization that had immediately preceded her own—the civilization that had mistaken the functions of the system, and had used it <a href=""/5069689/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/For-bringing-people-to-things"" data-id=""5069689"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">for bringing people to things</a>, instead of for bringing things to people. Those funny old days, when men went for change of air instead of changing the air in their rooms! And yet—she was frightened of the tunnel: she had not seen it since her last child was born. It curved—but not quite as she remembered; it was brilliant—but not quite as brilliant as a lecturer had suggested. Vashti was seized with <a href=""/5069697/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-terrors-of-direct-experience"" data-id=""5069697"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the terrors of direct experience</a>. She shrank back into the room, and the wall closed up again.<br>
         ""Kuno,"" she said, ""I cannot come to see you. I am not well.""<br>
         <a href=""/11539574/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Immediately-an-enormous-apparatus-fell-onto-her-out-of-the-ceiling-a-thermometer-was-automatically-laid-upon-her-heart-she-lay-powerless"" data-id=""11539574"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Immediately an enormous apparatus fell onto her out of the ceiling, a thermometer was automatically laid upon her heart. She lay powerless.</a> Cool pads soothed her forehead. Kuno had <a href=""/5069705/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Telegraphed"" data-id=""5069705"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">telegraphed</a> to her doctor.<br>
         So the human passions still blundered up and down in the Machine. Vashti drank the medicine that the doctor projected into her mouth, and the machinery retired into the ceiling. The voice of Kuno was heard asking how she felt.<br>
         ""Better."" Then with irritation: ""But why do you not come to me instead?""<br>
         ""Because I cannot leave this place.""<br>
         ""Why?""<br>
         ""Because, any moment, something tremendous may happen.""<br>
         ""Have you been on the surface of the earth yet?""<br>
         ""Not yet.""<br>
         ""Then what is it?""<br>
         <a href=""/5399334/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/I-will-not-tell-you-through-the-machine"" data-id=""5399334"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">""I will not tell you through the Machine.""</a><br>
         She resumed her life.<br>
         But she thought of Kuno as a baby, his birth, his removal to <a href=""/5069807/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-public-nurseries"" data-id=""5069807"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the public nurseries</a>, her own visit to him there, his visits to her—visits which stopped when the Machine had assigned him a room on the other side of the earth. ""Parents, duties of,"" said the book of the Machine, ""cease at the moment of birth. <a href=""/11539605/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/P422327483"" data-id=""11539605"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">P.422327483.</a>"" True, but there was something special about Kuno—<a href=""/5070585/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Indeed-there-had-been-something-special-about-all-her-children"" data-id=""5070585"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">indeed there had been something special about all her children</a>—and, after all, she must brave the journey if he desired it. And ""something tremendous might happen"". What did that mean? The nonsense of a youthful man, no doubt, but she must go. Again she pressed the unfamiliar button, again the wall swung back, and she saw the tunnel that curves out of sight. Clasping the Book, she rose, tottered onto the platform, and summoned the car. Her room closed behind her: the journey to the northern hemisphere had begun.<br>
         Of course it was perfectly easy. The car approached and in it she found armchairs exactly like her own. When she signaled, it stopped, and she tottered into the lift. One other passenger was in the lift, the first fellow creature she had seen face to face for months. <a href=""/4124571/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Few-travelled-in-these-days-for-thanks-to-the-advance-of-science-the-earth-was-exactly-alike-all-over-rapid-intercourse-from-which-the-previous-civilization-had-hoped-so-much-had-ended-by-defeating-itself-what-was-the-good-of-going-to-peking-when-it-was-just-like-shrewsbury-why-return-to-shrewsbury-when-it-would-all-be-like-peking-men-seldom-moved-their-bodies-all-unrest-was-concentrated-in-the-soul"" data-id=""4124571"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Few travelled in these days, for, thanks to the advance of science, the earth was exactly alike all over. Rapid intercourse, from which the previous civilization had hoped so much, had ended by defeating itself. What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul.</a><br>
         The air-ship service was a relic from the former age. It was kept up, because it was easier to keep it up than to stop it or to diminish it, but it now far exceeded the wants of the population. Vessel after vessel would rise from the <a href=""/5070609/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Vomitories"" data-id=""5070609"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">vomitories</a> of Rye or of Christchurch (I use the antique names), would sail into the crowded sky, and would draw up at the wharves of the south—empty. So nicely adjusted was the system, so independent of meteorology, that the sky, whether calm or cloudy, <a href=""/5070618/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Resembled-a-vast-kaleidoscope"" data-id=""5070618"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">resembled a vast kaleidoscope</a> whereon the same patterns periodically recurred. The ship on which Vashti sailed started now at sunset, now at dawn. But always, as it passed above Rheas, it would neighbour the ship that served between Helsingfors and the Brazils, and, every third time it surmounted the Alps, the fleet of Palermo would cross its track behind. Night and day, wind and storm, tide and earthquake, impeded man no longer. <a href=""/5070634/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/He-had-harnessed-leviathan"" data-id=""5070634"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">He had harnessed Leviathan</a>. All the old literature, with its praise of Nature, and its fear of Nature, rang false as the prattle of a child.<br>
         Yet as Vashti saw the vast flank of the ship, stained with exposure to the outer air, her horror of direct experience returned. It was not quite like the air-ship in the cinematophote. For one thing it smelt—not strongly or unpleasantly, but it did smell, and with her eyes shut she should have known that a new thing was close to her. Then she had to walk to it from the lift, had to submit to glances form the other passengers. The man in front dropped his Book—no great matter, but it disquieted them all. In the rooms, if the Book was dropped, the floor raised it mechanically, but the gangway to the air-ship was not so prepared, and the sacred volume lay motionless. They stopped—the thing was unforeseen—and the man, instead of picking up his property, felt the muscles of his arm to see how they had failed him. Then some one actually said with direct utterance: ""We shall be late""—and they trooped on board, Vashti treading on the pages as she did so.<br>
         Inside, her anxiety increased. The arrangements were old-fashioned and rough. <a href=""/5071320/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/There-was-even-a-female-attendant-to-whom-she-would-have-to-announce-her-wants-during-the-voyage"" data-id=""5071320"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">There was even a female attendant, to whom she would have to announce her wants during the voyage</a>. Of course a revolving platform ran the length of the boat, but she was expected to walk from it to her cabin. Some cabins were better than others, and she did not get the best. <a href=""/5453016/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/She-thought-the-attendant-had-been-unfair-and-spasms-of-rage-shook-her"" data-id=""5453016"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">She thought the attendant had been unfair, and spasms of rage shook her.</a> <a href=""/4124586/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-glass-valves-had-closed-she-could-not-go-back"" data-id=""4124586"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">The glass valves had closed, she could not go back.</a> She saw, at the end of the vestibule, the lift in which she had ascended going quietly up and down, empty. Beneath those corridors of shining tiles were rooms, tier below tier, reaching far into the earth, and in each room there sat a human being, eating, or sleeping, or producing ideas. And buried deep <a href=""/5071347/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/In-the-hive"" data-id=""5071347"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">in the hive</a> was her own room. Vashti was afraid.<br>
         ""O Machine! O Machine!"" she murmured,<a href=""/5071341/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/And-caressed-her-book-and-was-comforted"" data-id=""5071341"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted""> and caressed her Book, and was comforted</a>.<br>
         Then the sides of the vestibule seemed to melt together, as do the passages that we see in dreams; the lift vanished, the Book that had been dropped slid to the left and vanished, polished tiles rushed by like a stream of water, there was a slight jar, and the air-ship, issuing from its tunnel, soared above the waters of a tropical ocean.<br>
         <a href=""/4132371/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/It-was-night-for-a-moment-she-saw-the-coast-of-sumatra-edged-by-the-phosphorescence-of-waves-and-crowned-by-lighthouses-still-sending-forth-their-disregarded-beams"" data-id=""4132371"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">It was night. For a moment she saw the coast of Sumatra edged by the phosphorescence of waves, and crowned by lighthouses, still sending forth their disregarded beams</a>. These also vanished, and only the stars distracted her. They were not motionless, but swayed to and fro above her head, thronging out of one sky-light into another, as if the universe and not the air-ship was careening. And, as often happens on clear nights, they seemed now to be in perspective, now on a plane; now piled tier beyond tier into the infinite heavens, now concealing infinity, a roof limiting for ever the visions of men. In either case they seemed intolerable. ""Are we to travel in the dark?"" called the passengers angrily, and the attendant, who had been careless, generated the light, and pulled down the blinds of pliable metal. When the air-ships had been built, the desire to look direct at things still lingered in the world. Hence the extraordinary number of skylights and windows, and the proportionate discomfort to those who were civilized and refined. Even in Vashti’s cabin one star peeped through a flaw in the blind, and after a few hours' uneasy slumber, she was disturbed by an unfamiliar glow, which was the dawn.<br>
         Quick as the ship had sped westwards, <a href=""/5071377/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-earth-had-rolled-eastwards-quicker-still"" data-id=""5071377"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the earth had rolled eastwards quicker still</a>, and had dragged back Vashti and her companions towards the sun. Science could prolong the night, but only for a little, and those high hopes of neutralizing the earth’s diurnal revolution had passed, together with hopes that were possibly higher. To ""keep pace with the sun,"" or even to outstrip it, had been the aim of the civilization preceding this. Racing aeroplanes had been built for the purpose, capable of enormous speed, and steered by the greatest intellects of the epoch. Round the globe they went, round and round, westward, westward, round and round, amidst humanity’s applause. In vain. The globe went eastward quicker still, horrible accidents occurred, and the Committee of the Machine, at the time rising into prominence, declared the pursuit illegal, <a href=""/5071388/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Unmechanical"" data-id=""5071388"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">unmechanical</a>, and punishable by Homelessness.<br>
         Of Homelessness more will be said later.<br>
         Doubtless the Committee was right. Yet the attempt to ""defeat the sun"" aroused the last common interest that our race experienced about the heavenly bodies, or indeed about anything. It was the last time that men were compacted by thinking of a power outside the world. The sun had conquered, yet it was the end of his spiritual dominion. Dawn, midday, twilight, the zodiacal path, touched neither men’s lives nor their hearts, and science retreated into the ground, to concentrate herself upon problems that she was certain of solving.<br>
         So when Vashti found her cabin invaded by <a href=""/5071406/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/A-rosy-finger-of-light"" data-id=""5071406"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">a rosy finger of light</a>, she was annoyed, and tried to adjust the blind. But the blind flew up altogether, and she saw through the skylight small pink clouds, swaying against a background of blue, and as the sun crept higher, its radiance entered direct, brimming down the wall, like a golden sea. It rose and fell with the air-ship’s motion, just as waves rise and fall, but it advanced steadily, as a tide advances. Unless she was careful, it would strike her face. A spasm of horror shook her and she rang for the attendant. The attendant too was horrified, but she could do nothing; <a href=""/5071480/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/It-was-not-her-place-to-mend-the-blind"" data-id=""5071480"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">it was not her place to mend the blind</a>. She could only suggest that the lady should change her cabin, which she accordingly prepared to do.<br>
         People were almost exactly alike all over the world, but the attendant of the air-ship, perhaps owing to her exceptional duties, had grown a little out of the common. She had often to address passengers with direct speech, and this had given her a certain roughness and originality of manner. When Vashti swerved away from the sunbeams with a cry, she behaved barbarically—she put out her hand to steady her.<br>
         ""How dare you!"" exclaimed the passenger. ""<a href=""/5071411/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/You-forget-yourself"" data-id=""5071411"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">You forget yourself</a>!""<br>
         The woman was confused, and apologized for not having let her fall. People never touched one another. <a href=""/5371995/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-custom-had-become-obsolete-owing-to-the-machine"" data-id=""5371995"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">The custom had become obsolete, owing to the Machine.</a><br>
         ""Where are we now?"" asked Vashti haughtily.<br>
         ""We are over Asia,"" said the attendant, anxious to be polite.<br>
         ""Asia?""<br>
         ""You must excuse my common way of speaking. I have got into the habit of calling places over which I pass by their <a href=""/5071418/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Unmechanical"" data-id=""5071418"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">unmechanical</a> names.""<br>
         ""Oh, I remember Asia. The Mongols came from it.""<br>
         ""Beneath us, in the open air, stood a city that was once called <a href=""/5071432/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Simla"" data-id=""5071432"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Simla</a>.""<br>
         ""Have you ever heard of the Mongols and of the Brisbane school?""<br>
         ""No.""<br>
         ""Brisbane also stood in the open air.""<br>
         ""Those mountains to the right—let me show you them."" She pushed back a metal blind. The main chain of the Himalayas was revealed. ""They were once called <a href=""/5071444/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/The-roof-of-the-world"" data-id=""5071444"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the Roof of the World</a>, those mountains.""<br>
         ""What a foolish name!""<br>
         ""You must remember that, before the dawn of civilization, they seemed to be an impenetrable wall that touched the stars. It was supposed that no one but the gods could exist above their summits. <a href=""/5071452/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/How-we-have-advanced-thanks-to-the-machine"" data-id=""5071452"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!</a>""<br>
         ""How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!"" said Vashti.<br>
         ""How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!"" echoed the passenger who had dropped his Book the night before, and who was standing in the passage.<br>
         ""And that white stuff in the cracks?—what is it?""<br>
         ""I have forgotten its name.""<br>
         ""Cover the window, please. These mountains give me no ideas.""<br>
         The northern aspect of the Himalayas was in deep shadow: on the Indian slope the sun had just prevailed. The forests had been destroyed during the literature epoch for the purpose of making newspaper-pulp, but the snows were awakening to their morning glory, and clouds still hung on the breasts of <a href=""/5071463/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Kinchinjunga"" data-id=""5071463"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Kinchinjunga</a>. In the plain were seen the ruins of cities, with diminished rivers creeping by their walls, and by the sides of these were sometimes the signs of vomitories, marking the cities of today. Over the whole prospect air-ships rushed, crossing and intercrossing with incredible aplomb, and rising nonchalantly when they desired to escape the perturbations of the lower atmosphere and to traverse the Roof of the World.<br>
         ""We have indeed advance, thanks to the Machine,"" repeated the attendant, and hid the Himalayas behind a metal blind.<br>
         The day dragged wearily forward. The passengers sat each in his cabin, avoiding one another with an almost physical repulsion and longing to be once more under the surface of the earth. There were eight or ten of them, mostly young males, sent out from the public nurseries to inhabit the rooms of those who had died in various parts of the earth. The man who had dropped his Book was on the homeward journey. <a href=""/5071493/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/He-had-been-sent-to-sumatra-for-the-purpose-of-propagating-the-race"" data-id=""5071493"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">He had been sent to Sumatra for the purpose of propagating the race</a>. Vashti alone was travelling by her private will.<br>
         At midday she took a second glance at the earth. The air-ship was crossing another range of mountains, but she could see little, owing to clouds. Masses of black rock hovered below her, and merged indistinctly into grey. Their shapes were fantastic; <a href=""/5071534/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/One-of-them-resembled-a-prostrate-man"" data-id=""5071534"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">one of them resembled a prostrate man</a>.<br>

         In the evening she looked again. They were crossing a golden sea, in which lay many small islands and one peninsula. <a href=""/5071567/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/She-repeated-no-ideas-here-and-hid-greece-behind-a-metal-blind"" data-id=""5071567"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">She repeated, ""No ideas here,"" and hid Greece behind a metal blind</a>.<br>

<br>
II<br>
THE MENDING APPARATUS<br>
<br>
         By a vestibule, by a lift, by a tubular railway, by a platform, by a sliding door—by reversing all the steps of her departure did Vashti arrive at her son’s room, which exactly resembled her own. She might well declare that the visit was superfluous. The buttons, the knobs, the reading-desk with the Book, the temperature, the atmosphere, the illumination—all were exactly the same. And if Kuno himself, flesh of her flesh, stood close beside her at last, what profit was there in that? She was too well-bred to shake him by the hand.<br>
         Averting her eyes, she spoke as follows:<br>
         ""Here I am. I have had the most terrible journey and greatly retarded the development of my soul. It is not worth it, Kuno, it is not worth it. My time is too precious. The sunlight almost touched me, and I have met with the rudest people. I can only stop a few minutes. Say what you want to say, and then I must return.""<br>
         ""I have been threatened with Homelessness,"" said Kuno.<br>
         She looked at him now.<br>
         ""I have been threatened with Homelessness, and I could not tell you such a thing through the Machine.""<br>
         Homelessness means death. The victim is exposed to the air, which kills him.<br>
         ""I have been outside since I spoke to you last. The tremendous thing has happened, and they have discovered me.""<br>
         ""But why shouldn’t you go outside?"" she exclaimed, ""It is perfectly legal, perfectly mechanical, to visit the surface of the earth. I have lately been to a lecture on the sea; there is no objection to that; one simply summons a respirator and gets an Egression-permit. It is not the kind of thing that spiritually minded people do, and I begged you not to do it, but there is no legal objection to it.""<br>
         ""I did not get an Egression-permit.""<br>
         ""Then how did you get out?""<br>
         ""I found out a way of my own.""<br>
         The phrase conveyed no meaning to her, and he had to repeat it.<br>
         ""A way of your own?"" she whispered. ""But that would be wrong.""<br>
         ""Why?""<br>
         The question shocked her beyond measure.<br>
         ""You are beginning to worship the Machine,"" he said coldly.<br>
         ""You think it irreligious of me to have found out a way of my own. It was just what the Committee thought, when they threatened me with Homelessness.""<br>
         At this she grew angry. ""I worship nothing!"" she cried. ""I am most advanced. I don’t think you irreligious, for there is no such thing as religion left. All the fear and the superstition that existed once have been destroyed by the Machine. I only meant that to find out a way of your own was----Besides, there is no new way out.""<br>
         ""So it is always supposed.""<br>
         ""Except through the vomitories, for which one must have an Egression-permit, it is impossible to get out. The Book says so.""<br>
         ""Well, the Book’s wrong, for I have been out on my feet.""<br>
         For Kuno was possessed of a certain physical strength.<br>
         By these days it was a demerit to be muscular. Each infant was examined at birth, and all who promised undue strength were destroyed. Humanitarians may protest, but it would have been no true kindness to let an athlete live; he would never have been happy in that state of life to which the Machine had called him; he would have yearned for trees to climb, rivers to bathe in, meadows and hills against which he might measure his body. Man must be adapted to his surroundings, must he not? In the dawn of the world our weakly must be exposed on Mount Taygetus, in its twilight our strong will suffer euthanasia, that the Machine may progress, that the Machine may progress, that the Machine may progress eternally.<br>
         ""You know that we have lost the sense of space. We say <a href=""/24558778/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Space-is-annihilated-but-we-have-annihilated-not-space-but-the-sense-thereof-we-have-lost-a-part-of-ourselves"" data-id=""24558778"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">“space is annihilated”, but we have annihilated not space, but the sense thereof. We have lost a part of ourselves.</a> I determined to recover it, and I began by walking up and down the platform of the railway outside my room. Up and down, until I was tired, and so did recapture the meaning of “Near” and “Far”. “Near” is a place to which I can get quickly on my feet, not a place to which the train or the air-ship will take me quickly. “Far” is a place to which I cannot get quickly on my feet; the vomitory is “far”, though I could be there in thirty-eight seconds by summoning the train. Man is the measure. That was my first lesson. Man’s feet are the measure for distance, his hands are the measure for ownership, his body is the measure for all that is lovable and desirable and strong. Then I went further: it was then that I called to you for the first time, and you would not come.<br>
         ""This city, as you know, is built deep beneath the surface of the earth, with only the vomitories protruding. Having paced the platform outside my own room, I took the lift to the next platform and paced that also, and so with each in turn, until I came to the topmost, above which begins the earth. All the platforms were exactly alike, and all that I gained by visiting them was to develop my sense of space and my muscles. I think I should have been content with this—it is not a little thing,—but as I walked and brooded, it occurred to me that our cities had been built in the days when men still breathed the outer air, and that there had been ventilation shafts for the workmen. I could think of nothing but these ventilation shafts. Had they been destroyed by all the food-tubes and medicine-tubes and music- tubes that the Machine has evolved lately? Or did traces of them remain? One thing was certain. If I came upon them anywhere, it would be in the railway-tunnels of the topmost storey. Everywhere else, all space was accounted for.<br>
         ""<a href=""/5218463/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/I-am-telling-my-story-quickly-but-dont-think-that-i-was-not-a-coward-or-that-your-answers-never-depressed-me-it-is-not-the-proper-thing-it-is-not-mechanical-it-is-not-decent-to-walk-along-a-railway-tunnel-i-did-not-fear-that-i-might-tread-upon-a-live-rail-and-be-killed-i-feared-something-far-more-intangible-doing-what-was-not-contemplated-by-the-machine-then-i-said-to-myself-man-is-the-measure-and-i-went-and-after-many-visits-i-found-an-opening"" data-id=""5218463"" class=""has_comments"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">I am telling my story quickly, but don’t think that I was not a coward or that your answers never depressed me. It is not the proper thing, it is not mechanical, it is not decent to walk along a railway-tunnel. I did not fear that I might tread upon a live rail and be killed. I feared something far more intangible-doing what was not contemplated by the Machine. Then I said to myself, “Man is the measure”, and I went, and after many visits I found an opening.</a><br>
         ""The tunnels, of course, were lighted. Everything is light, artificial light; darkness is the exception. So when I saw a black gap in the tiles, I knew that it was an exception, and rejoiced. I put in my arm—I could put in no more at first—and waved it round and round in ecstasy. I loosened another tile, and put in my head, and shouted into the darkness: ‘I am coming, I shall do it yet,’ and my voice reverberated down endless passages. I seemed to hear the spirits of those dead workmen who had returned each evening to the starlight and to their wives, and all the generations who had lived in the open air called back to me, ‘You will do it yet, you are coming.’<br>
         He paused, and, absurd as he was, his last words moved her.<br>
         For Kuno had lately asked to be a father, and his request had been refused by the Committee. His was not a type that the Machine desired to hand on.<br>
         ""Then a train passed. It brushed by me, but I thrust my head and arms into the hole. I had done enough for one day, so I crawled back to the platform, went down in the lift, and summoned my bed. Ah what dreams! And again I called you, and again you refused.""<br>
         She shook her head and said:<br>
         ""Don’t. Don’t talk of these terrible things. You make me miserable. You are throwing civilization away.""<br>
         ""But I had got back the sense of space and a man cannot rest then. I determined to get in at the hole and climb the shaft. And so I exercised my arms. Day after day I went through ridiculous movements, until my flesh ached, and I could hang by my hands and hold the pillow of my bed outstretched for many minutes. Then I summoned a respirator, and started.<br>
         ""It was easy at first. The mortar had somehow rotted, and I soon pushed some more tiles in, and clambered after them into the darkness, and the spirits of the dead comforted me. I don’t know what I mean by that. I just say what I felt. I felt, for the first time, that a protest had been lodged against corruption, and that even as the dead were comforting me, so I was comforting the unborn. I felt that humanity existed, and that it existed without clothes. How can I possibly explain this? It was naked, humanity seemed naked, and all these tubes and buttons and machineries neither came into the world with us, nor will they follow us out, nor do they matter supremely while we are here. Had I been strong, I would have torn off every garment I had, and gone out into the outer air unswaddled. But this is not for me, nor perhaps for my generation. I climbed with my respirator and my hygienic clothes and my dietetic tabloids! Better thus than not at all.<br>
         ""There was a ladder, made of some primæval metal. The light from the railway fell upon its lowest rungs, and I saw that it led straight upwards out of the rubble at the bottom of the shaft. Perhaps our ancestors ran up and down it a dozen times daily, in their building. As I climbed, the rough edges cut through my gloves so that my hands bled. The light helped me for a little, and then came darkness and, worse still, silence which pierced my ears like a sword. The Machine hums! Did you know that? Its hum penetrates our blood, and may even guide our thoughts. Who knows! I was getting beyond its power. Then I thought: “This silence means that I am doing wrong.” But I heard voices in the silence, and again they strengthened me."" He laughed. ""I had need of them. The next moment I cracked my head against something.""<br>
         She sighed.<br>
         ""I had reached one of those pneumatic stoppers that defend us from the outer air. You may have noticed them on the air- ship. Pitch dark, my feet on the rungs of an invisible ladder, my hands cut; I cannot explain how I lived through this part, but the voices till comforted me, and I felt for fastenings. The stopper, I suppose, was about eight feet across. I passed my hand over it as far as I could reach. It was perfectly smooth. I felt it almost to the centre. Not quite to the centre, for my arm was too short. Then the voice said: “Jump. It is worth it. There may be a handle in the centre, and you may catch hold of it and so come to us your own way. And if there is no handle, so that you may fall and are dashed to pieces—it is still worth it: you will still come to us your own way.” So I jumped. There was a handle, and—""<br>
         He paused. Tears gathered in his mother’s eyes. She knew that he was fated. If he did not die today he would die tomorrow. There was not room for such a person in the world. And with her pity disgust mingled. She was ashamed at having borne such a son, she who had always been so respectable and so full of ideas. Was he really the little boy to whom she had taught the use of his stops and buttons, and to whom she had given his first lessons in the Book? The very hair that disfigured his lip showed that he was reverting to some savage type. On atavism the Machine can have no mercy.<br>
         ""There was a handle, and I did catch it. I hung tranced over the darkness and heard the hum of these workings as the last whisper in a dying dream. All the things I had cared about and all the people I had spoken to through tubes appeared infinitely little. Meanwhile the handle revolved. My weight had set something in motion and I span slowly, and then----<br>
         ""I cannot describe it. I was lying with my face to the sunshine. Blood poured from my nose and ears and I heard a tremendous roaring. The stopper, with me clinging to it, had simply been blown out of the earth, and the air that we make down here was escaping through the vent into the air above. It burst up like a fountain. I crawled back to it—for the upper air hurts—and, as it were, I took great sips from the edge. My respirator had flown goodness knows here, my clothes were torn. I just lay with my lips close to the hole, and I sipped until the bleeding stopped. You can imagine nothing so curious. This hollow in the grass—I will speak of it in a minute,—the sun shining into it, not brilliantly but through marbled clouds,—the peace, the nonchalance, the sense of space, and, brushing my cheek, the roaring fountain of our artificial air! Soon I spied my respirator, bobbing up and down in the current high above my head, and higher still were many air-ships. But no one ever looks out of air-ships, and in any case they could not have picked me up. There I was, stranded. The sun shone a little way down the shaft, and revealed the topmost rung of the ladder, but it was hopeless trying to reach it. I should either have been tossed up again by the escape, or else have fallen in, and died. I could only lie on the grass, sipping and sipping, and from time to time glancing around me.<br>
         ""I knew that I was in Wessex, for I had taken care to go to a lecture on the subject before starting. Wessex lies above the room in which we are talking now. It was once an important state. Its kings held all the southern coast form the Andredswald to Cornwall, while the Wansdyke protected them on the north, running over the high ground. The lecturer was only concerned with the rise of Wessex, so I do not know how long it remained an international power, nor would the knowledge have assisted me. To tell the truth I could do nothing but laugh, during this part. There was I, with a pneumatic stopper by my side and a respirator bobbing over my head, imprisoned, all three of us, in a grass-grown hollow that was edged with fern.""<br>
         Then he grew grave again.<br>
         ""Lucky for me that it was a hollow. For the air began to fall back into it and to fill it as water fills a bowl. I could crawl about. Presently I stood. I breathed a mixture, in which the air that hurts predominated whenever I tried to climb the sides. This was not so bad. I had not lost my tabloids and remained ridiculously cheerful, and as for the Machine, I forgot about it altogether. My one aim now was to get to the top, where the ferns were, and to view whatever objects lay beyond.<br>
         ""I rushed the slope. The new air was still too bitter for me and I came rolling back, after a momentary vision of something grey. The sun grew very feeble, and I remembered that he was in Scorpio—I had been to a lecture on that too. If the sun is in Scorpio, and you are in Wessex, it means that you must be as quick as you can, or it will get too dark. (This is the first bit of useful information I have ever got from a lecture, and I expect it will be the last.) It made me try frantically to breathe the new air, and to advance as far as I dared out of my pond. The hollow filled so slowly. At times I thought that the fountain played with less vigour. My respirator seemed to dance nearer the earth; the roar was decreasing.""<br>
         He broke off.<br>
         ""I don’t think this is interesting you. The rest will interest you even less. There are no ideas in it, and I wish that I had not troubled you to come. We are too different, mother.""<br>
         She told him to continue.<br>
         ""It was evening before I climbed the bank. The sun had very nearly slipped out of the sky by this time, and I could not get a good view. You, who have just crossed the Roof of the World, will not want to hear an account of the little hills that I saw—low colourless hills. But to me they were living and the turf that covered them was a skin, under which their muscles rippled, and I felt that those hills had called with incalculable force to men in the past, and that men had loved them. Now they sleep—perhaps for ever. They commune with humanity in dreams. Happy the man, happy the woman, who awakes the hills of Wessex. For though they sleep, they will never die.""<br>
         His voice rose passionately.<br>
         ""Cannot you see, cannot all you lecturers see, that it is we that are dying, and that down here the only thing that really lives in the Machine? We created the Machine, to do our will, but we cannot make it do our will now. It was robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch, it has blurred every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act, it has paralysed our bodies and our wills, and now it compels us to worship it. The Machine develops—but not on our lies. The Machine proceeds—but not to our goal. We only exist as the blood corpuscles that course through its arteries, and if it could work without us, it would let us die. Oh, I have no remedy—or, at least, only one—to tell men again and again that I have seen the hills of Wessex as Ælfrid saw them when he overthrew the Danes.<br>
         ""So the sun set. I forgot to mention that a belt of mist lay between my hill and other hills, and that it was the colour of pearl.""<br>
         He broke off for the second time.<br>
         ""Go on,"" said his mother wearily.<br>
         He shook his head.<br>
         ""Go on. Nothing that you say can distress me now. I am hardened.""<br>
         ""I had meant to tell you the rest, but I cannot: I know that I cannot: good-bye.""<br>
         Vashti stood irresolute. All her nerves were tingling with his blasphemies. But she was also inquisitive.<br>
         ""This is unfair,"" she complained. ""You have called me across the world to hear your story, and hear it I will. Tell me—as briefly as possible, for this is a disastrous waste of time—tell me how you returned to civilization.""<br>
         ""Oh—that!"" he said, starting. ""You would like to hear about civilization. Certainly. Had I got to where my respirator fell down?""<br>
         ""No—but I understand everything now. You put on your respirator, and managed to walk along the surface of the earth to a vomitory, and there your conduct was reported to the Central Committee.""<br>
         ""By no means.""<br>
         He passed his hand over his forehead, as if dispelling some strong impression. Then, resuming his narrative, he warmed to it again.<br>
         ""My respirator fell about sunset. I had mentioned that the fountain seemed feebler, had I not?""<br>
         ""Yes.""<br>
         ""About sunset, it let the respirator fall. As I said, I had entirely forgotten about the Machine, and I paid no great attention at the time, being occupied with other things. I had my pool of air, into which I could dip when the outer keenness became intolerable, and which would possibly remain for days, provided that no wind sprang up to disperse it. Not until it was too late did I realize what the stoppage of the escape implied. You see—the gap in the tunnel had been mended; the Mending Apparatus; the Mending Apparatus, was after me.<br>
         ""One other warning I had, but I neglected it. The sky at night was clearer than it had been in the day, and the moon, which was about half the sky behind the sun, shone into the dell at moments quite brightly. I was in my usual place—on the boundary between the two atmospheres—when I thought I saw something dark move across the bottom of the dell, and vanish into the shaft. In my folly, I ran down. I bent over and listened, and I thought I heard a faint scraping noise in the depths.<br>
         ""At this—but it was too late—I took alarm. I determined to put on my respirator and to walk right out of the dell. But my respirator had gone. I knew exactly where it had fallen—between the stopper and the aperture—and I could even feel the mark that it had made in the turf. It had gone, and I realized that something evil was at work, and I had better escape to the other air, and, if I must die, die running towards the cloud that had been the colour of a pearl. I never started. Out of the shaft—it is too horrible. A worm, a long white worm, had crawled out of the shaft and gliding over the moonlit grass.<br>
         ""I screamed. I did everything that I should not have done, I stamped upon the creature instead of flying from it, and it at once curled round the ankle. Then we fought. The worm let me run all over the dell, but edged up my leg as I ran. “Help!” I cried. (That part is too awful. It belongs to the part that you will never know.) “Help!” I cried. (Why cannot we suffer in silence?) “Help!” I cried. When my feet were wound together, I fell, I was dragged away from the dear ferns and the living hills, and past the great metal stopper (I can tell you this part), and I thought it might save me again if I caught hold of the handle. It also was enwrapped, it also. Oh, the whole dell was full of the things. They were searching it in all directions, they were denuding it, and the white snouts of others peeped out of the hole, ready if needed. Everything that could be moved they brought—brushwood, bundles of fern, everything, and down we all went intertwined into hell. The last things that I saw, ere the stopper closed after us, were certain stars, and I felt that a man of my sort lived in the sky. For I did fight, I fought till the very end, and it was only my head hitting against the ladder that quieted me. I woke up in this room. The worms had vanished. I was surrounded by artificial air, artificial light, artificial peace, and my friends were calling to me down speaking-tubes to know whether I had come across any new ideas lately.""<br>
         Here his story ended. Discussion of it was impossible, and Vashti turned to go.<br>
         ""It will end in Homelessness,"" she said quietly.<br>
         ""I wish it would,"" retorted Kuno.<br>
         ""The Machine has been most merciful.""<br>
         ""I prefer the mercy of God.""<br>
         ""By that superstitious phrase, do you mean that you could live in the outer air?""<br>
         ""Yes.""<br>
         ""Have you ever seen, round the vomitories, the bones of those who were extruded after the Great Rebellion?""<br>
         ""Yes.""<br>
         ""Have you ever seen, round the vomitories, the bones of those who were extruded after the Great Rebellion?""<br>
         ""Yes.""<br>
         ""They were left where they perished for our edification. A few crawled away, but they perished, too—who can doubt it? And so with the Homeless of our own day. The surface of the earth supports life no longer.""<br>
         ""Indeed.""<br>
         ""Ferns and a little grass may survive, but all higher forms have perished. Has any air-ship detected them?""<br>
         ""No.""<br>
         ""Has any lecturer dealt with them?""<br>
         ""No.""<br>
         ""Then why this obstinacy?""<br>
         ""Because I have seen them,"" he exploded.<br>
         ""Seen what?""<br>
         ""Because I have seen her in the twilight—because she came to my help when I called—because she, too, was entangled by the worms, and, luckier than I, was killed by one of them piercing her throat.""<br>
         He was mad. Vashti departed, nor, in the troubles that followed, did she ever see his face again.<br>
        <br>
<br>
III<br>
THE HOMELESS<br>
        <br>
During the years that followed Kuno’s escapade, two important developments took place in the Machine. On the surface they were revolutionary, but in either case men’s minds had been prepared beforehand, and they did but express tendencies that were latent already.<br>
         The first of these was the abolition of respirator.<br>
         Advanced thinkers, like Vashti, had always held it foolish to visit the surface of the earth. Air-ships might be necessary, but what was the good of going out for mere curiosity and crawling along for a mile or two in a terrestrial motor? The habit was vulgar and perhaps faintly improper: it was unproductive of ideas, and had no connection with the habits that really mattered. So respirators were abolished, and with them, of course, the terrestrial motors, and except for a few lecturers, who complained that they were debarred access to their subject- matter, the development was accepted quietly. Those who still wanted to know what the earth was like had after all only to listen to some gramophone, or to look into some cinematophote. And even the lecturers acquiesced when they found that a lecture on the sea was none the less stimulating when compiled out of other lectures that had already been delivered on the same subject. ""Beware of first- hand ideas!"" exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. ""First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by live and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element—direct observation. Do not learn anything about this subject of mine—the French Revolution. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought Urizen thought Gutch thought Ho-Yung thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought LafcadioHearn thought Carlyle thought Mirabeau said about the French Revolution. Through the medium of these ten great minds, the blood that was shed at Paris and the windows that were broken at Versailles will be clarified to an idea which you may employ most profitably in your daily lives. But be sure that the intermediates are many and varied, for in history one authority exists to counteract another. Urizen must counteract the scepticism of Ho-Yung and Enicharmon, I must myself counteract the impetuosity of Gutch. You who listen to me are in a better position to judge about the French Revolution than I am. Your descendants will be even in a better position than you, for they will learn what you think I think, and yet another intermediate will be added to the chain. And in time""—his voice rose—""there will come a generation that had got beyond facts, beyond impressions, a generation absolutely colourless, a generation<br>
        <br>
         seraphically free<br>
From taint of personality,<br>
        <br>
which will see the French Revolution not as it happened, nor as they would like it to have happened, but as it would have happened, had it taken place in the days of the Machine.""<br>
         Tremendous applause greeted this lecture, which did but voice a feeling already latent in the minds of men—a feeling that terrestrial facts must be ignored, and that the abolition of respirators was a positive gain. It was even suggested that air-ships should be abolished too. This was not done, because air-ships had somehow worked themselves into the Machine’s system. But year by year they were used less, and mentioned less by thoughtful men.<br>
         The second great development was the re-establishment of religion.<br>
         This, too, had been voiced in the celebrated lecture. No one could mistake the reverent tone in which the peroration had concluded, and it awakened a responsive echo in the heart of each. Those who had long worshipped silently, now began to talk. They described the strange feeling of peace that came over them when they handled the Book of the Machine, the pleasure that it was to repeat certain numerals out of it, however little meaning those numerals conveyed to the outward ear, the ecstasy of touching a button, however unimportant, or of ringing an electric bell, however superfluously.<br>
         ""The Machine,"" they exclaimed, ""feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is the Machine."" And before long this allocution was printed on the first page of the Book, and in subsequent editions the ritual swelled into a complicated system of praise and prayer. The word ""religion"" was sedulously avoided, and in theory the Machine was still the creation and the implement of man. but in practice all, save a few retrogrades, worshipped it as divine. Nor was it worshipped in unity. One believer would be chiefly impressed by the blue optic plates, through which he saw other believers; another by the mending apparatus, which sinful Kuno had compared to worms; another by the lifts, another by the Book. And each would pray to this or to that, and ask it to intercede for him with the Machine as a whole. Persecution—that also was present. It did not break out, for reasons that will be set forward shortly. But it was latent, and all who did not accept the minimum known as ""undenominational Mechanism"" lived in danger of Homelessness, which means death, as we know.<br>
         To attribute these two great developments to the Central Committee, is to take a very narrow view of civilization. The Central Committee announced the developments, it is true, but they were no more the cause of them than were the kings of the imperialistic period the cause of war. Rather did they yield to some invincible pressure, which came no one knew whither, and which, when gratified, was succeeded by some new pressure equally invincible. To such a state of affairs it is convenient to give the name of progress. No one confessed the Machine was out of hand. Year by year it was served with increased efficiency and decreased intelligence. The better a man knew his own duties upon it, the less he understood the duties of his neighbour, and in all the world there was not one who understood the monster as a whole. Those master brains had perished. They had left full directions, it is true, and their successors had each of them mastered a portion of those directions. But Humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean the progress of the Machine.<br>
         As for Vashti, her life went peacefully forward until the final disaster. She made her room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light. She lectured and attended lectures. She exchanged ideas with her innumerable friends and believed she was growing more spiritual. At times a friend was granted Euthanasia, and left his or her room for the homelessness that is beyond all human conception. Vashti did not much mind. After an unsuccessful lecture, she would sometimes ask for Euthanasia herself. But the death-rate was not permitted to exceed the birth-rate, and the Machine had hitherto refused it to her.<br>
         The troubles began quietly, long before she was conscious of them.<br>
         One day she was astonished at receiving a message from her son. They never communicated, having nothing in common, and she had only heard indirectly that he was still alive, and had been transferred from the northern hemisphere, where he had behaved so mischievously, to the southern—indeed, to a room not far from her own.<br>
         ""Does he want me to visit him?"" she thought. ""Never again, never. And I have not the time.""<br>
         No, it was madness of another kind.<br>
         He refused to visualize his face upon the blue plate, and speaking out of the darkness with solemnity said:<br>
         ""The Machine stops.""<br>
         ""What do you say?""<br>
         ""The Machine is stopping, I know it, I know the signs.""<br>
         She burst into a peal of laughter. He heard her and was angry, and they spoke no more.<br>
         <a href=""/25458334/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Can-you-imagine-anything-more-absurd-she-cried-to-a-friend-a-man-who-was-my-son-believes-that-the-machine-is-stopping-it-would-be-impious-if-it-was-not-mad"" data-id=""25458334"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">""Can you imagine anything more absurd?"" she cried to a friend. ""A man who was my son believes that the Machine is stopping. It would be impious if it was not mad.""</a><br>
         ""The Machine is stopping?"" her friend replied. ""What does that mean? The phrase conveys nothing to me.""<br>
         ""Nor to me.""<br>
         ""He does not refer, I suppose, to the trouble there has been lately with the music?""<br>
         ""Oh no, of course not. Let us talk about music.""<br>
         ""Have you complained to the authorities?""<br>
         ""Yes, and they say it wants mending, and referred me to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus. I complained of those curious gasping sighs that disfigure the symphonies of the Brisbane school. They sound like some one in pain. The Committee of the Mending Apparatus say that it shall be remedied shortly.""<br>
         Obscurely worried, she resumed her life. For one thing, the defect in the music irritated her. For another thing, she could not forget Kuno’s speech. If he had known that the music was out of repair—he could not know it, for he detested music—if he had known that it was wrong, ""the Machine stops"" was exactly the venomous sort of remark he would have made. Of course he had made it at a venture, but the coincidence annoyed her, and she spoke with some petulance to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus.<br>
         They replied, as before, that the defect would be set right shortly.<br>
         ""Shortly! At once!"" she retorted. ""Why should I be worried by imperfect music? Things are always put right at once. If you do not mend it at once, I shall complain to the Central Committee.""<br>
         ""No personal complaints are received by the Central Committee,"" the Committee of the Mending Apparatus replied.<br>
         ""Through whom am I to make my complaint, then?""<br>
         ""Through us.""<br>
         ""I complain then.""<br>
         ""Your complaint shall be forwarded in its turn.""<br>
         ""Have others complained?""<br>
         This question was unmechanical, and the Committee of the Mending Apparatus refused to answer it.<br>
         ""It is too bad!"" she exclaimed to another of her friends.<br>
         ""There never was such an unfortunate woman as myself. I can never be sure of my music now. It gets worse and worse each time I summon it.""<br>
         ""What is it?""<br>
         ""I do not know whether it is inside my head, or inside the wall.""<br>
         ""Complain, in either case.""<br>
         ""I have complained, and my complaint will be forwarded in its turn to the Central Committee.""<br>
         Time passed, and they resented the defects no longer. The defects had not been remedied, but the human tissues in that latter day had become so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine. The sigh at the crises of the Brisbane symphony no longer irritated Vashti; she accepted it as part of the melody. The jarring noise, whether in the head or in the wall, was no longer resented by her friend. And so with the mouldy artificial fruit, so with the bath water that began to stink, so with the defective rhymes that the poetry machine had taken to emit. all were bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse unchallenged.<br>
         It was otherwise with the failure of the sleeping apparatus. That was a more serious stoppage. There came a day when over the whole world—in Sumatra, in Wessex, in the innumerable cities of Courland and Brazil—the beds, when summoned by their tired owners, failed to appear. It may seem a ludicrous matter, but from it we may date the collapse of humanity. The Committee responsible for the failure was assailed by complainants, whom it referred, as usual, to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus, who in its turn assured them that their complaints would be forwarded to the Central Committee. But the discontent grew, for mankind was not yet sufficiently adaptable to do without sleeping.<br>
         ""Some one of meddling with the Machine---"" they began.<br>
         ""Some one is trying to make himself king, to reintroduce the personal element.""<br>
         ""Punish that man with Homelessness.""<br>
         ""To the rescue! Avenge the Machine! Avenge the Machine!""<br>
         ""War! Kill the man!""<br>
         But the Committee of the Mending Apparatus now came forward, and allayed the panic with well-chosen words. It confessed that the Mending Apparatus was itself in need of repair.<br>
         The effect of this frank confession was admirable.<br>
         ""Of course,"" said a famous lecturer—he of the French Revolution, who gilded each new decay with splendour—""of course we shall not press our complaints now. The Mending Apparatus has treated us so well in the past that we all sympathize with it, and will wait patiently for its recovery. In its own good time it will resume its duties. Meanwhile let us do without our beds, our tabloids, our other little wants. Such, I feel sure, would be the wish of the Machine.""<br>
         Thousands of miles away his audience applauded. The Machine still linked them. Under the seas, beneath the roots of the mountains, ran the wires through which they saw and heard, the enormous eyes and ears that were their heritage, and the hum of many workings clothed their thoughts in one garment of subserviency. Only the old and the sick remained ungrateful, for it was rumoured that Euthanasia, too, was out of order, and that pain had reappeared among men.<br>
         It became difficult to read. A blight entered the atmosphere and dulled its luminosity. At times Vashti could scarcely see across her room. The air, too, was foul. Loud were the complaints, impotent the remedies, heroic the tone of the lecturer as he cried: ""Courage! courage! What matter so long as the Machine goes on ? To it the darkness and the light are one."" And though things improved again after a time, the old brilliancy was never recaptured, and humanity never recovered from its entrance into twilight. There was an hysterical talk of ""measures,"" of ""provisional dictatorship,"" and the inhabitants of Sumatra were asked to familiarize themselves with the workings of the central power station, the said power station being situated in France. But for the most part panic reigned, and men spent their strength praying to their Books, tangible proofs of the Machine’s omnipotence. There were gradations of terror- at times came rumours of hope-the Mending Apparatus was almost mended-the enemies of the Machine had been got under- new ""nerve-centres"" were evolving which would do the work even more magnificently than before. But there came a day when, without the slightest warning, without any previous hint of feebleness, the entire communication-system broke down, all over the world, and the world, as they understood it, ended.<br>
         Vashti was lecturing at the time and her earlier remarks had been punctuated with applause. As she proceeded the audience became silent, and at the conclusion there was no sound. Somewhat displeased, she called to a friend who was a specialist in sympathy. No sound: doubtless the friend was sleeping. And so with the next friend whom she tried to summon, and so with the next, until she remembered Kuno’s cryptic remark, ""The Machine stops"".<br>
         The phrase still conveyed nothing. If Eternity was stopping it would of course be set going shortly.<br>
         For example, there was still a little light and air—the atmosphere had improved a few hours previously. There was still the Book, and while there was the Book there was security.<br>
         Then she broke down, for with the cessation of activity came an unexpected terror—silence.<br>
         She had never known silence, and the coming of it nearly killed her—it did kill many thousands of people outright. Ever since her birth she had been surrounded by the steady hum. It was to the ear what artificial air was to the lungs, and agonizing pains shot across her head. And scarcely knowing what she did, she stumbled forward and pressed the unfamiliar button, the one that opened the door of her cell.<br>
         Now the door of the cell worked on a simple hinge of its own. It was not connected with the central power station, dying far away in France. It opened, rousing immoderate hopes in Vashti, for she thought that the Machine had been mended. It opened, and she saw the dim tunnel that curved far away towards freedom. One look, and then she shrank back. For the tunnel was full of people—she was almost the last in that city to have taken alarm.<br>
         People at any time repelled her, and these were nightmares from her worst dreams. People were crawling about, people were screaming, whimpering, gasping for breath, touching each other, vanishing in the dark, and ever and anon being pushed off the platform on to the live rail. Some were fighting round the electric bells, trying to summon trains which could not be summoned. Others were yelling for Euthanasia or for respirators, or blaspheming the Machine. Others stood at the doors of their cells fearing, like herself, either to stop in them or to leave them. And behind all the uproar was silence—the silence which is the voice of the earth and of the generations who have gone.<br>
         No—it was worse than solitude. She closed the door again and sat down to wait for the end. The disintegration went on, accompanied by horrible cracks and rumbling. The valves that restrained the Medical Apparatus must have weakened, for it ruptured and hung hideously from the ceiling. The floor heaved and fell and flung her from the chair. A tube oozed towards her serpent fashion. And at last the final horror approached—light began to ebb, and she knew that civilization’s long day was closing.<br>
         She whirled around, praying to be saved from this, at any rate, kissing the Book, pressing button after button. The uproar outside was increasing, and even penetrated the wall. Slowly the brilliancy of her cell was dimmed, the reflections faded from the metal switches. Now she could not see the reading-stand, now not the Book, though she held it in her hand. Light followed the flight of sound, air was following light, and the original void returned to the cavern from which it has so long been excluded. Vashti continued to whirl, like the devotees of an earlier religion, screaming, praying, striking at the buttons with bleeding hands.<br>
         It was thus that she opened her prison and escaped—escaped in the spirit: at least so it seems to me, ere my meditation closes. That she escapes in the body—I cannot perceive that. She struck, by chance, the switch that released the door, and the rush of foul air on her skin, the loud throbbing whispers in her ears, told her that she was facing the tunnel again, and that tremendous platform on which she had seen men fighting. They were not fighting now. Only the whispers remained, and the little whimpering groans. They were dying by hundreds out in the dark.<br>
         She burst into tears.<br>
         Tears answered her.<br>
         They wept for humanity, those two, not for themselves. They could not bear that this should be the end. Ere silence was completed their hearts were opened, and they knew what had been important on the earth. Man, the flower of all flesh, the noblest of all creatures visible, man who had once made god in his image, and had mirrored his strength on the constellations, beautiful naked man was dying, strangled in the garments that he had woven. Century after century had he toiled, and here was his reward. Truly the garment had seemed heavenly at first, shot with colours of culture, sewn with the threads of self-denial. And heavenly it had been so long as man could shed it at will and live by the essence that is his soul, and the essence, equally divine, that is his body. The sin against the body—it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend—glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.<br>
         ""Where are you?"" she sobbed.<br>
         His voice in the darkness said, ""Here.""<br>
         Is there any hope, Kuno?""<br>
         ""None for us.""<br>
         ""Where are you?""<br>
         She crawled over the bodies of the dead. His blood spurted over her hands.<br>
         ""Quicker,"" he gasped, ""I am dying—but we touch, we talk, not through the Machine.""<br>
         He kissed her.<br>
         ""We have come back to our own. We die, but we have recaptured life, as it was in Wessex, when Ælfrid overthrew the Danes. We know what they know outside, they who dwelt in the cloud that is the colour of a pearl.""<br>
         ""But Kuno, is it true ? Are there still men on the surface of the earth ? Is this—tunnel, this poisoned darkness—really not the end?""<br>
         He replied:<br>
         ""I have seen them, spoken to them, loved them. They are hiding in the midst and the ferns until our civilization stops. Today they are the Homeless—tomorrow—""<br>
         ""Oh, tomorrow—some fool will start the Machine again, tomorrow.""<br>
         ""Never,"" said Kuno, ""never. <a href=""/5234372/Em-forster-the-machine-stops/Humanity-has-learnt-its-lesson"" data-id=""5234372"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Humanity has learnt its lesson</a>.""<br>
         As he spoke, the whole city was broken like a honeycomb. An air-ship had sailed in through the vomitory into a ruined wharf. It crashed downwards, exploding as it went, rending gallery after gallery with its wings of steel. For a moment they saw the nations of the dead, and, before they joined them, scraps of the untainted sky.</p>

You're gonna leave me all alone? On Christmas?<br>
Baby, what'd I ever do to deserve all that?<br>
Can't we just, like, snuggle underneath the tree? By the fireplace?<br>
You know I make those cookies you like<br>

Well, maybe this Christmastime<br>

[Intro]<br>
Dame tiempo<br>
Que no estoy en mi mejor momento<br>
Pero yo mejoro de a poquitos, sí<br>
Hoy estoy down, pero yo sé que mañana será más bonito<br>
Diferente, otra vibra, otro ambiente<br>
Hoy estoy en menos veinte<br>
Pero me recargo de mi gente<br>

Y mientras me curo del corazón<br>

Everything that lives is gone to waste</p>

Once I turn it on, I never stop, stop (Never stop)<br>
Be careful, I don't talk, I shoot (I shoot)<br>
If you still don't know, let me make it clear, clear (Clear)<br>
Playing with me always comes at a cost<br>
Soft reggaetón, bitten lips<br>
Diamonds trailing down my belly button<br>
More than one is already lost<br>
A doll from a Tarantino movie (Give it to me, papi)<br>
Go easy, you've been warned (Oh-oh)<br>
It's very likely you'll get addicted to me (Oh-oh)<br>

Quietly so that no one knows (Ah)<br>

""I got dreams and I got love<br>
I got my feet on the ground and family above<br>
Can you send some happiness with my best<br>
To the rest of the people of the East and the West<br>
And maybe every once in a while<br>
You give my grandma a reason to smile<br>
'Tis the season to smile<br>
It's cold, but we'll be freezing in style<br>
And let me meet a girl one day<br>
That wants to spread some love this way<br>
We can let our souls run free<br>
And she can open some happiness with me""<br>

There'll be parties for hosting<br>

And caroling out in the snow<br>
There'll be scary ghost stories<br>
And tales of the glories<br>
Of Christmases long, long ago<br>

It's the most wonderful time of the year<br>
There'll be much mistletoeing<br>
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near<br>

<br>
[Verso 1: Future]<br>
Costumava querer foder uma vadia do R&amp;B, então essa merda aconteceu, yeah<br>
Costumava querer ser rico, então finalmente aconteceu, pensei que isso me faria feliz (Pensei que isso me faria feliz)<br>
Eu poderia ter aguentado a dor e ter saído triste<br>
As ruas ficaram por perto e me criaram, mas eu não tenho pai<br>
Esses caras tentam me clonar, fugir com meu еstilo<br>
Por vender Coco, tenho Chanеl na minha jaqueta (Jaqueta)<br>
Essa mina me chupa gostoso sem esforço, não dura (Dura)<br>
Tô tomando mais drogas, tô sozinho numa mansão (Sozinho)<br>
Tô andando por aí, mexendo com drogas na minha mãos (Mexendo)<br>
Só mais uma vadia falida, apenas pregando por essa grana (Só mais uma vadia)<br>
E eu sei que devo receber um adiantamento de um bilhão de dólares (Uh-huh)<br>
<br>
[Refrão 1: Travis Scott &amp; <i>Future</i>]<br>
Eu pude ver o futuro, eu pude ver o futuro (Eu posso ver o futuro)<br>
Eu posso ver o futuro, parece que nivelamos o céu (Céu)<br>
Mal posso esperar pra viver na glória, na vida eterna e duradoura (<i>Viver na glória</i>)<br>
Você não quer assumir o volante? Eu me reclino e fico parado<br>
Pode muito bem aparecer agora, Ele vai aparecer sem avisar<br>
Sobre as trombetas, você gosta do jeito que soa? (<i>O jeito como soa</i>)<br>
<br>
[Pós-Refrão: Travis Scott]<br>
Você conhece o futuro do salto, ayy<br>
Eu posso ouvir seus pensamentos tão alto, eu posso ouvir a multidão tão alto<br>
Você gosta do jeito que soa? Ayy<br>
Eu posso ouvir seus pensamentos tão alto, eu posso ouvir a multidão tão alto, tão alto<br>
<br>
[Ponte: Travis Scott &amp; <i>Future</i>]<br>
Eu posso ver o futuro, tô andando com a tempestade e alguns soldados<br>
Tô andando por essa merda, essa merda é estúpida<br>
Andando por aí no céu como se eu fosse o Luke-uh<br>
Tô me esquivando de todos esses assuntos como se eu fosse Bruce-uh, super<br>
Andando com meus anjos, nos esquivando de Lúcifer (<i>Ande</i>)<br>
Vendo todos os ângulos, eu consigo ver através de você, yeah (<i>Yeah</i>)<br>
<br>

Você não quer assumir o volante? (<i>Até mais</i>) Eu me reclino e fico parado<br>
Pode muito bem aparecer agora, Ele vai aparecer sem avisar<br>
Sobre as trombetas, você gosta do jeito que soa?<br>
Você conhece o futuro do salto<br>

[Refrão 2: Future]<br>
Conto tanto dinheiro até a minha pele descascar<br>
Benz vermelho-cereja como um verdadeiro cafetão (Yeah)<br>
Meu irmão prepara as drogas, é preciso muita habilidade<br>
Divido a minha mina com a minha vadia, eu não ligo (Não)<br>
Ou você tá ganhando dinheiro ou tá fofocando (Yeah)<br>
Ela escolheu, colocou esse casaco, agora ela mente pra mim<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Future]<br>
Lugares que eu nunca pensei que iria, eu encontrei modelos em<br>
Eu ouço os demônios com clareza quando eles chamam (Yeah)<br>
Voos na Terra, então eu tive que me nomear com o nome de um planeta (Pluto)<br>
Morte automática quando você vai contra a minha família<br>
Poucos términos se tornaram públicos, eu acabei de comprar outra gostosa (Comprei outra gostosa)<br>
Essa vadia sabia que eu era tóxico quando me conheceu, eu era um selvagem (Eu era um selvagem)<br>
No alto das colinas, tô tentando evitar qualquer loucura (Yeah)<br>
Particular no Lear, é exatamente como imaginamos<br>
Só tô vendendo esse Hi-Tech porque não tenho o Actavis (Yeah)<br>
Eu tô tentando ser modesto (Modesto), parece que tô me gabando (Me gabando)<br>
Cartier nos meus óculos (Óculos), tudo por causa da minha fama (Fama)<br>
Essa vadia disse que tem vergonha de me amar em público, (Público) prefere ficar no privado (Vi o suficiente)<br>

[Verso 3: SZA &amp; <i>Travis Scott</i>]<br>
Eu não me canso, te falei que eu simplesmente quero tudo<br>
Eu não me canso, você não tem feito o suficiente (<i>Você gosta do jeito que soa?</i>)<br>
Tão frio, tão frio, é tão frio, tão frio, tão frio<br>
Você pode ver o futuro, existe um brilho nos seus olhos<br>
Por que você está na minha coxa? Não te posso deixar<br>
Esses caras planejam a minha morte, eu tenho assassinato na minha mente<br>
Eu tenho dinheiro na linha, não posso perder mesmo se eu tentasse<br>
Não deixo nenhuma vadia atrapalhar meu passo<br>
Escolhida, eu vou apostar em mim<br>
Escolhida, todas as minhas coisas e dentes<br>
Vadias e eu não aguento nenhum calor<br>
Diamantes dançando em mim<br>
Você está começando do zero, cara, você está fora de si<br>
Você transou com aquela garota que conheceu na festa<br>
Eu tenho alguns caras novos no saguão<br>
Como eu posso dormir quando você está caçando corpos?<br>
Eu ainda quero estar com você, confie em mim, eu sei que isso é loucura<br>
Eu prefiro transar com você do que transar com fracotes<br>
Eu fiz uma merda em Berlim, meu moldae<br>
Nós dois não somos nada e isso está funcionando pra mim<br>
Funcionando pra mim, yeah<br>
Eu pude ver o futuro, eu pude ver o futuro</p>

I made a name, it's global (It's global), my enemy pass over (Hey)<br>
I took the way to the top (Top), I had to learn to be smart (Smart)<br>
I had to move with my heart, keepin' my eyes on the part<br>
'Cause it get evil and dark (Evil and dark)<br>
When it come to my opponents<br>
I know how to beat 'em, I know to defeat 'em (Hey)<br>
Livin' my life by the moment<br>
Somebody callin', somebody gon' need 'em<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Swae Lee]<br>
I just came to my senses (Yeah)<br>
I stay in another dimension<br>
Fear is non-existent (Existent)<br>
Suit up and swing through the city (Ooh, hey)<br>
Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (Afraid)<br>
I'm in my own world, give me space<br>
I'm in my own universe, give me space (Space, yeah)<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Swae Lee]<br>
Okay, we bounce and shake, we roll and rock<br>
I got to set it straight, the block is hot<br>
Something's come over me, I hit unlock<br>
And tell my enemies, ""I'll never stop""<br>
No, no, nothing can shake me now<br>
Tell the block I made it now<br>
Yeah, the whole town is talking out<br>
I swear, nothing can stop me now<br>
All this, boosting all my senses<br>
I won't start, but I finished<br>
I shoot my shot, bet I won't miss it<br>
Only way to go is go the distance<br>
Nothing can shake me now<br>
Nothing can break me down<br>
Tell the whole town, we popping now<br>
Nothing can shake me now<br>

Pero pusieron la canción, eh, eh, eh<br>
Que cantamo’ bien borracho'<br>

[Verso 1: J Balvin]<br>
Justo cuando creía<br>
Que por comerme a do’ o diez, te olvidaría' (Yeh)<br>
Cogí un respiro y me salí de la vía<br>
Y como un pendejo, no sabía lo que hacía<br>
Nunca lo superé, nunca te superé (No; no)<br>
Hasta me aprendí to'a la' balada’ en inglé' (Yeh)<br>
Respiré y conté hasta tres (Uno, dos, tres)<br>

¿A que guió solo?<br>

[Estribillo: J Balvin &amp; <i>Bad Bunny</i>]<br>

<br>
[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]<br>
Y hace tiempo que no venía' a mi cabeza<br>
Pero ya van par de cerveza'<br>
Y me acordé de cómo tú me besa'<br>
De to' lo' polvo' encima 'e la mesa<br>
Y en el carro, la playa, y el motel<br>
En casa de tu pai', cuando yo te iba a ver<br>
Las vece' que tu mai' no' llegó a coger<br>
Tú brincando mojaíta', sudando Chanel<br>
Yo sé que lo nuestro e' cosa de ayer<br>
Y me pone contento que te va bien con él<br>
Yo ni te extrañaba ni te quería ver<br>
Pero pusieron la canción que te gustaba poner<br>
Y me acordé de ti, cuando me hiciste feliz<br>
Se acabó, pues, me fui, ey<br>
Yo mismo me río de mí porque—<br>

Pa' curarme las heridas, Catarina con saliva, así no siento nada<br>

No sé qué estarás pensando, si me estarás extrañando<br>
Ni de mí te has de acordar<br>

Pero ni así se mе da<br>
La gente me ha preguntado sobre ti, que qué ha pasado<br>
Y no les quiero contestar<br>

Made a buck off my soul<br>
I've been singing stories to the crowd<br>

"<p>Woman: From the campus of the Wharton School in San Francisco, this is Startup School Radio. Here is Y Combinator partner Aaron Harris.<br>
Aaron: Good morning and welcome to Startup School Radio, live from the Wharton School in San Francisco, on Sirius XM's Business Radio, powered by the Wharton School. I'm your host, Aaron Harris. I'm a partner at Y Combinator, where we fund early stage companies and work with them to help make them into billion dollar businesses. Every year, Y Combinator does a startup conference called Startup School, where we bring great founders that we really love and have them tell their stories, everything they've learned, from the screw-ups to the successes and everything in between. Here on Startup School Radio, we'll be bringing those founders to you on a weekly basis. We broadcast every Wednesday at 1 PM Eastern, 10 AM Pacific with the goal of helping anyone who's thinking about starting a company learn how to do it better.<br>
Coming up on today's show, PlanGrid's founders Ryan Sutton-Gee, Tracy Young, and Ralph Gootee talk with me about their story and how they created an incredible app that lets construction companies store blueprints and documents on their computers and on their mobile devices. Plus, later, we'll hear from recent grads of our winter 2015 batch, Liz Wessel and J.J. Fliegelman, co-founders of Campus Job. We'll talk with them about their YC experience, what they've learned and how they're putting it into action now they're out in the real world.<br>
If you're thinking about starting a company, or you're an entrepreneur in the early stages of running a startup and have a question for us, we'd love to hear from you. Our number is 844-Wharton, that's 844-942-7866 and be sure to follow our channel on Twitter, @bizradio111, or follow me on Twitter, @Harris. So, let's get going. I'm very happy to welcome my first guests, Tracy Young, Ryan Sutton-Gee and Ralph Gootee from PlanGrid. Thanks so much for joining us, everyone.<br>
Tracy: Thanks for having us. It's great to be here.<br>
Aaron: So, you're all part of YC's winter batch in 2012. So, you've been out for three years now. That's kind of a while.<br>
Tracy: Yeah, it's really strange how time goes by in a startup world.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. When did you found the company initially?<br>
Ryan: It's kind of funny. We actually sort of founded the company twice, in a weird sort of way, so originally . . .<br>
Aaron: You'll have to explain that one.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, we had the original idea, we actually it was just the three of us. There's actually four founders, Kenny Stone, who can't make it isn't here. We originally founded the company not knowing about Y Combinator and incorporating in California and kind of had a false start and we did a lot of great work but didn't really get our legal structure in place until later in the year, when we heard about Y Combinator and then we got together with the original four founders and applied then.<br>
But the basic story of how PlanGrid came about was really because myself and Tracy, we were both construction field workers, construction project engineers and Tracy came to me one day with this huge invoice for--<br>
Aaron: What? Sorry. I realize I don't even know, what actually is a Construction Project Engineer?<br>
Tracy: Yeah, so we're engineers on a job site with hard hats and muddy boots, safety vests, safety glasses and we're basically responsible for delivering the building on time and literally translating what's on the blueprints onto the actual structure in the field.<br>
Aaron: So, are you guiding the workers on the site, or you're actually hopping in the back hoe loaders and the cranes and operating them yourselves?<br>
Tracy: Right. So, we're not physically building the building with our bare hands, but we manage the day to day workflow of the job site, making sure that materials are delivered on time, making sure that everyone's safe.<br>
Aaron: So, basically pretty close to my dream job when I was a small child. Get to like hang out on construction sites with big equipment and see the whole thing go together.<br>
Tracy: Something like that.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, pretty much. Basically, a Construction Project Engineer is someone with typically a civil engineering or construction managing degree that gets to help direct, yeah, the big equipment and gets to see something go from dirt to building.<br>
Aaron: Got it. So, you were both working as Construction Project Engineers. How the hell do you go from there to starting a startup? That seems pretty far from the standard construction business.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. I mean, basically what happened is that, one thing is that, as an individual, I went to Sac State with Tracy and studied Construction Management. Then I went to Stanford, when I did my masters in civil engineering there. And we have a lot of friends that are sort of in tech and doing startups and so I always knew I wanted to start a company of some kind, and then once--<br>
Aaron: Did you initially think it was going to be a construction firm or an engineering firm?<br>
Ryan: You know, it was kind of not, I hadn't really decided. It sort of, probably in my original plan was basically to do a construction firm, right, start a construction company, but if you're a young, tech savvy person like me and Tracy are and you work in construction industry and you're in the field, it doesn't take very long for you to notice that there's a lot of efficiencies that could be made, especially with technology. So, I remember like the iPad came out, when it was first released, and I got one for Christmas present, I think or a birthday present, I don't remember, and then the first thing I did was I brought it to work and I was like, ""Hey guys, check this out. Maybe I can put plans on here."" And it was just literally impossible to do so, and yet at the same time--<br>
Aaron: We're talking blueprints?<br>
Ryan: Yeah, yeah.<br>
Aaron: These massive . . . How big is the average blueprint? How many feet by . . .<br>
Tracy: It's a 42 inches by 30 inches.<br>
Aaron: And that's a standard size for blueprints?<br>
Tracy: Yeah.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. That doesn't fit. I mean the blueprint, I mean, the iPad screen is what, 10 inch diagonal or something like that, so . . .<br>
Ryan: Yeah. Well, what's even funnier is the standard for blueprints, for whatever reason, is PDFs, right? Those are meant to be printed, which is like not--<br>
Ralph: And you need special printers for this.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, and it's a terrible file format. So when you load it on to PDF reader on the iPad, it would crash the OS, actually, it was so bad. But, at the same time, you open up Google Maps and you can stream the planet off the internet on that thing. So, I knew it was possible to do that and when I brought it to Tracy, we had dinner one day and, by the way, I'm always pitching silly startup ideas to her, and her job was basically--<br>
Tracy: Ryan actually convinced me to start a company with him when I was 18, and--<br>
Aaron: So you guys have known each other for a long time?<br>
Tracy: Yeah, my freshman year of college and he had pitched me, you know, hundreds of ideas over, like, six years and blueprints on iPad was the one that I agreed to. I said--<br>
Aaron: What did you turn down before that?<br>
Tracy: Oh, my gosh! I don't know. They were all crazy, they were all crazy. Do you remember?<br>
Ryan: Well, there were some construction firm ideas, which I could talk for an hour as to why it's a really bad idea to found a construction firm. And so I try to find niches within that sort of field that wouldn't make us be personally bankrupt. But luckily, we have Tracy because the first one she said yes to turned out to work out pretty well, so it all worked out. But, yeah, if I remember right, like, I told her this idea. Usually, she'd shoot me down, like that's impractical for this reason or whatever, but instead she, literally that week I think, it was that week that you had to pay that giant invoice for the blueprints.<br>
Tracy: Yeah, yeah. So, I had accidentally ordered blueprints for folks that weren't exactly on my team, but I was being the nice guy and I got a bill for $27,000.<br>
Aaron: Whoa!<br>
Tracy: And I'm a new working engineer and I had no idea how I was going to pay for this. So, I told Ryan and, Ryan, do you remember what you said to me?<br>
Ryan: Yeah, I was like . . .<br>
Tracy: I remember this really well.<br>
Ryan: Holy shit! How can plans cost that much money? I had no idea.<br>
Aaron: How many plans was that?<br>
Tracy: It was only like 15 sets of plans in color.<br>
Aaron: Wow.<br>
Tracy: They're very, very expensive.<br>
Aaron: $27,000? And that's because, I mean, it's a special printer, it's special ink, it's special paper and I'm guessing it's kind of a monopoly business?<br>
Tracy: Mm-hmm.<br>
Aaron: Wow!<br>
Ryan: Yeah, to a certain extent it is. Also, it's just an enormous amount of paper. She was on this Kaiser Hospital. It was Kaiser San Leandro at the time and there's just so much paper. It's like 15,000 sheets to describe one hospital. It's not even a big hospital. It's a good size hospital, but it's just an enormous amount of paper.<br>
Aaron: Just to give me a sense, because I think of hospitals, I don't know how big that hospital is. For a house, 2,000 square foot house or something, how many pages of blueprints or pages of paper are we talking about?<br>
Tracy: [inaudible 00:08:32] have like 40 sheets of blueprints but then, if you change any walls, you change any doors, that's like an extra 10 sheets at a time.<br>
Aaron: And so the way this worked traditionally is basic then, the architect or the engineer would have to go in, change it, there's software to make these things and then reprint everything.<br>
Tracy: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: Wow! Okay. That sounds super inefficient.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. And then, to make it even crazier, just imagine, you know, you've got a hospital takes over a large part of, it's a large area. You've got, easily, 100 people working on it simultaneously. They can't come back to the trailer every time they need to look at plans. So, they've got separate copies of these paper sets and so, every time there's a change, it's not just, you have to print it out. You have to print it out and track those guys down, find their set, take it away from them, like screw in the new version.<br>
Aaron: So, Ryan, you see this huge inefficiency happening and you're like, ""Oh, I got this iPad thing. What if we could stick the blueprints inside the iPad. Was that basically the way, Tracy is that what he came to you with?<br>
Tracy: Yeah, yeah. He, in so many words, he says, ""It's 2010. It should be in the cloud and we should be able to view it on our mobile device.""<br>
Aaron: And you said?<br>
Tracy: And I said, ""Yeah, let's do it."" And so, we go to our good friend Antoine Hersen at the time, and he also went to Sacramento State, studying his masters in computer science and we said, ""Hey, you wanna join our startup?"" And he says, ""That's a great idea. You guys should learn how to program.""<br>
Aaron: Good advice.<br>
Tracy: We actually didn't learn how to program. We instead met like every week for, we met every week to work on the business plan and the wireframes of what was called Peanuts at that time.<br>
Aaron: Was that copyright infringement on the cartoon strip?<br>
Ryan: No. It's just, we were working for nothing, so we had [inaudible 00:10:18] in the document. Yeah.<br>
Aaron: I like it.<br>
Ryan: Yeah.<br>
Tracy: And then, at that time, I was dating this man named Ralph Gootee, and we were having dinner and our relationship was at a point where we're going steady, and we're sharing Google calendars together, and do you remember what you said to me, Ralph?<br>
Ralph: Why is there re-occurring event every Thursday with you and Ryan called Peanuts?<br>
Tracy: Four hours every Thursday night.<br>
Ralph: All kinds of conspiracy theories running through your head.<br>
Tracy: And so, I told him about Peanuts and what it was and his reaction, do you remember what you said to me?<br>
Ralph: At the time, I was a rendering engineer at Pixar, aspiring to be an iOS developer and I said, ""Do you know who I am? Do you know what I do as a job? Do you know I write iPad apps? Why have you not told me about this?""<br>
Tracy: And I said, ""Hey, you wanna join?""<br>
Ralph: Yeah. She said, ""Do you want to join for 30% of the company?"" So, she shafted me 3%, right from the get go.<br>
Aaron: That is harsh.<br>
Ralph: I should have known she would--<br>
Aaron: And your relationship survived that moment?<br>
Ralph: Absolutely.<br>
Tracy: But Ralph said yes and he said, ""Actually, can I be CTO?"" And everyone was like, yeah.<br>
Aaron: That makes sense.<br>
Tracy: And when Ryan found out that I shafted Ralph 3.33%, he quickly fixed that.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. So, originally, it was the three of us, a third, a third, a third, as I kind of mentioned in the beginning, and then, you know, later Antoine more formally joined us, rather than just yelling at us for not knowing how to program, which, you know, was not the worst advice at the time. And then we decided that the best path forward was to, you know, apply to Y Combinator.<br>
Aaron: I got to take a second just to explore something that actually seems so crazy. We just kind of passed over it, but Tracy, the fact that you and Ralph were dating and Ralph just happened to be the exact kind of engineer, the exact kind of a hacker that you needed to build this thing is one of those serendipitous moments that you can't plan. And it's something that I think that a lot of people, when they think about startups, are like, ""Oh, it's just about this or it's just about that."" But like these bits of luck, it's luck, really, are so important and while you can't really plan to have them, you can plan to be ready for them and it sounds like you totally were. If you had been like, ""Ah, you got to stop this Peanut thing with this crazy guy. That sounds like a terrible idea. I'm a Pixar engineer."" You could've said that. I mean, it would have been the wrong thing to say but, like everything kind of came together in a perfect way, which is, I don't know, kind of one of those unbelievable stories that's true. You couldn't write that and people would believe it.<br>
Ralph: Yeah. I mean, there's actually a lot of these incidences, I think, in PlanGrid story. I mean, one, the fact that I met Tracy. I would've just been some like [inaudible 00:13:05] spitting out startup ideas, have I not had this amazing editor and, later, leader of the company that I had just had, we just happened to have a personal connection, be friends. But even how I heard about Y Combinator is kind of a funny story. It's that, you know, I was at Stanford doing my masters in civil engineering and I was going through it really quickly. I did it in three quarters, so I didn't have a lot . . .<br>
Aaron: And while you're doing that, Tracy you're working on sites and Ralph, you're at Pixar, right?<br>
Ralph: Right. And then, literally I had, on a whim, signed up from some entrepreneurship club bases, which is actually a great thing, though I only ever went to one meeting, which is what I'm about to tell you about, and they had a last minute cancellation of a driver to go on a field trip to this thing called Y Combinator and I had no idea what it was, and so, I'm like bored on a Saturday. I'm like, sure, I'll drive people and I show up in my car. We drive down to Pioneer Way, I get out there and there's like 12 of us and Y Combinator isn't that famous then, and so Paul Graham personally . . .<br>
Aaron: This is in 2013?<br>
Ralph: No, this in 2010, no, no, no this is like in 20 . . .<br>
Tracy: 2008, 2009.<br>
Aaron: Oh, wow. So, this is, yeah... No one knew who we were. Yeah and so the building, by the way, is super unimpressive, if you don't know what it is. It's just like an empty room most of the time. There aren't really people around very frequently.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, exactly. I was not that impressed. I go in there, what's going on? Paul Graham comes out. He's this guy in shorts and Berks and he just, he blows my mind with his standard startup lecture where he does the graph on the wall with the trough of despair and the Tech Crunch initiation and whatnot.<br>
Aaron: Trough of sorrow.<br>
Ryan: And then I forget my bag on the way out, and he comes chasing after me with it. And that was how I first heard about Y Combinator was by accident from Paul Graham himself, basically, and three year, four years later, we're there interviewing with him for PlanGrid.<br>
Aaron: If you're just joining us, I'm Aaron Harris and you're listening to Startup School Radio. I'm talking with the co-founders of PlanGrid, who were just telling us some of the bits about how luck influenced the path of their company, right down from founding it to finding co-founders to even hearing about Y Combinator, which is a crazy set of coincidences, really, that kinda start leading you on the path. So, Ryan, you were just saying, okay, so you happened upon YC basically, met PG, Paul Graham. You're already talking about Peanuts with Tracy, right? You guys are already doing these meetings. Are you guys full time on this or it's still just a part time thing, right, 'cuz you're in school, Ryan's in school, Tracy's working and Ralph's working?<br>
Tracy: Mm-hmm. We were just working on it in the evenings, as a second job.<br>
Aaron: So Tracy, when do you get to the point where you decide, okay, screw our other jobs, screw the other things we're doing. This is what we want to do full time?<br>
Tracy: Yeah. So, our co-founder, Antoine Hersen, who joined on the condition that he would be Chief Mad Scientist, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer at 27 and I think it was sort of a life changing moment, learning that. We realized that our time here is not that long and in fact it's very short and so we might as well do something that we really love. And, at that point, Ralph and I quit our jobs, we took a train over to Chicago where Antoine was at, and we hung out with him and Peanuts was one thing we worked on and Ralph and Antoine actually worked on several games together. Do you want to talk more about that?<br>
Ralph: Yeah. I mean, it was a lot of fun taking off, not having to actually do a full time job and just kind of working on whatever we felt like. And one of the projects that we worked on that really pulled ahead was, of course, what would eventually become PlanGrid. Initially, when I started working on the problem, I thought, okay, no problem. I'll throw a PDF on an iPad. That's pretty standard stuff, honestly. So, I wrote the first prototype and it pretty much failed, like everything else out there with the iPad 1. It ran out of memory, it was slow, it was chunky and, through my experiences working with graphics, I'm actually a 2D graphic specialist, I made it a lot faster but it took a lot of time, took months and kind of seeing the product come into existence was one thing that really pulled me to work on something new, to work on something challenging that no one else had even done before. But the games with Antoine were actually a whole lot of fun.<br>
Aaron: I think this is something that a lot of people don't realize. Two things. One, the importance of just hacking on random stuff, the idea that you're not just working on PlanGrid at the time, you're working on other things, which kind of let's your mind sort of experience different things and, also, you don't know what's actually gonna be the thing. So, that's one thing, just that importance of experimenting and just building stuff, putting it out there and seeing what happens, but I think the thing that's also really crazy for me is there are a lot of people, like you said, who tried to put PDFs on iPads and you could've said, ""Look, the only thing you need to do to put blueprints on an iPad and make that a thing is just have a good PDF browser structure, a file structure, and just have your PDFs there."" But it doesn't work and that's why this is hard and that's why this is a real problem.<br>
Ralph: We actually, when I worked at Pixar, I worked on version control of large scale artist images so . . .<br>
Aaron: Which means what?<br>
Ralph: Basically, every bit of art that's done at Pixar is incredibly valuable and it changes constantly over time. So, they use them for references, artists will look at old versions of Woody from Toy Story 1 to make Toy Story 2 and those versions, there's a lot of these versions lying around, but one thing that they did very well was they didn't think about these pieces of art as files in a file system. They thought of them, more generically, as pieces of art that can be tagged and filtered in different ways. And this was the first thing we approached with PlanGrid as well. 'Cuz PlanGrid, we service the construction industry which doesn't necessarily mean they're super tech savvy, so to say. So, the dealing with files is actually a huge amount of complication for people. Even knowing what a PDF file is beyond a lot of people in the industry sometimes. So, as soon as you start dealing with files, you bring this whole structure with you, rather than just dealing with the blueprints like they were used to.<br>
Aaron: That's kind of crazy to think about, right? I mean, a blueprint as a piece of art, effectively, right? It's drawings on a page.<br>
Ralph: That's right.<br>
Aaron: And that idea of version control, it's something that makes sense to most of us, I think, when you think about a Word doc. You edit a Word doc, over time, you save different versions, or in Excel. That makes sense. I think, to most people but when it's lines on a page, it's harder to think about, I think, unless you have that unique experience of watching it happen at a place like Pixar, where then you can translate that over. So, I don't know, going back to that luck/serendipity thing, like, would anyone else have thought of that? No one else did, so.<br>
Ralph: I was pretty surprised by the luck as well, considering I had worked on a very similar problem before and also was an aspiring iOS programmer, writing kind of silly iOS apps that weren't really getting the traction I wanted.<br>
Aaron: And those are the games or other things as well?<br>
Ralph: I hesitate to mention many of them. Thankfully, this was back in iOS 3, iOS 4, so, thankfully, they've all been--<br>
Tracy: You should definitely download Hacker Typer.<br>
Ralph: No.<br>
Aaron: Hacker Typer. All right, we'll have to look it up. All right, so the two you are in Chicago and Ryan's still at Stanford. So, Tracy, what happens? Like, when do you actually come together and say, we're going? Because you're there, you're in Chicago with Antoine, so when do you actually start PlanGrid as PlanGrid and--<br>
Tracy: Yeah, yeah. So, it was Antoine and Ryan's dream to get into Y Combinator and applications opened up. We spent hours, like, just writing and re-writing our application. We were trying to input like all kinds of clever jokes into there. We really wanted to make the partners laugh and, like, let us into one of the interviews, and we were just, we were travelling by then and we get an email from Paul Graham. I don't remember exactly what, but do you remember Ryan?<br>
Ryan: Yeah. So, it's actually funny. So, we submit the application and we submit it through Hacker News, if you guys aren't familiar, it's like the startup Reddit, so to speak. But, in there, they have this system where you can have a message sent to you through Hacker News and it's clearly only used for startup applicants, 'cuz it's really rare and hard to find.<br>
Aaron: Basically, when you log into, when you go to Hacker News, there's a lot of news stories and if you've gotten a message about your application, there's just a little banner at the top of the page that you could pretty easily have missed that says, hey, you have a message.<br>
Ryan: And you don't get an email or anything so . . .<br>
Aaron: it's one of the most exciting things. It was a big step, by the way. You get an email now.<br>
Ryan: Well, at the time, there was just this line that was like, check regularly. So, you guys turned me into a Hacker News addict. I was just like checking it, like, every 30 seconds. And one day, I get a message back and it's like a one line question from Paul Graham. I don't even remember what the question was but it was like, ""How is this gonna be a real business?"" And I write a response really, we actually, I wake them up. They're, like, in Spain or something, at this point.<br>
Ralph: I remember the question.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. What was it?<br>
Ralph: The question was, ""How do you plan on getting past the barriers of IT departments with B to B, because normally the IT departments are the things blocking you from rolling out to large projects, and you're just going to be stopped at the gate."" It was a very good question, honestly.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. Which is, you know, it's one of these funny things because, you know, Paul Graham is not particularly an expert on the construction industry, but he's seen enough companies and he knows how these things work, that that's a super insightful question, because that's the barrier. Well, okay, you can design software. That's the first part of the challenge. It's getting it into people's hands and getting them using it. So, what was your answer?<br>
Tracy: The projects control their own destiny. They're going to buy whatever software that's . . .<br>
Aaron: It's an almost mystical statement.<br>
Tracy: Okay, all right. So, construction projects have their own budgets.<br>
Aaron: Interesting.<br>
Tracy: And so, a superintendent on a project can make the decision. If it's a tool that will help him or her deliver the project on time and on schedule, they will purchase that tool. And so, we don't have to talk to IT people.<br>
Aaron: Right. It's just a one person, so if a project engineer loves you, done. They'll buy the software.<br>
Tracy: Mm-hmm.<br>
Ryan: Right.<br>
Ralph: I would like to add that we love IT people now. They're great. If any IT people are listening, they're our favorite people.<br>
Ryan: They just take a little longer to convince than a superintendent who wants a new kind of hammer. Yeah, so, anyways, we answered that question and I assumed that we're going to get the same notification that we've got an interview through that same system, which turns out, I don't know, maybe you do now, but at that time, you don't and so I would refresh Hacker News 10 times a day for about a month or however long. . .<br>
Aaron: Come on, 10 times a day? More than that.<br>
Ryan: Like 50, yeah. Like, literally every waking moment. Anyways, eventually get an email, I think, from one of the partners. Maybe it was Paul Graham himself, but we got invited to the interview round, and so, which was like one of the most exciting and frightening things ever. And I remember getting the email and calling Tracy and Ralph, waking them up when they're somewhere in Europe, and then we go to the interview, eventually, at the same place where I saw Paul Graham. I asked him if he remembered me. Of course, he did not, and then--<br>
Aaron: Not, by the way, not something to take personally.<br>
Ryan: Right. No, I didn't. And then, in the interview, it was the four of us, with Antoine there, and it was like this blur. We had prepped so long for that interview. I think we had this list of 20 questions that we thought we would get asked and we drilled them over and over again, and then none of them got asked.<br>
Aaron: So, the interviews for YC are about 10 minutes long, and they sometimes go off on wild tangents but what we're always trying to get at is how you think about your business and how it's going to be that that huge business that P.G. was asking you about. Do you remember?<br>
Ralph: I do. Yeah. I remember the first question that was asked. We walked in, we sat down and P.G. immediately asked, I have a friend that's an architect and--<br>
Aaron: Probably Kate.<br>
Ryan: I don't know who he was referring to. I have a friend that's an architect and she says that paper plans are never going out of style. You can't see these things on blueprints. Papers the way that people want to interact with this. And we were just so ready for that question, surprisingly, even though it was a tough question, the toughest question that you could be asked. So, normally, when I talk to other people interested in YC, I always tell them to be just prepared for the worst question possible.<br>
Aaron: It's funny. It's both the worst question and, again, probably the most important thing, right, is what is the sort of starting energy cost? How do you overcome the inertia of an industry to fundamentally change it?<br>
Ralph: Do you guys remember how we answered it?<br>
Tracy: Oh yeah, of course. I mean, we had planned for this.<br>
Ralph: It was awesome.<br>
Tracy: So, I had a set of blueprints with me and I flip it open, and they both have an iPad, I think. Ryan has an iPad and he's trying to pull up a blueprint on Adobe Acrobat and a dialog box comes up and it says, out of memory and then, at the same time, Ralph has the beta in his hand, of PlanGrid at the time, and he's like, ""Can you see this?""<br>
Ryan: Oh, actually, you tried to show Paul Graham the blueprints as well, and those things are like eight point fonts on a 42 by 30 inch page. It's incredible.<br>
Aaron: So, you've got to zoom in all the way just to see it?<br>
Ryan: Exactly. So, she just showed him, from a distance, can you read this? And he's like, no. Bam! And then we zoom into the exact same spot.<br>
Aaron: Drop the blueprints and the iPad, walk out of the room.<br>
Ryan: More or less.<br>
Ralph: We had 10 minutes of intense growing grilling or something like that in between, b--<br>
Aaron: Yeah, I don't remember. I remember the first 30 seconds of my interview and I remember like one or two questions that got asked and that's pretty much it. All right. We clearly didn't get through remotely all of the PlanGrid story. We kind of had to scratch the surface on the beginning of the founding, so I'm going to demand that you guys come back as a group and talk through the rest of it, if you're cool with that. Because this is the first step in what's been a pretty awesome journey that isn't remotely done yet and I know there's a lot there for people to learn from.<br>
If you're just tuning in, I'm Aaron Harris. I've been speaking with Ryan, Tracy and Ralph of PlanGrid. Just ahead, Ryan's gonna stick with us as we're joined by Liz Wessel and J.J.

Woman: You're listening to Startup School Radio, powered by the Wharton School. Here again is Aaron Harris.<br>
Aaron: Welcome back to Startup School Radio on Business Radio, powered by the Wharton School, Sirius XM channel 111. I'm your host, Aaron Harris, a partner at Y Combinator. I've been speaking this half hour or this hour with the founders of PlanGrid and Ryan is back with us for the second half hour. Thanks for sticking with us, Ryan.<br>
Ryan: So happy to be here.<br>
Aaron: We're now joined by my next guests, Liz Wessel and J.J. Fliegelman, the co-founders of Campus Job. Campus Job is an online marketplace for college students to find jobs and internships while they're in school. And Liz and J.J. finished up Y Combinators winter 2015 batch just last week. They're here to talk about Campus Job, their YC experience, what they've learned, what they're going to do next as they fly back across the country. Thank you both for coming in today.<br>
Liz: Thank you for having us.<br>
J.J.: It's good to be here, Aaron.<br>
Aaron: If you're thinking of starting a company or you're an entrepreneur in the early stages of running a startup and have a question for us, we'd love to hear from you. Our number is 844-Wharton, that's 844-942-7866. You can also follow us on Twitter, @BizRadio111, or follow me, @Harris. So Liz, J.J., first of all, you're both Penn grads?<br>
Liz: Correct.<br>
J.J.: Yap.<br>
Aaron: And we're in Wharton's campus in San Francisco.<br>
Liz: Proud to be here.<br>
Aaron: Good job. Good job, Wharton, good job Penn, making such great founders for Y Combinator to fund. I want to start, as I normally do, of just talking a little bit about where Campus Job came from. You're both fairly recent college grads. I think you're, are you both two or three years out?<br>
Liz: Three and four years.<br>
Aaron: Three and four years out. Okay, not too far removed from college, building something for colleges. Did Campus Job come from, like, have you wanted to do this since college, or what happened that you decided to start this company?<br>
Liz: Yeah. So, J.J. and I actually became close friends during college because we, along with a few other friends, decided to start a company that was kind of the inspiration for what Campus Job is today. So, that company was a much more niche version. We didn't even call it a company. It was more of a side project, but it was something we worked on our senior year of college. We built it, we graduated and it started to take off after we graduated.<br>
Aaron: What was it?<br>
Liz: It was basically a job board for campus rep opportunities. So, like everything from Microsoft, to Group Me campus reps to NGO campus reps, etc.<br>
<br>
Aaron: So, these are the students who will wear a Red Bull t-shirt around campus, hand out free Red Bull and get frats to join.<br>
Liz: Exactly, exactly.<br>
J.J.: The most popular kids on campus.<br>
Aaron: They got free stuff to give. Everyone loves free stuff, especially college kids.<br>
Liz: Exactly. So, we saw a big need for startups looking for students to hire and for students looking for marketing jobs on campus, so we started that side project in college. It started to really take off and, over a few years, when we were doing nothing related to it, and really had our own full time jobs, we decided to use the inspiration from what that side project was and actually quit our jobs at Google and McKenzie and start Campus Job and go big for all jobs for college students.<br>
Aaron: This is one of those decisions that's like every mother's nightmare. My son and daughter quit their jobs at Google and at McKenzie, two of the best companies to work at in the world, to go do something crazy, like start a company where they're not going to get paid and probably starve to death. So, what was it about this idea that made you leave such comfortable careers?<br>
J.J.: Well, I think for me, there were two things. One was even just this side project that Liz was just talking about, seeing that traction grow while we were doing nothing was really inspiring and also helped us realize that there was something there. Imagine if we really put effort into it and really, really made it work. It could be huge. Then, for me, the second piece was, honestly, working with Liz. I hope she's not going to be blushing right now, but I believed in her and I believed in us and a team and, for me, that was what made me reach out to her, as I was coming towards realizing I want to leave and do something big and I wanted to do with her.<br>
Liz: The feeling is very mutual, and then I will also say, we kinda figured if we were going to do this idea, which we knew we wanted to do, now was the time because we're close enough to college age, where we still know what the big problems are and how to tackle them and so, we're risk takers and Google and Mackenzie, we can always go back to them if we needed to, but I think Campus Job now, even better place to work, so we're happy.<br>
J.J.: We were talking to, just talking about the role of luck in the founding of startups, where Ryan's co-founders, Tracy and Ralph, were dating. Tracy was an engineer on construction sites and Ralph just happened to be an engineer focused on graphics and version control at Pixar and they said, well, we want to do something with blueprints and he's like, I'm the perfect guy to do that. So, I don't know, Ryan, if you're listening to this story of two people who happen to be friends in college, who happened to start something that happened to grow while they were away from it. If you're having like, oh my God, it's all luck.<br>
Ryan: Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm sure only part of it is serendipity but I think also that people that like to work on big problems. I like to believe, this is probably sort of silly, that they just naturally are attracted to one another. Sometimes in a romantic sense like Ralph and Tracy, but in this case, not so much, but just they're kindred spirits. So, risk takers, I think, maybe just sort of find each other.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
Liz: I will mention, by the way, we actually didn't become friends before the side project. I actually stalked him because I went through--<br>
Aaron: Now it's getting a little creepy, but all right.<br>
Liz: I looked, I hacked into the Hackathon database of hackers at Penn and I went through every resume of the hackers at Penn and only one stood out as being the person I had to work with on this side project, and it was J.J. And so I emailed him and . . .<br>
Aaron: Now J.J.'s blushing, by the way.<br>
J.J.: I get this email out nowhere from some girl Liz Wessel and she's like, ""Hey, we have a lot of friends in common who told me that we should meet,"" and I'm like on Facebook. I'm like, ""We have no friends in common. Who are you?""<br>
Aaron: Maybe very little serendipity in this case.<br>
Liz: But it worked out.<br>
Aaron: Not serendipity at all, totally manufactured meeting. All right, that is one of the best, best stories of founders meeting that I've heard in a while. Okay, so, all right. Liz, you hunt J.J. down, you guys build this side project in college, but it's not enough of a thing to get you to do it right in college, right?<br>
Liz: Yeah. I mean, our plan was literally to do it and then graduate and go on to our own, other careers. It was always just a side project.<br>
Aaron: Why?<br>
J.J.: I think we both did it because we were approaching the end of college. We knew we had a limited amount of time to do something totally crazy before we went on to do ""real people things.""<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
J.J.: This was a great opportunity to do something really, really cool that we wouldn't have time for later.<br>
Liz: Also, I think the funny thing is, it didn't, like, take off or anything while we were in college. It was after we stopped doing anything and touching it that, all of the sudden, we graduate, forget it exists, and it just starts to grow.<br>
Aaron: This is like the super fascinating thing about startups and kind of the heart of Y Combinator's motto, which is make something people want. It's make something people want that they're gonna want, even if you're not shoving it down their throats.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: Reddit's also a really good example of this, in a lot of ways. Alexis and Steve found it and they work really hard on growing its initial user base. Then, they sell it, and they're not working on it full time. No one's really working on it full time, aside from maintaining it and it just grows and grows over time and then, now it's a behemoth and people are working on it really hard and have been for a few years. But, when you make something that people actually really want, they find it and they use it and they continue to use it, as long as it doesn't break. J.J. how much time were you spending on it in sort of the intervening years, just to make sure the thing stayed up?<br>
J.J.: Shockingly little, like, embarrassingly little.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
J.J.: But there just wasn't, there wasn't much to do.<br>
Aaron: It was just a job board.<br>
J.J.: Very simple site, job board, didn't look that great, to be totally honest.<br>
Aaron: Right.<br>
J.J. And people just signed up.<br>
Liz: Just to be clear, Campus Job is not a job board.<br>
J.J.: Campus Job looks great and it's a marketplace.<br>
Liz: It looks great.<br>
Aaron: It is, in fact, quite beautiful.<br>
J.J.: Oh, thank you.<br>
Aaron: So, all right. So, this niche, what was the original thing called?<br>
Liz: The Campus Rep.<br>
Aaron: The Campus Rep, going to the Campus Job. I like how you did that.<br>
Liz: And then we dropped the ""the,"" in a Facebook matter.<br>
Aaron: Yeah, exactly. So, it's just Campus Job. I like the progression. Pretty soon, it'll just be Campus.<br>
J.J.: Or just Job.<br>
Aaron: Or just Job, or Job. So, you both leave your jobs because you think that this thing actually has legs. It's growing without you doing anything. You say, you know what? This is our chance. We have a little bit of money in the bank. We can take this risk. It's a chance to do it. What happens next?<br>
Liz: So, we actually, we decided to shut down the Campus Rep because it was so different than anything we pictured could be the correct way to approach the problem, the bigger problem of all campus jobs and internships. So, we shut down the Campus Rep and we e-mailed all those users once and said, ""We'll never bother you again, but there's this new website in town, CampusJob.com. We recommend you check it out.""<br>
Aaron: How many people were on that email list?<br>
Liz: A couple, like, several thousand that didn't bounce back, because a lot of students had probably graduated, etc. So, we had a little bump. So, I actually had been working at Google in India, moved back from India July 1st, quit Google July 15th. J.J. was working full time on the site all of July. We raised about a million dollars in seed funding by July 31st, launched the site in September and it just started to grow, and so . . .<br>
Aaron: That's, I mean, that's actually crazy. You both, you quit your jobs, middle of July, beginning of July, middle of July are working on it for 15 to 30 days and you raise a million bucks. That's a lot of money to give to two people who have just started really working on something. So, why do you think that happened? Why do you think you got the money?<br>
Liz: I think, at least for me, the main thing that investors kept saying was the fact that they all saw this problem, not just from themselves when they were in college, and I'm talking like 60-year-olds to 25-year year-olds, who all saw this problem of how hard it is to find a part time job or internship or even full time job after school, but also all of their startups and their portfolios were so desperately trying to hire college students, whether it was for summer internships or campus rep jobs, etc., and so they all saw this need, from both the user and the employer perspective.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
J.J.: And I think even once we're getting past the first meeting where we get to tell that story, I think, I hope that we were able to show them that we meant business by, when Liz went in for the first meeting, she would listen to their feedback and if they had feedback on a product feature or something, by the next meeting, it would exist or it would have changed, or I would've just built it. And that was a really cool thing to come back to an investor with.<br>
Aaron: So, this is an interesting thing and actually kind of a challenge, where investors or people who aren't your core demographic of users will suggest features because they think it would be cool. How did you decide whether or not that feature was actually something that your users wanted, right? Your users are the important thing here, not really your investors. So, how did you decide what to build and what not to build?<br>
Liz: I think at the very beginning, it was honestly us checking our gut. I don't think, we were based near a lot of NYU students at the very start and so, we would go and talk to NYU students as much as possible, but, very often, people don't know what they want until they get it and then they can complain or compliment. And so, at the very beginning, it was trusting our gut.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. I think that this is something, I love the parallels to PlanGrid's story, where Ryan and Tracy were their original users, right? You were, you needed blueprints.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, I mean, in our case, Y Combinators always stressing talking to users, but, in our case, there are four founders and two of them were the users.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
Ryan: And so, the way the product basically got built is, we were able to iterate five, six times a day on features where just Tracy and I were, would be like, this is exactly what it needs to do, and then Ralph and Antoine would find a way to make it happen. But, yeah, I mean, without talking to users or being a user yourself, I don't know how you can ever get the right features, because the stuff that investors would suggest to us were, like my wife's an architect. It should do this. Well, that doesn't actually make any sense. But, if you're not confident, you can be misled real easily.<br>
Aaron: If you're just joining us, I'm Aaron Harris and you're listening to Startup School Radio. My guests right now are Ryan Sutton-Gee from PlanGrid and Liz Wessel and J.J. Fliegelman from Campus Job. We were just talking about the importance of talking to your users and how valuable it is for you to be your own users. And Ryan, I think you just put it perfectly, which is, when you are your own user, your cycle of iteration, especially early on, is dramatically faster, and this is why we talk about solving your own problem. I mean, you could solve a problem for an astronaut, smart people, I'm sure you could figure out things. But if you're not an astronaut, you're going to have to go and check with the astronaut every single time you need to make a change, whereas if it's your own, Liz, you kept talking about trusting your gut and looking at your gut. And you were your original users. You were Campus Reps. You weren't so far out of college that you had forgotten what it was like. So, you were able to test and say, ""Huh, will this make my life better? Would this have made my life better?"" And if the answer is yes, you can move forward and then see sort of what your users actually do with it.<br>
Liz: And we even, everything down to like the language on the website, when you try to log out as a student, we show you a video of a guy being slapped across the face in slow motion and we say, are you sure you want to log out? This is how you're making us feel. Like, we really try to have that sense of humor and speak to our users the way we would want to be spoken to.<br>
Aaron: Yeah. I remember Groupon used to do that.<br>
Liz: Yeah.<br>
Aaron: Groupon spent a lot of time making people laugh if they tried to do things.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: Especially when it was something they didn't want them to do. It was like, hey, if I leave you with a positive impression, maybe you'll still leave but you're going to remember me and tell other people about it and probably come back at some point.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: Okay. So, you raise a million bucks and I'm guessing you just go out to fancy dinners, blow it all on nice clothes or whatever. So, what do you actually do once you have money? How does it change the way you operate and change the way you start building the business?<br>
J.J.: One of the very first things we did was we started using Campus Job to hire campus reps to help build out our marketplace, to help out with the student side.<br>
Aaron: So, the Campus Rep might have been dead but not really.<br>
Liz: Exactly. So, we hired our first employee right away. Nikki, who would run a Campus Rep program, that she sourced all the Campus Reps from Campus Job. We were very fortunate in that our lead investors gave us their office space for free. So, we didn't have to spend money on that, so we actually had an incredibly low burn rate at the very start, especially because we were paying our Campus Reps on a performance basis. So, we weren't just throwing out money. It was, if they delivered, then we would pay.<br>
Aaron: That is, I can't stress enough how important it is to do what Liz just said, which is keep your burn rate low. We just had our last dinner for YC's winter 2015 batch last night and I think the most frequent piece of advice we gave was keep your burn low. Even if you raise a million dollars, it seems like a lot of money, and people say, I could never spend that much but my partner Paul [inaudible 00:43:41] likes to say, it's not your money and I think a lot of people miss that and they go and spend it on, frankly, stupid stuff. When that money should be treated as last money you'll ever raise and that's what you'll need to get to profitability. And you did that, right? You were super smart with it, which is, I think, sort of indicative of you being good as founders and doing your jobs right.<br>
<br>
So you get performance based fees for people hiring and you're working on the site, you got free office space. Then what?<br>
Liz: Then we just focus on building and growing everything. The employer side, we tried everything, every sales idea we could come up with before we were able to hire our first actual salesperson, which didn't happen until January.<br>
Aaron: And the salespeople for hiring clients, students . . .<br>
Liz: For getting employers to post jobs, yeah. We don't consider students customers, because they don't pay us. They just use the site for free to find jobs.<br>
Aaron: How do you make money?<br>
Liz: Employers pay per applicant that they receive.<br>
Aaron: That's cool.<br>
Liz: So, if a student clicks apply through our site, they don't get brought to a new site where they have to fill out a form. Their application gets submitted right there to the business, and then every time they click apply, we make money and the employer is the one who pays that money.<br>
Aaron: So, you're kind of lifting a page from Google's playbook, which is people pay us when people click on useful things, basically.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: And so, you start bringing in employers and you start getting students. How quickly do you start growing?<br>
Liz: Quick.<br>
J.J.: Pretty fast. Pretty fast.<br>
Liz: So, we had a couple of thousand students at the very, day one, just because of the fact that we transferred them over from, oh, we didn't transfer. We emailed all the students from the old website and then, at the very start, our Campus Reps were really good and they just hit the ground running and I think, at the end of the day, they can plant the seeds on their campus but what creates a network effect is when you see your friend got a really cool job and you ask them how they got that job and they say CampusJob.com and, all of a sudden, they sign up for CampusJob.com. And so, we used our Campus Reps to plant the seeds and then we knew we would only grow via network effect, which is the way we believe we should grow, if we were delivering jobs.<br>
So, at the end of the day it was all about get as many employers and as many students as possible and, right now, with our marketplace, we're definitely not signing up as many employers as we are students. So, we've really been focusing on growing out the employer side.<br>
Aaron: Right. Although you wouldn't expect to have quite as many employers as students.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: But you want growth rates that look good on both sides, so that the marketplace is healthy. We've been thinking about different marketplaces and thinking about how these things grow, you have this challenge of chickens and eggs, right? You need one to get the other. And it sounds like you started out, you kind of cheated, right? Because you started out with both, because of the Campus Rep. You knew both sides a little bit, which is kind of the way to do it. You can't, I mean. . .<br>
Liz: We cheated a little bit but I will say our revenue model made it so that it was a no risk, no brainer for businesses, because you don't pay us a dime unless you get applicants who, by the way, are qualified to apply. Because when a business posts a job, they say, I only want computer science students with a 4.0, who attend MIT and who speak Spanish to apply to my job. And we will only show your job to students who match these qualifications. And it's free until someone applies and then you pay a few bucks. And so, at the end of the day, it really was a no risk solution for businesses.<br>
Aaron: That's interesting. Ralph from PlanGrid just told us that the first question that Paul Graham asked was basically how you are going to convince IT departments to actually use the thing, because it's the business, B to B problem, enterprise sales are hard. And you guys, I think Ryan got around it by basically saying, it's not the IT departments, right?<br>
Ryan: Right, yeah. Those aren't the ones that actually buy it.<br>
Aaron: Right. And I think, Liz, you guys got around this in a different, slightly different way, which was we don't have to sell you anything, it's actually free. Right? If it works for you, give us a little money. If not, it's no harm, no foul, which is a pretty easy sell if you're saying we're going to send you great candidates.<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: So, you're in New York, you're building it, it's going great. You have money. Why on earth did you move out to California to do YC for three months?<br>
J.J: Well, we met this great guy named Aaron Harris.<br>
Aaron: Oh, thanks, thanks.<br>
J.J.: No, but really, you were hugely influential. When we, I remember when we first spoke at Joe's Coffee and I was just really excited that I was introduced to you to talk about marketplaces. You were just telling us about more, in more detail about Y Combinator and what it could do for a company like ours and how it could really help us grow. Since, like Liz was just saying, we raised the money, we were focusing very strongly on talking to users, shaping futures and growing. [inaudible 00:48:28]<br>
Aaron: You were actually doing all the things we tell companies to do, which is why I was excited. I was like, Oh wow, they're already doing this stuff. We should just get them in because they don't have to do very much to help them.<br>
Liz: Which you did, by the way. But, yeah, you, J.J. came back from a meeting with you and said, ""I think we should apply to Y Combinator."" And I was very hesitant because I saw that our growth was continuing, and that things were going well and I said, ""Why change it? Why not, as you guys actually say, whatever's working to grow your company, keep doing that.""<br>
Aaron: Right.<br>
Liz: So, I said, ""Why would we move to California? We have a small team, etc."" But we started speaking to a lot of other Y Combinator companies, some who had traction as well before YC. And everyone just spoke the world of it and promised that they wouldn't regret it. One person even said, ""I'll buy you your entire seed round that you won't regret it,"" and so I took her up on that and there's no regrets. We are beyond thrilled.<br>
Aaron: So, you don't have to give her all the seed round money?<br>
Liz: Exactly.<br>
Aaron: So, you guys came to YC in the end of 20, I mean, you applied sort of the end of 2014. Y Combinator was a known quantity. You knew what you were getting into. Ryan, when you applied, I mean, five years ago?<br>
Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, God, it's been that long hasn't it? Just four years ago.<br>
Aaron: Did you have any, I mean, you didn't even know what YC was until you accidently drove there.<br>
Ryan: Yeah, I mean, after being there and then you hear the stories of Reddit, and AirBNB and Dropbox, which were successes then, though nothing like they are now, and really what convinced me the most is just, like, within, like, literally within 30 minutes of Paul Graham talking about startups as an idea, like, as an economic, why they're economically powerful, and how, if you're a young, ambitious person, it's literally the most leveraged thing you can do. And he just upended my entire view of, like, what it means to, not even have a career, but what it means to work on things, period, and to build stuff. And so, once I had that, then it's, like, okay, how do I get to be one of these ambitious people that has really leveraged what they're working on?<br>
Aaron: I want to try an experiment, because you both went through YC in sort of different time periods, obviously, but, Ryan, if you had to boil YC down to two, I say, maximum two things, what would you say, what did we tell you to do at YC? What's the thing?<br>
Ryan: Yeah. I mean, obviously it's make something people want.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
Ryan: In our case, it was what we wanted and what, which by proxy, what the construction industry wanted, and the other thing is that it's just, there's so much institutional knowledge, in getting incorporated, finding employees, raising money, getting exposed, how not to be a founder team and fight over equity. There's just so many of the shortcuts that three months of Y Combinator easily saved us three years.<br>
Aaron: That's awesome.<br>
Ryan: If we had to iterate through it, it probably would have killed us as a company or somebody would have beat us to the punch.<br>
Aaron: Yeah.<br>
Ryan: So, it's just an amazing, like, super amazing shortcut on so many levels.<br>
Aaron: And Liz and J.J., what would you guys say, like, the two most important things that you learned at YC?<br>
J.J.: I think I learned focus on what matters.<br>
Aaron: Mm-hmm.<br>
J.J.: And the focus part is sometimes actually easier than figuring out what it is that matters to your business, but you have to be thoughtful about it and once you know, you can't let anything else destruct you.<br>
Aaron: And Liz, I'm gonna let you have the last word. What would you say you learned?<br>
Liz: I was going to say number one focus, and number two, grow and just focus on whatever makes you grow.<br>
Aaron: You know, it's funny. I'll edit that slightly. When we talk about focus and growth, people sometimes get it slightly wrong. They say growth is all we care about, but it's the focus that leads to the growth. Without that focus, you don't actually have the growth.<br>
