"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
Beauty queen of only eighteen<br>
She had some trouble with herself<br>
He was always there to help her<br>
She always belonged to someone else<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
I drove for miles and miles<br>
And wound up at your door<br>
I've had you so many times<br>
But somehow, I want more<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I don't mind spending every day<br>
Out on your corner in the pouring rain<br>
Look for the girl with the broken smile<br>
Ask her if she wants to stay a while<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
And she will be loved<br>
And she will bе loved<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I<br>
Want to make you feel beautiful<br>
I know I tеnd to get so insecure<br>
Doesn't matter anymore<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
It's not always rainbows and butterflies<br>
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah<br>
My heart is full and my door's always open<br>
You come any time you want, yeah<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I don't mind spending every day<br>
Out on your corner in the pouring rain<br>
Look for the girl with the broken smile<br>
Ask her if she wants to stay a while<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
And she will be loved<br>
And she will be loved<br>
And she will be loved<br>
And she will be loved<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I know where you hide<br>
Alone in your car<br>
Know all of the things that make you who you are<br>
I know that goodbye means nothing at all<br>
Comes back and makes me catch her<br>
Every time she falls, yeah<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I<br>
Want to make you feel beautiful<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I don't mind spending every day<br>
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh<br>
Look for the girl with the broken smile<br>
Ask her if she wants to stay a while<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
And she will be loved<br>
And she will be loved<br>
And she will be loved<br>
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)<br>
And she will be loved<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh)<br>
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye<br>
(I don't mind spending every day, ooh)<br>
(Out on your corner in the pouring rain)<br>
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye</p>

"<p>[Chorus]<br>
Tell me, am I ever gonna feel again?<br>
Tell me, am I ever gonna heal again?<br>
Got a shot glass full of tears<br>
Drink, drink, drink, say ""Cheers""<br>
I got all these diamonds running down my face<br>
And I ain't letting any of 'em go to waste<br>
Got a shot glass full of tears<br>

Like chasing after the sun<br>
And making me fall in love<br>
Till I'm sick to my stomach (Sick to my stomach)<br>

Until I'm driving a hundred<br>
With my hands off the wheel<br>
Just to see how it feels<br>

<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
It's a hard pill to swallow<br>
This emotion I bottle<br>
Need something strong for the sorrow<br>
Something strong for the pain<br>
So, I can wash it away<br>
I was cold, now, I'm freezing (Cold, now, I'm freezing)<br>
Stuck in a permanent season (Permanent season)<br>
And we both know you're the reason (Know you're the reason)<br>
I'm not the same as before<br>
I don't feel anymore<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Tell me, am I ever gonna feel again?<br>
Tell me, am I ever gonna heal again?<br>
Got a shot glass full of tears<br>

<hr><p>For the last two months, I've been immersed in the fascinating world of paranormal investigation. Full disclosure: I love ghost stories. Even if you don't really believe in ghosts, it's fun to suspend disbelief. You dim the lights, set the mood, and tell the scariest story you can think of. And it's fun because we know it's probably not real. Ghosts don't actually exist. Do they?</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: Do you believe in ghosts?<br>
WOMAN: Depends.<br>
ALEX: On what?<br>
WOMAN: On why you're asking me. Is there a ghost behind me?<br>
<br>
ALEX: Excuse me?<br>
WOMAN: Yes?<br>
ALEX: Do you believe in ghosts?<br>
WOMAN: Um, I do actually.<br>
ALEX: Really? Have you seen one?<br>
WOMAN: I haven't seen one, but I heard one when I was younger.<br>
ALEX: You heard one?<br>
WOMAN: Yeah, I came home from school one day and I swore I heard my mother in the kitchen. And I went in there, and there and there was nobody there. And I called my mom and she was still at work, so.<br>
ALEX: Were you scared?<br>
WOMAN: Yeah, yeah.<br>
<br>
ALEX: Do you believe in ghosts?<br>
MAN: No, no. I think that people are just either looking for attention, or schizophrenic.<br>
ALEX: So it's all a hoax?<br>
MAN: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Except, there was this one time...<br>

WOMAN: Because I was in the Tower of London.</a><br>
ALEX: Ohh.</blockquote><hr><p>Okay, it's time for a bit of background. Rather than just diving into our first story, I think I need to explain what happened, how things changed. The reality is, this podcast started as one thing, but very quickly became something else. At a certain point, my producers and I had to make a decision. Do we stick with our original vision or do we follow the interesting, confusing, and occasionally macabre story that had started spilling out around the edges?<br>
<br>
As most of our listeners probably know, I've been working as a segment producer and occasional guest host on Pacific Northwest Stories for three years. <a href=""/12649345/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/A-few-months-ago-nic-one-of-my-producers-suggested-a-spin-off-series-we-would-examine-interesting-lives-remarkable-occupations-and-amazing-stories"" data-id=""12649345"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">A few months ago, Nic, one of my producers, suggested a spin-off series. We would examine interesting lives, remarkable occupations, and amazing stories.</a> Our first episode was a good one. We would dive into the crazy world of paranormal researchers or ghost hunters.<br>
<br>
As our podcast began to change, we went back and forth on how to proceed. After numerous lengthy discussions, we decided that we would let things play out exactly as they happen to us. You will experience the events just as we experience them. I'll step in every once in a while to help guide you through it. But other than those interruptions, we're going to let things play out exactly as they happened.<br>
It's The Black Tapes Podcast. I'm Alex Reagan. Stay with us.</p>

<hr><blockquote>RAYMOND: The first thing you need to know about paranormal research is that none of it is normal.</blockquote><p>That's Raymond Savorski. He's written five books on paranormal phenomena and is considered by his ghost hunting peers a pioneer in paranormal investigative techniques. He's tall and thin. But a healthy willowy thin. He's a man who cares about his appearance and his food. He sent his salad back twice during our lunch meeting because his arugula was too bitter. We'll speak more with Mr. Savorski in a moment.<br>
<br>
According to a government poll from 2013, 45% of Americans believe in ghosts, 64% believe in life after death, and 43% believe that ghosts are capable of interacting with and sometimes even harming people. That's a staggering number of North Americans who believe that death is not the end of life. Ghost hunting has become a multi-million dollar industry. Walmart sells a ghost hunting kit for both beginner and intermediate level would-be ghost hunters. We decided I would interview three well-known paranormal researchers.</p>

<blockquote>RAYMOND: So, no matter who you ask, it basically boils down to three types of hauntings. Residual energy, intelligent haunting, and inhuman haunting.<br>
<br>
EMILY: When it comes to what people generally witness as paranormal phenomena, we usually get three types. Orbs or mist, full-body apparitions, and demonic presence.</blockquote><p>That's Dr. Emily Dumont. She's another paranormal researcher and author of a best-selling book on the subject of location hauntings.</p>

<blockquote>DIRK: I've seen all types of paranormal apparitions. Whoever tells you there are three categories of hauntings is full of ****.</blockquote><p><a href=""/12649441/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Thats-dirk-abruzzi-the-host-of-the-popular-reality-tv-show-demon-hunters"" data-id=""12649441"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">That's Dirk Abruzzi, the host of the popular reality TV show, <i>Demon Hunters</i>.</a></p>

<blockquote>DIRK: We're human. The things we chase are not.<br>
ALEX: So how do you respond to critics who say that this field is not a science, but rather a pseudoscience?<br>
DIRK: Pseudoscience. Yeah, I've heard that one. Well I would ask them to accompany me on an investigation to see the rigor with which we conduct our experiments. We have actual experiments.<br>

Dirk: They're jealous they didn't think of it before we did.<br>
ALEX: Well, to be honest, I've been hearing this from several people.<br>
DIRK: You're talking about Strand right? Don't waste your time.</a>
</blockquote><p>Of course, I wasn't talking about Strand. Not yet. I wasn't talking about anyone in particular. But I started to notice that name, Strand, kept coming up.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: Does the criticism ever get personal?<br>
RAYMOND: There's no avoiding that type of character assassination. The ones that tend to sting more are the fellow academics, like Vogel or Strand. It's like they got a vendetta against the whole field of paranormal research. You know Strand's reputation, more of a writer than anything else.<br>
<br>
EMILY: Dr. Strand is well known in our circles, but probably not the way he'd like. How do you say this politely? He puts a lot of passion into work that would benefit from more clinical objectivity.<br>
<br>

What makes him such a lightning rod for criticism is that he doesn't believe in the paranormal. He's a ghost hunter who doesn't believe in ghosts. In fact, not only does he not believe in paranormal phenomena, for the past decade he has been on a mission to debunk all claims of the supernatural.<br>
And Strand is putting his money where his mouth is. Since 1998, The Strand Institute has been offering a million dollar reward for any proof of the supernatural.</a> As you can imagine, he hasn't made a lot of friends in the ghost hunting community. Here he is at a gathering of the Institute of Paranormal Research in St. Louis four years ago.</p>

<blockquote>[Recording playback begins]<br>

All you have is a number of witnesses and their claims. That's not good science.<br>
MODERATOR: A few more questions before we let Dr. Strand go. Yes, in the blue shirt?<br>
FEMALE ATTENDEE #1: Let's assume that what you say is true. Let's say everyone on the panel next to you is engaging in bad science. You haven't brought anything to the table that disproves anything.<br>
[Applause]<br>
STRAND: I am not making extraordinary claims against the laws of nature already established by the larger scientific community. I don't have to prove that gravity exists, that cells die, that life ends. We know these things. The burden is on my colleagues to prove that life doesn't end in death. And they haven't provided anything other than weak conjecture.<br>
[Murmuring]<br>
MODERATOR: Okay, you in the black and gold in the back.<br>
FEMALE ATTENDEE #2: Why not let people who take comfort in fairy tales hold onto their illusions?<br>
STRAND: It's similar to drug addiction. The addict needs escape.<br>

STRAND: … No.<br>
MALE ATTENDEE #1: What about the Sagamore?</a><br>
[Thumping] [Recording playback ends]</blockquote><p>And that's when the power went out - perfect timing for a ghost convention. Dr. Strand is a controversial figure in the world of paranormal research. So why does he do it? Why devote his life to something he doesn't believe in?</p>

<hr><blockquote>MELISSA: Hello, this is a message for Alex Reagan. It's Melissa calling on behalf of Dr. Strand. I'm afraid he won't be able to meet with you at this time. He wanted to thank you for your interest in his work.<br>
<br>
EMILY: Those are most of the books I've written on the subject.</blockquote><p>That's Dr. Emily Dumont, whom you heard earlier. My producer and I flew to Chicago hoping to meet with Dr. Strand, but we haven't been able to set up a meeting. So I asked Dr. Dumont if she had time to give me a tour of her office. She teaches religious studies at the University of Illinois in Urbana. Emily Dumont is what you might call stout, with short bangs and a Ramones t-shirt. Her huge brown eyes are filled with the sparkle and energy of a much younger woman. Her office is fairly big, but hard to move around in. Hundreds of scrapbooks and photo albums are packed onto wall to wall bookshelves. In the corner, an ancient popcorn maker from a movie theater appears to be in working order.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: <i>Field Guide to the Paranormal, Ghost Hunting for Dummies, Monsters and Magic, A Guide to Ethereal Beings, Past Lives and Your Wedding</i>. How many books have you written?<br>
EMILY: Seventeen.<br>
ALEX: Wow.<br>
EMILY: Another four as co-author and some fiction.<br>

EMILY: Not at all. Why would you say that?<br>
ALEX: I just, it kind of seems like some of the...<br>
EMILY: My fiction is more personal. More <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>. But darker, and far more literary.</a>
</blockquote><p>I spent about an hour or so with Miss Dumont in her office. I think she was a little offended that I mentioned fiction in the same breath as paranormal investigation. It's something I'd been noticing across the board. To a person, all the paranormal researchers I spoke with were a bit touchy about the public and scientific perception of their work. It felt like they were worried they wouldn't be taken seriously. Fair enough. Ms. Dumont came back around pretty quickly. Just as I was about to thank her for her time, she made me an offer I couldn't refuse.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: What are those?<br>
EMILY: Photo albums featuring local events. Each one is a case I've investigated.<br>
ALEX: All of them?<br>
EMILY: Yeah.<br>
ALEX: What kind of cases?<br>
EMILY: Mainly apparitions. Serial hauntings. This section is demonic, Sumerian, Babylonian, <a href=""/12649524/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Lovecraftian"" data-id=""12649524"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Lovecraftian</a>. These are mainly Christian and more traditional demonics.</blockquote><p><a href=""/12649524/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Lovecraftian"" data-id=""12649524"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">I was going to mention the fact that HP Lovecraft was a fiction writer</a>, but after her reaction the last time I brought up the subject of fiction, I decided to let it go. Back in her office, Dumont describes the contents of one of her many bookshelves.</p>

<blockquote>EMILY: These ones are poltergeists, water spirits, these are shadows and shades. The rest are complex and simple possession cases, along with a few collections of chem-trail evidence.<br>
ALEX: Wow. I'd love to take a closer look at some of this stuff.<br>
EMILY: We're going to a psychiatric hospital this evening to explore three separate claims of residual poltergeist activity. You're welcome to come along if you'd like, but you'll have to sign a release. It could be quite dangerous, spiritually.<br>
<br>
MELISSA: Hey Alex, we received your last couple of messages. Thank you for your interest in speaking with Dr. Strand. He's very busy this week. Unfortunately, we're unable to schedule any kind of sit down interview. If you call back next week, maybe we can set something up over the phone or Skype. Thank you again for your interest in Dr. Strand. Goodbye.</blockquote><p>If you had told me three weeks ago when my producers and I were outlining this show that I would be walking through an abandoned mental hospital looking for evidence of residual poltergeist activity, I'd probably have politely suggested you be committed. But that's exactly where I ended up. And so you will you, if you stay with us after the break.</p>

<hr><blockquote>ALEX: Hey Emily. Sorry, we got a little lost.<br>
EMILY: Did you turn on Lakeview?<br>
ALEX: I think so.<br>
EMILY: It used to go right through, but now there's a divider so you need to go around 9th Avenue past that little coffee-boat [?] drive-thru.<br>
ALEX: Oh.<br>
Donnie: Hey, I'm Donnie.<br>
EMILY: Oh I'm sorry, this is Donnie. He'll be running most of our equipment. And this is Tina, our clairvoyant.<br>
TINA: Nice to meet you.<br>
ALEX: Nice to meet you too. Emily, on your website it mentions that you're a clairvoyant as well?<br>
EMILY: I'm a medium by profession, but I experience some light clairvoyance.<br>
ALEX: Oh. Okay. How far is the hospital from here?<br>
EMILY: We're here.<br>
ALEX: Where?<br>
EMILY: There!</blockquote><p>City Trust is a small credit union that sat near the shore of Lake Manteno since 1987. It is about an hour south of Chicago. It doesn't look haunted. In fact, it's basically the corner of a strip mall. But its location has a more notorious history. Okay. Disclosure time. Dumont alluded to us creeping around an abandoned mental hospital, not a small town credit union.</p>

<blockquote><a href=""/12649540/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Emily-this-spot-is-where-what-became-known-as-the-manteno-madness-happened-it-was-1939-almost-400-of-the-patients-came-down-with-typhoid-fever-it-was-awful-at-least-100-patients-ended-up-dying"" data-id=""12649540"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">EMILY: This spot is where what became known as the Manteno Madness happened. It was 1939, almost 400 of the patients came down with typhoid fever. It was awful. At least 100 patients ended up dying.</a></blockquote><p><a href=""/12649540/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Emily-this-spot-is-where-what-became-known-as-the-manteno-madness-happened-it-was-1939-almost-400-of-the-patients-came-down-with-typhoid-fever-it-was-awful-at-least-100-patients-ended-up-dying"" data-id=""12649540"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Apparently the credit union sits atop land that was once occupied by a psychiatric hospital from the 1930s. It housed nearly 6000 patients and a staff of 760.</a> In 1939, something happened here that would become national news and eventually leave a national radio podcaster and a professional ghost hunting team standing outside a strip mall. Dumont probably believes that she told me it was a credit union and not the infamous Manteno mental hospital. She did not.</p>

<blockquote>EMILY: The hospital closed in 1985. Over on the north campus is a veteran's home, which is very nice. There's a college just back there. This parcel of land was leased to a variety of businesses.</blockquote><p>The building's manager, Walter, was waiting for us inside. The credit union had closed permanently a week earlier, and the space was currently available for lease. The security system was still operational.</p>

<blockquote>WALTER: So this was the security tape from two weeks ago. Place was still open then. As you can see by the timestamp, it's just after midnight.<br>
EMILY: There's no one in the building, not even a janitor or security guard?<br>
WALTER: Not at midnight.<br>
EMILY: And this is when it happened?<br>
WALTER: Yeah. Here, I queued it up… That's what I'm talking about.<br>
EMILY: Interesting.</blockquote><p>Okay. I'm going to describe what I saw on that tape. It was typical security camera footage, camera angled down from a high corner facing the lobby. There was nothing, just a set of doors. Then one of the doors opened. Slowly. By itself.</p>

<blockquote>EMILY: That's not an automatic door?<br>
WALTER: No, ma'am. Here, take a look at the other angle.<br>
EMILY: That's the rear lobby.<br>
WALTER: Same doors, different angle.<br>
EMILY: It's empty.<br>
WALTER: Yes, ma'am.</blockquote><p>Walter showed us the footage from the camera facing the rear lobby. Basically the reverse angle of the other tape. We're seeing both sides simultaneously, and the door just opens. Slowly, by itself. Even now as I'm describing what I saw, I'm getting goose-bumps. We went to examine the door for ourselves. It wasn't automatic. Walter had to leave, so he left us to lock up. An excited Dumont spoke with Donnie and Tina in hushed tones while I stood there, going over every scary thing I'd heard about or imagined about mental health living conditions in the early 20th century.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: So what do you think is going on?<br>
EMILY: Clearly something is present here.<br>
ALEX: Clearly?<br>
EMILY: Well, this door is too heavy to be moved by wind or another force.<br>
<a href=""/12649566/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Alex-do-you-think-it-might-be-supernatural-donnie-definitely-emf-readings-were-off-the-charts"" data-id=""12649566"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">ALEX: Do you think it might be supernatural?<br>
DONNIE: Definitely. EMF readings were off the charts.</a><br>
ALEX: Do you think it might be the ghost of one of the typhoid victims?<br>
EMILY: Well I don't want to jump to conclusions.<br>
ALEX: Of course not.<br>
EMILY: It could be a spirit. What you refer to as a ghost. Maybe a patient. But it could also be a nurse or a doctor. Or it might be a lesser entity; a vortex or portal spirit.<br>
ALEX: Is there any way to find out?<br>
EMILY: There is.<br>
ALEX: How?<br>
EMILY: We ask them.</blockquote><p>And ask them we did, after the break.</p>

<hr><p>The five of us stood in the main room near the door. On his way back from the car with equipment, Donnie claimed to see an apparition - an old man in the credit union window. More about this later.<br>
Donnie set two flashlights on the floor; one with a red gel, one blue. Apparently, this is a common ghost hunting or clairvoyant thing. They were going to talk to the spirit through the lights. Donnie turned on the flashlights and unscrewed the tops just enough to turn them off. The idea being, if the spirit wants to talk, it can touch or push the top of the light and that will turn the light back on. We were standing in the middle of a dark room where a scary old mental hospital once stood. I was getting suitably freaked out.</p>

<blockquote>DONNIE: If I can get everybody to stand around the lights in a circle? Thank you.<br>
TINA: It won't take the spirits much energy to turn the flashlights on and off.</blockquote><p>So, we're all standing there, waiting. There was a small amount of moonlight shining through the window, enough to see the flashlights on the floor and the outlines of everyone. It was quite a mood.</p>

<blockquote>EMILY: My name is Emily Dumont. I'd like to be able to speak with you. Could you turn one of the lights on?<br>
ALEX: And the red light switches on. We were looking right at it. There was clearly nobody touching it. Crazy.<br>
EMILY: Thank you. Please turn it off.<br>
ALEX: And then, after a moment, it was off.<br>
ALEX: And then she told the spirit that she wanted the blue light for yes and the red light for no.<br>
(EMILY: Okay. Now I'd like the blue light to be yes, and the red light to be no. Is this okay with you?)<br>
EMILY: Blue for yes. Red for no.<br>
ALEX: The blue light flashed on, just for a moment. I have to admit it was kind of terrifying.</blockquote><blockquote>NIC: We went over every inch of that place in advance for light switches, for remotes. And we watched Donnie and Tina very closely, they didn't move at all.</blockquote><p>That's my producer, Nic. He was just as freaked out as I was.</p>

<blockquote>NIC: There had to be some explanation. I mean, we had to be over a flight path, or could it be maybe a rumble from an underground pipe?<br>
ALEX: I don't think an underground pipe would explain what happened next.</blockquote><blockquote>ALEX: Oh my god. Was that the door? [Clattering and banging]</blockquote><blockquote>ALEX (laughing): Okay. You want to tell them what happened, Nic?<br>
NIC: Okay, so the batteries died in the Zoom recorder. So I went back to get my phone so I could use that to record instead. I tripped over the case for some ghost hunting equipment and I fell over.<br>
ALEX (laughing): It scared us all a little bit!<br>
NIC: I don't know what they're doing… but those flashlights, they came off and on. And that door opening on its own... That was pretty convincing.</blockquote><p>And just like that, I was officially ghost hunting. Both Dumont and Donnie said that they saw the apparition of an old man walking around the room. Could there be someone or something haunting that credit union? There's still one more twist in the story. I'm Alex Reagan, this is The Black Tapes Podcast, stay with us.</p>

<hr><blockquote>ALEX: Hi!<br>
WOMAN: Hi.<br>
ALEX: How are you?<br>
WOMAN: Great.<br>
ALEX: Good, good. Do you mind if we record this?<br>
WOMAN: What's it for?<br>
ALEX: Oh, sorry (laughs). I'm Alex Reagan, I was a producer on Pacific Northwest Stories for a few years. I still do a bit of work there, but I'm focused on a new project now. It's a podcast about interesting people with interesting jobs.<br>
WOMAN: I love Pacific Northwest Stories. My friend was interviewed for that one that they ended up making into that karate movie.<br>
ALEX: (laughs) Cool! Yeah, I left a few messages for Jenna, is she here?<br>
WOMAN: Have a seat. I'll check.<br>
ALEX: Thank you.</blockquote><p>Jenna Yeats is Richard Strand's publisher. I sat down with her to talk about Strand.</p>

<blockquote>JENNA: How can I help?<br>
ALEX: A half hour sit-down interview with Richard Strand.<br>
JENNA: For the radio?<br>
ALEX: It's a new podcast.<br>
JENNA: You're a producer on Pacific Northwest Stories?<br>
ALEX: Yes. Well, I was. I still help them out every once in a while.<br>
JENNA: We listen, my husband and I, every week.<br>
ALEX: Ahh. So is Dr. Strand available?<br>
JENNA: I'm afraid he's not doing interviews currently.<br>
ALEX: Is there any way you could call him and plead my case?<br>
JENNA: No promises, but I'll see what I can do.<br>
ALEX: Thank you.</blockquote><blockquote>STRAND: Hello, I'm returning one of 11 calls from somebody named... Alex Reagan? It's Richard Strand. Okay, goodbye.</blockquote><p>And so, after dozens of calls, emails, and countless messages, I was finally in a room Dr. Richard Strand.</p>

<hr><blockquote>STRAND: Is this okay?<br>
ALEX: Yeah, anywhere works.<br>
STRAND: What kind of article is this?<br>
ALEX: It's for the radio.<br>
STRAND: People still listen to the radio?<br>
ALEX: It's digital. On demand. Yeah, people do still listen actually.<br>
STRAND: Okay. What do you want to know?</blockquote><p>Dr. Richard Strand is a tall man, good looking, confident, with a perpetual wry smile and cool blue eyes that betray a sharp intelligence. He's a man who doesn't like to waste time or words. And he just looks like he knows something that the rest of us can't quite understand. He has degrees in religion, and mythology, and psychology from Yale. He formally opened the Strand Institute in 1998.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: Well you have degrees in religion and psychology. Did you study the paranormal, parapsychology?<br>
STRAND: They don't offer degrees in those subjects.<br>
ALEX: Why not?<br>
STRAND: As soon as you apply scientific method to the paranormal, it vanishes.<br>
ALEX: Hm. Can you tell me about the Strand Institute?<br>
STRAND: The talking point everyone seems most interested in is the reward.<br>
ALEX: Oh, the one million dollars for any evidence of the supernatural or paranormal?<br>
STRAND: That's correct.<br>
ALEX: Has anybody tried to claim that money?<br>
STRAND: Thousands of them.<br>
ALEX: And?<br>
STRAND: Nobody's even come close.<br>
ALEX: Really?<br>
STRAND: There hasn't been one actual case of anything magical, supernatural, or paranormal ever happening on this planet.<br>
ALEX: Okay, so you're saying unequivocally, that there's no such thing as ghosts.<br>
STRAND: Isn't there enough wonder and beauty in the world without having to invent magical mythical creatures and spirits to enhance it? I understand humanity's need to assuage our fear of mortality. But if we spent half the money we spent on religion on science? We'd have a colony on Mars and we probably would have cured death and aging by now.<br>
ALEX: What are these?</blockquote><p>Dr. Strand has a bookcase filled with hundreds of white VHS cases. For our younger listeners, these are hard plastic cases big enough to hold a VHS tape. Roughly 8 inches by 5 inches. Each one of Strand's tape cases is labelled with a name. Interesting names, like the Poltergeist’s Dinner, The Haunting of Mr. and Mr. Smith, and The Witch of Walmart 5.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: What's in the VHS boxes?<br>
STRAND: Those are solved cases.<br>
ALEX: That's quite a bit since 1998.<br>
STRAND: This is just the last two years.<br>
ALEX: Wow, that's a lot.<br>
STRAND: That's pretty standard for us.<br>
ALEX: And by solved, you mean debunked?<br>
STRAND: That's correct.<br>
ALEX: May I?<br>
STRAND: Go ahead.</blockquote><p>Inside the VHS case was a USB stick, a DVD, a bunch of index cards, and some photographs. The VHS case worked perfectly as compact storage for everything inside. This particular case appeared to involve some kind of UFO or ghost sightings.</p>

<br>
At this point, Dr. Strand shut down our interview, nicely. He was polite and generously offered a follow up call if I had any additional questions. I did have additional questions. Questions based on something I saw in Dr. Strand's equipment room. More on that after the break.</a></p>

<hr><p>I called Dr. Strand a few days later for the follow-up he promised.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: Thanks so much for taking the time.<br>
STRAND: You're welcome.<br>
ALEX: I want to play something on my computer.<br>
STRAND: Over the phone?<br>
ALEX: If that's okay.<br>
STRAND: Fine.<br>

STRAND: … No.<br>
MALE ATTENDEE #1: What about the Sagamore?<br>

<br>
ALEX: What happened in that auditorium?<br>
STRAND: There was a low rumbling sound, and then the lights went out.<br>

STRAND: That's right.<br>
ALEX: You claim that it was a coincidence.<br>
STRAND: It was.<br>
ALEX: What's the Sagamore?<br>
STRAND: It's a hotel, a resort in New York State.<br>
ALEX: And did something happen there?<br>
STRAND: There've been numerous claims of hauntings, including lights flickering and deep rumbling sounds.<br>
ALEX: Were you able to debunk them?<br>
STRAND: … Yes.</a><br>
ALEX: Well, I think we've got everything. But I do have to ask one small favor.<br>
STRAND: Go ahead.<br>
ALEX: My assistant's equipment was stolen and we lost your photo. The one we took for our website. It will only take a few minutes. I'll be in and out, you'll barely notice I'm there.<br>
STRAND: …Fine.</blockquote><p>I wasn't being completely honest with Strand. We did need another photo for the website, but my producers told me we were fine using his standard publicity picture. <a href=""/12644624/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Alex-what-are-these-strand-nothing"" data-id=""12644624"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">What I really wanted to do was get another look at something I saw in his equipment room - a row of numbered black VHS cases. It was when I asked Strand about those tapes that he shut down our interview.</a> I wanted to know more.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: Thanks again for taking the time.<br>
STRAND: No problem at all.<br>
ALEX: I have something I'd like you to look at, if you have a moment. It's a ghost.<br>
STRAND: Really.<br>
ALEX: It's pretty convincing.<br>
STRAND: People are easily convinced.<br>
ALEX: I don't know about that. This is pretty good.</blockquote><p>My ambush worked. Dr. Strand agreed to take a look at the footage from the credit union.</p>

STRAND: Let's say alleged hauntings.<br>
ALEX: It's actually a building located on part of the old hospital site.</a></blockquote><p>I showed Strand the footage of the door mysteriously moving on its own, along with some footage my producer Nic took using his phone. Nic focused his camera on Dumont and her team's use of their highly advanced ghost hunting equipment, the flashlight stuff, the whole deal.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: What do you think?<br>
STRAND: It's an automatic door. A trick switch somewhere.<br>
ALEX: The manager assured us that it wasn't.<br>
STRAND: Mmhmm.<br>
ALEX: Okay, what about Ms. Dumont and her team? They claimed significant indicators of paranormal motion.<br>
STRAND: I'm sure they did. Let's function on their level for a moment.<br>
ALEX: Okay.<br>
STRAND: In purely scientific terms, which is something Emily Dumont knows very little about, <a href=""/12649566/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Alex-do-you-think-it-might-be-supernatural-donnie-definitely-emf-readings-were-off-the-charts"" data-id=""12649566"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">their readings are completely invalid.<br>
ALEX: Why?<br>
STRAND: That guy holding the EMF meter...<br>
ALEX: Donnie.<br>
STRAND: Sure, Donnie. He's moving, he's waving the meter around like a lunatic.<br>
ALEX: So?<br>
STRAND: So, an electromagnetic field meter needs to be set in one place and left alone.</a> Dr. Dumont is getting lazy.<br>
<br>

STRAND: Cell tower locations in the area.<br>
ALEX: And they're significant why?<br>
STRAND: EMF readings are compromised by a high volume of cell phone traffic.<br>
ALEX: Is this a high traffic area?<br>
STRAND: This area is one of the busiest cell tower cross ping zones in the state. You can't trust EMF readings here.</a><br>
ALEX: Mm, what about the door?<br>
STRAND: The most important part of a paranormal investigation is history. The history of people and places. Let's start with places. (typing)<br>
ALEX: What are you looking for?<br>
STRAND: George Crookshank owns the land that used to house the mental hospital.<br>
ALEX: If you say so.</blockquote><p><a href=""/12649600/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Strand-was-like-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-on-that-laptop"" data-id=""12649600"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Strand was like <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i> on that laptop.</a> He was clearly somebody who spent a lot of time researching this kind of stuff. He dug up an article about Mr. Crookshank trying to skirt heritage laws. He wanted to tear down an old house. When they wouldn't let him, he rebelled and turned the place into a haunted house attraction. That house became the haunted mansion of Beale Street. Every Halloween the place was packed. The neighbors gave in and let him tear it down. I guess they didn't like a good ghost story.</p>

<blockquote>STRAND: What if Crookshank was trying to do something similar with the old strip mall?<br>
ALEX: That feels like a bit of a stretch.<br>
STRAND: Maybe, but I found that article along with the EMF readings in 15 minutes.<br>

I was there. There's no way they could have been messing with those lights. They were plain old three dollar flashlights. No high tech chicanery there.</a></p>

Heat. Expansion and contraction. People like Emily Dumont and those reality television ghost hunters use this trick all the time. It's very common. When you turn a flashlight on the bulb gets very hot. Then you unscrew the lid just a little until it turns off. Inside that really hot flashlight is a little bit of plastic that expanded when it was hot. Now that the light is off, that plastic cools and contracts and pushes two little bits of metal together to form a circuit.<br>
ALEX: The light goes on.<br>
STRAND: And when it heats up enough again, off.</a><br>
ALEX: The ghost hunter set us up?<br>
STRAND: Maybe. But in my experience it’s usually just apophenia.<br>
ALEX: Apophenia?<br>
STRAND: They really just want to believe, and to that end they force supernatural meaning into meaningless events and patterns.</blockquote><p>Wow. I couldn't help feeling a bit let down at such a simple logical explanation. With very little effort, Strand cast a great deal of doubt on our haunted credit union. And he wasn't finished.</p>

<blockquote>STRAND: They told you they saw an apparition?<br>
ALEX: An old man.<br>
STRAND: Show them an old photo of somebody's great grandfather. Tell them that he was a patient who died in that room. I'll bet you they tell you they recognize him.</blockquote><p>I was surprised. I didn't want it to be true. But in the interest of getting to the truth, I took his suggestion.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: So, we dug up a photo of a man who died in the east wing of the hospital, right about where you and Donnie saw the apparition.<br>
EMILY: That's him. That's the man I saw.<br>
ALEX: Are you sure?<br>
EMILY: Positive. I'd recognize him anywhere.</blockquote><p>Dr. Strand was right. I did have more questions about the mysterious credit union door, but I wanted to steer the conversation in a different direction. The mysterious black tape cases in that back room.</p>

Pretty standard stuff. No bouncy castles or magicians and certainly no scary clowns. But I should back up a bit. <a href=""/12644624/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Alex-what-are-these-strand-nothing"" data-id=""12644624"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Dr. Strand eventually agreed to let me take a look at one of the unsolved, he would say say ‘unsolved yet’, cases from that mysterious row of plastic black VHS containers that I'm going to refer to as the black tapes from this point forward. And yes, this is how we came up with the name of our podcast. It looks like there were around a dozen or so VHS cases on that shelf.</a> This birthday party is from what we're calling tape number one.</p>

<blockquote>[Children laughing, talking]<br>
ALEX: So what are we looking at here?<br>
STRAND: It's coming up. There.<br>
ALEX: What is that?<br>
STRAND: What do you see?</blockquote><p>It's a man. More specifically, the shadow of a man. Sort of. It's a dark shadow in the background. It's standing right next to an old shed by a wire fence. It looks like a tall man wearing a hat, but it's proportions are all… wrong. It's impossibly thin. It could almost be mistaken for the shadow of a tree if it didn't look like it had arms and legs. <a href=""/12649281/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Im-looking-at-old-super-8-footage-of-a-boys-birthday-party"" data-id=""12649281"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">But it's hard to tell, it's pretty grainy.</a></p>

<blockquote>ALEX: Okay, it's a shadow of, maybe, a man. Or a really weird looking tree?<br>
STRAND: (laughs)<br>
ALEX: What am I looking for now?<br>
STRAND: You'll see.<br>
(Wedding vows being read)</blockquote><p>Okay, it's the same videotape, but a completely different scene. Different people altogether. It looks fairly contemporary, like it could have been shot in the last few years.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: Okay, so I'm supposed to see something right?<br>
STRAND: Yes. Do you see it?<br>
<a href=""/12649318/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Alex-its-like-wheres-waldo-is-it-in-the-foreground-background-in-the-pews-where-am-i-looking"" data-id=""12649318"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">ALEX: It's like <i>Where's Waldo</i>. Is it in the foreground, background, in the pews? Where am I looking?</a><br>
STRAND: By the organist.<br>
ALEX: By the organist... okay. Uh… Oh my god.</blockquote><p>Okay, that shadowy figure I just described in that kid’s birthday party? It was there by the stage in the church, behind the organist. It had the tall skinny outline, the hat. And I swear, this time I could see something like fingers. But maybe not? They were as long as my forearms. I don't know, but whatever it was, it looked creepy as hell.</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: So what? People send you tapes of these shadow things?<br>
STRAND: Not quite. This is the wedding of Robert Torres. He lives in San Francisco, where they got married three years ago as you just saw.<br>
ALEX: Okay.<br>
STRAND: That boy in the first section lived in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that tape was from his fifth birthday party. That was about forty years ago.<br>
ALEX: Okay.<br>
STRAND: The boy's name is Bobby.<br>
ALEX: So...<br>
STRAND: Bobby Torres.<br>
ALEX: Bobby is Robert Torres.<br>
STRAND: Yes.<br>
ALEX: So that shadow thing is?<br>
STRAND: Whatever it is, it was there when Robert was 5. And it appears to be there again when Robert's 42.<br>
ALEX: It's following him?<br>
STRAND: I'm not comfortable speculating.</blockquote><p>My producer Nic and I discussed it, and we're sure we have at least another episode worth of material with Richard Strand. <a href=""/12649356/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/So-in-lieu-of-our-original-second-episode-which-was-going-to-feature-me-digging-into-the-fascinating-and-occasionally-dangerous-world-of-geocaching"" data-id=""12649356"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">So in lieu of our original second episode, which was going to feature me digging into the fascinating and occasionally dangerous world of geocaching</a>, we're going to finish up our story on Richard Strand and <a href=""/12644624/The-black-tapes-podcast-a-tale-of-two-tapes-part-i/Alex-what-are-these-strand-nothing"" data-id=""12644624"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">his mysterious black tapes</a>.<br>
<br>
I'm starting to believe there are a lot of things in this world that I just don't understand. Why would somebody spend so much time and effort - and probably a lot of money - to create a sophisticated fake child's birthday party film and then repeat the feat decades later at his wedding? Is it Torres himself? If so, why? And who is it for?</p>

<hr><p>Next week, on the Black Tapes podcast:</p>

<blockquote>ALEX: Okay, I do understand what you're saying of course, but... I don't know. I just don't feel like... I crossed a line.<br>
Nic: No?<br>
ALEX: No! I don't think so. Do you think so?<br>
<br>
ALEX: You must be Sebastian.<br>
SEBASTIAN: Are you fighting with my mom?<br>
ALEX: Did it sound like we were fighting? We weren't. We were just talking about something very important, so our voices may have sounded worried. But we're fine.<br>
SEBASTIAN: I know what you're talking about.<br>
ALEX: You do?<br>
SEBASTIAN: You're talking about my friend.<br>
ALEX: What friend?<br>
SEBASTIAN: Why are you following him?<br>
ALEX: Who says I'm following him?<br>
SEBASTIAN: He says you don't want to meet him.</blockquote><hr><p>More on this, along with a lot more on Strand's mysterious black tapes, next week.<br>

[Verso 2]<br>
Shorty, la nota explota (Ey)<br>
Yo no sé qué pasaba<br>
Tuve que agarrarme de ti fuerte (Ah)<br>
A ver hasta dónde llegaba<br>
Shorty, fue la nota (Tra, tra)<br>
To'a la noche, pero yo no me quitaba<br>
Sorry si yo nunca me envuelvo (Tra, tra, tra)<br>
Pero tú 'tás complicada (¡Yah!)<br>

"<p><b>Tale of King Omar Bin Al-Nu'uman and His Sons Sharrkan and Zau Al-Makan</b><br>
<br>
And What Befel Them of Things Seld-Seen and Peregrine.[FN#138]<br>
<br>
The King asked her, ""And what was their story?"" and she answered: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was in the City of Safety, Baghdad, before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwán,[FN#139] a King, Omar bin al-Nu'umán highs, who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the Chosroës of Persia and the Kaysars of Eastern Rome; for none could warm himself at his fire;[FN#140] nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame. He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin,[FN#141] the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diyár Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sudán, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayhún and Jayhún,[FN#142] Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan,[FN#143] who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. This Prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected His servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year;[FN#144] and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, ""Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!"" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, ""Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:"" so quoth he to himself, ""If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:"" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia,[FN#145] whom the King of Roum and Lord of Cæsarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, ""O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing""[FN#146]—a speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool.[FN#147] Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, ""Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb."" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy.[FN#148] The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Makán and his sister Nuzhat al-Zamán.[FN#149] They answered ""Hearing and obedience,"" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, ""O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest."" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, ""O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afrídún,[FN#150] Lord of Ionia land[FN#151] and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander,[FN#152] whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail.[FN#153] When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,—whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth[FN#154] against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia[FN#155] in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance."" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Forty-sixth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan[FN#156] highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, ""O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money."" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, ""Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle."" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-à-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, ""Ye have delay of three days."" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city;[FN#157] and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money.[FN#158] Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, ""I hear and I obey;"" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady.[FN#159] As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets[FN#160] which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, ""Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle[FN#161]!"" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,<br>
<br>
""Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters<br>
            course through plain and wood:<br>
No work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all<br>
            gifts, Giver of all good!""<br>
<br>
And as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon.[FN#162] Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,<br>
<br>
""The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens<br>
            debonnair:<br>
Double its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-<br>
           fair:<br>
Virgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to<br>
            ensnare;<br>
And like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of<br>
            their hair:<br>
Shooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond<br>
          compare;<br>
Overpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire.""<br>
<br>
Sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,<br>
<br>
""She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her<br>
            straight slender stature enshamed the lance:<br>
She burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of<br>
            beauties have habitance:<br>
And the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence<br>
            issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.""<br>
<br>
Then Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, ""Come ye on, that I may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!"" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, ""O strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? Behold I am an old woman, yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of? But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!"" The young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, ""O my lady Zat al-Dawahi,[FN#163] by the truth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?""; and she answered, ""Yea,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Forty-seventh Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, ""By the truth of the Messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?"", and she answered, ""Yea, I will wrestle with thee in very deed"" (Sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, ""Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do."" When the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog.[FN#164] Then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, ""Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked, Mistress whore!""[FN#165] So she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake. With this she inclined towards the damsel and said, ""Do thou as I have done."" All this time, Sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of Yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. Then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam. Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts[FN#166] one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven. Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, ""He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities! Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others."" So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. Then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, ""O my lady Zat al- Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!"" She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. Quoth Sharrkan to himself, ""Every luck hath its cause. Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me."" So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled[FN#167] him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, ""Allah is All mighty[FN#168]!"" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side,[FN#169] where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, ""Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going? Speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights.[FN#170] So tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so."" When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, ""I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them."" Quoth she, ""I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by Allah, they shall never be thy spoil. Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile?"" Quoth he, ""The wise man is he who taketh warning by others."" Thereupon quoth she, ""By the truth of the Messiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger. So, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I and thou. If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee."" Answered Sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, ""Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions""); ""Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, I have money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!"" Rejoined the damsel, ""I am content herewith!"" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, ""And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and keep!) I too am content on the other part!"" Then said she, ""Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al- Islam."" Sharrkan replied, ""By Allah! were a Kazi to swear me, even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis,[FN#171] he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!"" Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, ""Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water!""[FN#172] Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, ""Cross the stream to me;"" but she replied, ""It is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me."" ""I cannot do that,"" quoth he, and quoth she, ""O boy, I will come across to thee."" So she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms.[FN#173] But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, ""O Moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,"" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it. Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale. So she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. Then she asked him, ""O Moslem! the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?""; and he answered, ""O my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!"" ""As it was thus revealed to your Prophet,"" she replied, ""it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. I give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous."" Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, ""Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kings against Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?"" ""'Twas not for lack of strength in me,"" he answered; ""nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy."" She laughed and said, ""I grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right I should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long."" Then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, ""Get ye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longing for you."" So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. He fell on his back,[FN#174] and then she said to him, ""Rise: I give thee thy life a second time. I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee, if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman to succour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh Lite,[FN#175] the jostle and the leg-lock."" ""By Allah, O my lady,"" quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), ""had I been Master al-Safdí, Master Mohammed Kimál or Ibn al-Saddí,[FN#176] as they were in their prime, I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover I have regained my presence of mind."" When she heard his words she said to him, ""Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, O vanquished one? However come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round."" Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise, setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him, ""O Moslem, thou art now on thy mettle."" ""Yes,"" he replied, ""thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of us will wend a different way."" She laughed and he laughed too;[FN#177] then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back. She laughed at him and said, ""Art thou an eater of bran? Thou are like a Badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the Father of Winds[FN#178] that droppeth before a puff of air. Fie upon thee, O thou poor thing!"" adding, ""Get thee back to the Moslem army and send us other than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim for us, among the Arabs and Persians, the Turks and Daylamites,[FN#179] whoso hath might in him, let him come to us."" Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sharrkan, laughing, ""Parting with thee is right grievous to me, O my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn, lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points. Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and Knights?"" Sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as she turned from him making towards the convent), ""O my lady, wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken hearted slave of love?"" So she turned to him laughing and said, ""What is thy want? I will grant thee thy prayer."" ""Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy,"" replied he, ""and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality; I who have become one of thy servitors!"" ""None baulk kindliness save the base,"" she rejoined, ""honour us in Allah's name, on my head and eyes be it! Mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art my guest."" At this Sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to his horse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge[FN#180] built of beams of the white poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks. When Sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one in the Greek tongue, ""Arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent."" So she went up to Sharrkan and led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw, and saying to himself, ""O would that the Wazir Dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours."" Then he turned to the young lady and said to her, ""O marvel of loveliness, now I have two claims upon thee; first the claim of good fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality. I am now under thy commandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of Al-Islam; where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am."" When she heard this she was angered and said to him, ""By the truth of the Messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit; but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart, and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent. How should I do as thou sayest, when I wot that if I came to that King of yours, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, I should never get free from him? For truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, Lord of Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be, who hath built for himself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year, and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if I come to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe I am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'Or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.'[FN#181] So how canst thou speak thus to me? As for thy saying, 'Thou shalt look upon the braves of the Moslems,' by the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for I saw your army when it reached our land, these two days ago; and I did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings, but I beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together. And as to thy words, 'Thou shalt know who I am,' I did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou Sharrkan, Omar bin al- Nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!"" ""Knowest thou Sharrkan?"" asked he; and she answered Yes! and I know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen; also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the King of Constantinople."" ""O my lady,"" said Sharrkan, ""I adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause of all this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and with whom the fault lies."" ""Now by the virtue of thy faith,"" she replied, ""did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that I am of the daughters of Roum, I would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader, the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their champion Sharrkan.[FN#182] Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby, for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the Arabs. But I have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women. Nor, indeed, had Sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him, 'Clear this stream,' could he have done it; and I only long and lust that the Messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, that I might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes.""- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Forty-eighth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Nazarene damsel said to Sharrkan (and he listening impatiently enow), ""Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands, I would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes,"" pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,<br>
<br>
""An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove, * Her charms a thousand advocates shall move.""<br>
<br>
So she went up and Sharrkan after her; and, when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other, like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:- -<br>
<br>
""For her sins is a pleader that brow, * And all hearts its fair<br>
             pleading must bow:<br>
When I saw it I cried, ""To night * The moon at its fullest doth<br>
            show;<br>
Tho' Balkis' own Ifrit[FN#183] try a bout, * Spite his force she<br>
            would deal him a throw.""<br>
<br>
The two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway. This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire. The handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems,[FN#184] and went on before her (Sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold. The monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence the water ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for Kings. Then said the damsel, ""Ascend, O my lord, this throne."" So he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him, ""She hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even as she ordered."" So they set before him viands of rare varieties, and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands. Then his thoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case, repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated,<br>
<br>
""I am not lost to prudence, but indeed * Here I'm bewildered,<br>
            what shall be my rede?<br>
Would any aid me in mine ails of love, * By my own might and<br>
            sleight would I be free'd:<br>
But ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * To none save Allah<br>
          can I trust my need!""<br>
<br>
When he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare show and a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her. She was clad in brocades befitting Kings; her breasts were like twin pomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal[FN#185] supporting a silvern shaft. When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and Wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems. Handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead. He sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud, ""Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!"" and broke out into these couplets,<br>
<br>
""With heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * And lissome form<br>
           that sways with swimming gait<br>
She deftly hides love longing in her breast; * But I may never<br>
           hide its ban and bate<br>
While hosts of followers her steps precede,[FN#186] * Like pearls<br>
            now necklaced and now separate.""<br>
<br>
She gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him, when she came up to him and said, ""In very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, O Sharrkan! How sped thy night, O hero, after we went away and left thee?""; adding, ""Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especially in great Kings! and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan, son and heir of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite. And as thou art pierced by the shaft of Fate, be resignation thine and abide content to wait."" When he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, ""I am Sharrkan, bin Omar bin al-Nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in my case!"" She hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned to him and said, ""Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear;[FN#187] for thou art the guest of my hospitality, and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard. Have no fear for, by the truth of the Messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thy sake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and of me."" Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him, she would have done so during the past night. Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slave girls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food; but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself, ""Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat."" She knew what was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, ""By the truth of the Messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest! Had my mind been set on slaying thee, I had slain thee ere now."" Then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon Sharrkan came forward and ate too. She was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied. They washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-service with vessels of gold, silver and crystal. She filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as she had done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed it to him. He drank and she said to him, ""O Moslem, see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life!"" And she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Forty-ninth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her. Presently she said to the slave girl, ""O Marjanah[FN#188]! bring us some instruments of music!"" ""To hear is to obey,"" said the hand maid and going out, returned in the twinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute,[FN#189] a Persian harp, a Tartar pipe, and an Egyptian dulcimer. The young lady took the lute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentle undersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than Tasmin[FN#190] spring, with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following,<br>
<br>
""Allah assain those eyne! What streams of blood they shed! * How<br>
           many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped.<br>
I love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'Twere wrong to<br>
           rue the love in wrong head born and bred:<br>
Haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * Heaven help<br>
          the hapless heart by force of thee misled!<br>
Thou doomest me to death who art my king, and I * Ransom with<br>
          life the deemster who would doom me dead.""<br>
<br>
Thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument, played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue; then their mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies asked him, ""O Moslem, dost thou understand what I say?""; and he answered, ""Nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips."" She laughed and continued, ""If I sing to thee in Arabic what wouldst thou do?"" ""I should no longer,"" quoth he, ""be master of my senses."" Then she took an instrument and, changing the measure, began singing these verses,<br>
<br>
""The smack of parting's myrrh to me, * How, then, bear patience'<br>
            aloë?<br>
I'm girt by ills in trinity * Severance, distance,<br>
             cruelty!<br>
My freedom stole that fairest she, * And parting irks me<br>
            bitterly.""<br>
<br>
When she ended her verse, she looked at Sharrkan and found him lost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens.[FN#191] Then he revived and, remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; and the twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued their playing and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing. Then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her they answered, ""She is gone to her sleeping chamber,"" whereto he rejoined, ""Under Allah's ward and His good guard!"" As soon as it was morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, ""My mistress biddeth thee to her."" So he rose and followed her and, as he drew near her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels. Thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams. About the saloon were figures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke.[FN#192] Here sat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she saw Sharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand, made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passed the night. He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him, ""Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love?""; and he answered ""Yes! I wot somewhat in verse on that matter."" ""Let me hear it,"" quoth she, so he began quoting,<br>
<br>
""Pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * To Azzah,<br>
           freest with our name and fame!<br>
By Allah! would I near her off she flies * At tangent, granting<br>
           less the more I claim:<br>
I dote on Azzah, but when clear I off * My rivals, clears me too<br>
           that dearest dame;<br>
Like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * Which, ere<br>
            siesta done, thin air became.""<br>
<br>
When she heard this she said, ""Verily Al-Kuthayyir[FN#193] was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlative in his praise of Azzah when he sang"" (and she began to recite),<br>
<br>
""Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o' noon, * The judge had judged her<br>
             beauty's bestest boon;<br>
And girls who come to me and carp at her, * God make their rosy<br>
           cheeks her sandal-shoon!<br>
<br>
And indeed,"" quoth she, ""'twas said that Azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness."" Then she asked Sharrkan saying, ""O Prince, cost thou know aught of Jamil's[FN#194] verses to Buthaynah? if so repeat to us somewhat of them;"" and he answered, ""Yes, I know them better than any;"" whereupon he began repeating these couplets,<br>
<br>
""Jamil, in Holy war go fight!"" to me they say: * What war save<br>
            fight for fair ones would I e'er essay?<br>
To me their every word and work are mere delight, * And martyrs<br>
           crepe I all they slay in fight and fray:<br>
An ask I, 'O Buthaynah! what's this love, I pray, * Which eats<br>
            my heart?' quoth she ' 'Twill stay for ever and aye!'<br>
And when I cry, 'Of wits return some small display * For daily<br>
            use,' quoth she, 'Far, far 'tis fled away!<br>
Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * While I<br>
             no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'""<br>
<br>
""Thou hast spoken right well,"" said she, ""O King's son, and Jamil also spoke excellently well. But what would Buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich,<br>
<br>
'Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'""<br>
<br>
""O my lady,"" quoth Sharrkan, ""she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee."" She laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till Day put out her light and Night came in darkness dight. Then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept, while Sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned. As soon as he awoke, the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, ""Bismillah! in Allah's name be so kind as to come[FN#195]: our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!"" So he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playing on tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passing all description. Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting,<br>
<br>
""He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * And her breast-<br>
           pearls that bedded in gold mine lie.<br>
Pure water on silvern bars is her brow, * And her cheeks show<br>
             roses with rubies vie:<br>
Meseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * Lies purpling set in<br>
            the Ithmid's[FN#196] dye.""<br>
When the lady saw Sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and,<br>
taking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, ""O son of King<br>
Omar bin al-Nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?""<br>
""Yes,"" he answered, ""but do not thou with me as said the poet,<br>
'I speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * Till with<br>
             her honey dew of inner lip she plies me:<br>
I brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * With<br>
            white and black,[FN#197] but black cum white ne'er satisfies<br>
             me:<br>
'Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me * Till wilful<br>
             loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me:<br>
And if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * Oh man! that<br>
             glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'""<br>
<br>
Then she brought the chessboard and played with him; but Sharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at her fair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant[FN#198] instead of knight. She laughed and said to him, ""If thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of the game."" ""This is only our first,"" replied he, ""judge not by this bout."" When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, a fourth and a fifth. So she turned to him and said, ""Thou art beaten in everything;"" and he replied, ""O my lady, how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten?"" Then she bade bring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which the wine was set before them and they drank. Presently, she took the dulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets,<br>
<br>
""Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth, *<br>
            Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness<br>
             showeth.<br>
Then drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost<br>
             find her * Anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good<br>
             forth goeth.""<br>
<br>
They ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first. When darkness set in, the lady betook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the hand maids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn, when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom. Seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, who came to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by her side. Then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised,<br>
<br>
""Ne'er incline thee to part * Which embitters the heart<br>
E'en the sun when he sets * Shall in pallor depart.""<br>
<br>
While they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold, there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue ""Thou hast fallen into our hands, O Sharrkan, so make thee sure of death!"" When he heard this, he said to himself, ""By Allah, she hath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. These are the Knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis I who have thrown myself into this strait."" Then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd, ""Who are ye?"" ""O most gracious Princess and peerless onion pearl,"" answered the leading Knight, ""dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side?"" ""Not I,"" she replied, ""who may he be?"" Quoth the Patrician, ""This is of towns the highwayman! This is he who rideth in the horseman's van! This is Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman! This is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place! The news of him reached King Hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame Zat al- Dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by taking captive this ominous lion."" When she heard this, she looked at the Knight and asked him, ""What be thy name?"" and he answered, ""I am Másúrah, son of thy slave Mausúrah bin Káshardah, Knight of Knights."" ""And how?"" quoth she, ""durst thou enter my presence without leave?"" Quoth he, ""O my lady, when I came to the gate, none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when others come, they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them. But this is not a time for long talking, when the King is expecting our return with this Prince, the scorpion sting[FN#199] of the Islamitic host, that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came, without the bane of battling with them."" ""These words be ill words,"" rejoined the Princess, ""and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest. So even were we assured that this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt, I say it would ill befit mine honour that I should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection. So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men; but return to the King, my father, and kiss the ground before him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the Lady Zat al-Dawahi."" ""O Abrízah,"" replied Masurah, the Knight, ""I cannot return to the King's majesty without his debtor and enemy."" Quoth she (and indeed she had waxed very wroth). ""Out on thee! Return to him with my answer, and no blame shall befal thee!"" Quoth Masurah, ""I will not return without him."" Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed, ""Exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had not come in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders; and if I said to him, 'Thou art Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,' he would answer, 'Yes.' But 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place. Behold, here he is by my side, and I will bring him before you sword and targe in hand."" ""Albeit I were safe from thy wrath,"" answered Masurah the Knight, ""I am not safe from that of thy father, and when I see him, I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive, and we will carry him to the King bound and in abject sort."" When she heard this, she said, ""The matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould be blazoning mere folly. This man is but one and ye are an hundred Knights: so if you would attack him come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant amongst you.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fiftieth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the Knight, ""This man is but one, and ye are an hundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant."" Quoth Masurah, the Knight, ""By the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest sooth, and none but I shall sally out against him first."" Quoth she, ""Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make. If he consent, 'tis well; but if he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for I and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom."" So she went to Sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the Emirs; but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the report reached the King, against her wish and intent. So he again began reproaching himself and said, ""How came I to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the Greeks?"" But hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her, ""Indeed their onset, one after one, would be overburdensome to them. Will they not come out against me, ten by ten?"" ""That would be villainy,"" said she; ""Let one have at one."" When he heard this, he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; and Masurah, the Knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut[FN#200] which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels. When the lady beheld that swashingblow, Sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness. So she turned to the Knights and said, ""Take wreak for your chief!"" Thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furious Knight, and rushed upon Sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals. Then cried the Princess, ""O ye servants of the Messiah, avenge your comrade!"" So they ceased not charging down upon him, one after one; and Sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty Knights, the lady looking on the while. And Allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled,[FN#201] till he had driven sense and soul out of them. Then the Princess called aloud to her damsels, saying, ""Who is left in the convent?""; and they replied, ""None but the gate keepers;"" whereupon she went up to Sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, and they returned to the palace, after he had made an end of the melee. Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery, and when the Princess saw this she rose from Sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine Indian scymitar. And she said, ""Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest; nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the Greeks."" Then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights, and other twenty had taken to flight.[FN#202] When she saw what work he had made with them she said to him, ""Allah bless thee, O Sharrkan! The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee."" Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets,<br>
<br>
""How oft in the mellay I've cleft the array, * And given their<br>
             bravest to lions a prey:<br>
Ask of me and of them when I proved me prow * O'er creation, on<br>
             days of the foray and fray:<br>
When I left in the onslaught their lions to lie * On the sands of<br>
             the low lands[FN#203] in fieriest day.""<br>
<br>
When he ended his verse, the Princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her, ""O lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand?"" ""To guard thee against these caitiffs,""[FN#204] she replied. Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them, ""How came ye to admit the King's Knights into my dwelling without leave of me?""; and they answered, ""O Princess, it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the King's messengers, and especially for the chief of his Knights."" Quoth she, ""I think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;"" and bade Sharrkan smite their necks. He did so and she cried to the rest of her servants, ""Of a truth, they deserved even more than that!"" Then turning to Sharrkan, she said to him, ""Now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be made acquainted with my history. Know, then, that I am the daughter of King Hardub of Roum; my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame, yclept Zat al-Dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side. She it certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that I have separated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no better than I should be with the Moslems. Wherefore it were wiser that I leave this dwelling while Zat al-Dawahi is on my track; but I require of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee, for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account. So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say to thee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee."" Hearing her words, Sharrkan joyed greatly; his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said, ""By Allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people?"" ""Even so,"" she answered; and Sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth. Then said she, ""Now is my heart at ease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee."" ""What is it?"" asked he and she answered, ""It is that thou return with thy host to thine own country."" Quoth he, ""O lady mine, my father, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, on account of the treasure he plundered from the King of Constantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, noted givers of good fortune."" Quoth she, ""Cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes: I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the King of Constantinople. Know that we have a yearly festival, highs the Convent Feast, whereat Kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families, and the visitors abide there seven days. I was wont to be one of them; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. One year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter of the King of Constantinople, a beautiful girl called Sophia. They tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways;[FN#205] but Sophia said, 'I will not return to Constantinople save by water.' So they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put out to sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till, as Fate and Fortune would have it, she fell in with a Nazarene craft from the Camphor Island[FN#206] carrying a crew of five hundred armed Franks, who had been cruising about a long time. When they sighted the sails of the ship, wherein Sophia and her women were, they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her. Then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast. Thereupon we sallied forth and, looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate,[FN#207] boarded and took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck, wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens, amongst whom was the King's daughter, Sophia. After the capture we carried the Princess and her women to my father, not knowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople; and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided the rest among his dependents. Presently he set apart five damsels, amongst whom was the King s daughter, and sent them to thy father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, together with other gifts, such as broadcloth[FN#208] and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks. Thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls Sophia, daughter of King Afridun; nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him with menaces and saying to him: Two years ago, you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in which was my daughter, Sophia, attended by her maidens numbering some threescore. Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise; nor could I make the matter public, lest reproach befal me amongst the Kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. So I concealed my case till this year, when I wrote to certain Frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kings of the Isles. They replied, 'By Allah we carried her not forth of thy realm; but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her from certain pirates. And they told me the whole tale.' Then he added in the writing which he writ to my father: 'Except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send my daughter back to me. But if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment, I will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices.'[FN#209] When my father read this letter and understood the contents,[FN#210] it vexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia, King Afridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he might have sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about the case because, after so long a time, he could not send to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially as he had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe by this Sophia. So when we pondered that truth, we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun, making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin al Nu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her. When my father's reply reached King Afridun he rose up and sat down,[FN#211] and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:—'What! shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to Kings, and they lie with her without marriage contract? By the Messiah and the true Faith,' said he, 'I will not desist till I have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame; and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me!' So he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassy to thy father, King Omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard: accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to King Afridun, whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot. As for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word in that matter, for they were with Sophia, his daughter; and my father took them from her, when he got possession of her and of her maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are now with me. So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of the Greeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation. I know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them, because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do."" When Sharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; then he kissed Princess Abrizah's hand and said, ""Praise be to Allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me! But 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will become of thee after my departure."" ""Go now to thine army,"" she replied, ""and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country. If the envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them, that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days, I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together."" As he turned to depart she said, ""Forget not the compact which is between me and thee,"" then she rose to bid[FN#212] him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leave of him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceeding weeping, and repeated these verses,<br>
<br>
""I bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * The while my<br>
             left hand held her in a close embrace:<br>
'Fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?' I answered 'Nay, *<br>
             The lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'""<br>
<br>
Then Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent. They brought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow. As soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold, it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs. When they saw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked the reason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and Princess Abrizah from first to last. The Wazir returned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety and said,[FN#213] ""Let us at once leave these lands; for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach, and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners."" So Sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they did and, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay. The Ambassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan's approach to their King, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him. But Sharrkan, escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the two Emirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry ""March! March!"" They took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faring for five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley, where they rested awhile. Then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country. Here, deeming themselves safe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts. They tarried there two days after which, as all would be making for their homes, Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan in command, bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad. But he himself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest of the army had made one day's march: then he called ""To horse!"" and mounted with his hundred men. They rode on two parasangs'[FN#214] space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo! there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust. So they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers, lion faced and in mail coats cased. As soon as they drew within earshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying, ""By the virtue of John and Mary, we have won to our wish! We have been following you by forced marches, night and day, till we forewent you to this place. So dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives."" When Sharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'How is it, O. Nazarene dogs, ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land? And doth not this suffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech? Do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country?"" Then he shouted to his hundred horsemen, ""Up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!"" So saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his, but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wight dashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hot waxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not to charge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack and hew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight. Then they drew apart and Sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurts but not death hurts. Said he to them, ""By Allah, my life long have I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many a gallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights!"" ""Know, O King,"" said they, that there is among them a Frankish cavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust: but, by Allah, he spares us great and small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him. By Allah, had he willed he had killed us all."" Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight had done and such high report of him, so he said, ""When the morn shall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are an hundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them from the Lord of the Heavens."" So they rested that night in such intent; whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said, ""Verily this day we did not win our will of these;"" and he replied, ""At early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will draw out and challenge them, one after one."" They also rested in that mind, and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent the light of day dawn. Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they found the Franks ranged in line of battle; and Sharrkan said to his followers, ""Our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir; so up and at them and lay on load."" Then came forth an Herald of the Franks and cried out, saying, ""Let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, a champion of yours against a champion of ours."" Whereupon one of Sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying, ""Ho! who is for smiting? Let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling!"" Hardly had he made an end of his vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier, armed cap-à-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on a grey white steed,[FN#215] and he had no hair on his cheeks. He urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long before the Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point; and, toppling him from his steed, took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen. His folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbidding him to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whom sallied out another Moslem, brother to the captive, and offered him battle. The two fell to, either against other, and fought for a little while, till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and, falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner. After this fashion the Moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and the Franks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted. Now they had captured of the Moslems twenty cavaliers, and when Sharrken saw this, it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, ""What is this thing that hath befallen us? To- morrow, I myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band. If he persist, we will punish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him."" They righted on this wise till Allah Almighty caused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain; and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain, but behold, more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached the midst of the battle plain. Sharrken looked at that horseman and lo! he was their chief. He was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks. He hent in hand an Indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow, like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when, signing to the Moslems, he cried out in fluent Arab speech ""Ho, Sharrkan! Ho, son of Omar bin al- Nu'uman! Ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries! up and out to battle bout, and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine; and whoso overcometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and come under his sway."" Hardly had he ended his speech, when out came Sharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into the midst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the Frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors. Then they fell to foining and hewing, and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened. Then they drew apart and each returned to his own party; but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, he said, ""Never looked I on the like of this cavalier: he hath one quality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance-heel! In very deed I know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men."" Then he went to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, the Frank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where Sharrkan met him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left and right; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light. Then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp, where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello; and at last the Frank said to his men, ""Tomorrow shall decide the matter!"" So they both passed that night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done. Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse; first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereupon Sharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when the Frank cried out to him, ""O Sharrkan, champions are not wont to do thus! This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman.""[FN#216] When Sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes to the Frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in him Princess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and, kissing the earth before her, asked her, ""What moved thee to a deed like this?""; and she answered, ""I desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. These that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all clean maids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat."" Sharrkan smiled at her speech and said, ""Praise be to Allah for safety and for my reunion with thee, O Queen of the age!"" Then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan's troop and dismount. They did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and Sharrkan who said to them, ""It is the like of you that Kings keep in store for the need hour."" Then he signed to his comrades to salute the Princess; so all alighted and kissed the earth before her, for they knew the story. After this, the whole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for six days' space, till they drew near to Baghdad, when they halted and Sharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garb that was on them,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-first Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan bade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of Greece; and thus did they. Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdad to acquaint his father Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah, daughter of King Hardub, Lord of Graecia-land. They halted forthright in the place they had reached, and Sharrkan also halted and all righted there; and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn, Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city; when lo! on the way they met the Wazir Dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah and Sharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al- Nu'uman. When the two drew near, they turned towards them and kissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace. Sharrkan walked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case. So he told him all that Abrizah had told him, and what had passed between them and said, ""She hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us; and indeed,"" he said to his father, ""the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief, because of his daughter Sophia, for that the King of Greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee; and he (the Grecian King) not knowing her to be daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople; and, had he known that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but he would have restored her to her parent. And of a verity,"" he continued, ""we were saved from these perils only by the Lady Abrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she."" And he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting. When King Omar heard the story of Sharrkan, Abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longed to see her and question her. Thereupon Sharrkan went out to her and said, ""The King calleth for thee;"" she replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who was seated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers, was attended only by his eunuchs. The Princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choice terms. He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated. So she sat down and unveiled her face;[FN#217] and, when the King saw her beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and she answered, ""Here be they with me, O King of the age!"" So saying, she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold. She opened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed them and gave them to the King. Then she went away bearing his heart with her. After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of the other two replied, ""O my son! I mean to give one to thy brother Zau al-Makan, and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al- Zaman."" But when Sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time he knew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him, ""O King, hast thou a son other than myself?"" He answered, ""Yes, and he is now six years old;"" adding that his name was Zau al- Makan and that he and Nuzhat al-Zaman were twins, born at a birth. This news was grievous to Sharrkan, but he kept his secret and said, ""The bless- ing of Allah Most High be upon them!"", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes. Quoth the King, ""How do I see thee change thy manner when hearing of this, considering that after me thou becomes"" heir of the kingdom. Of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine."" Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away, knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed not walking till he had entered Abrizah's palace. As he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire. Then she sat down and seated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her that Allah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia, a boy and a girl, and that he had named the boy Zau al-Makan and the girl Nuzhat al-Zaman; adding, ""He hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine, so I left it behind; I knew naught of Zau al-Makan's birth till this day, and the twain are now six years old. So when I learnt this, wrath possessed me; and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee. But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife, for he loveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee: so what wilt thou say, if he wish this?"" Quoth she, ""Know, O Sharrkan, that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have me without my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, I will take my own life. As for the three jewels, it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and I had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price; but now I desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou have accepted it."" ""Hearkening and obedience,"" replied Sharrkan, and gave it to her. Then said she, ""Fear nothing,"" and talked with him awhile and continued, ""I fear lest my father hear that I am with you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do his endeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself with King Afridun, on account of his daughter Sophia, and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil."" When Sharrken heard these words, he said to her, ""O my lady, if it please thee to sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea."" "" 'Tis well,"" rejoined she; ""if ye entreat me fair, I will tarry with you, and if ye deal evilly by me, I will depart from you."" Then she bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables, and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house, disturbed and perturbed. Such was his case; but regarding the affairs of his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, after dismissing his son Sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betook himself to the Lady Sophia, who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated. Presently, his two children, Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman, came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands. Then went they to their mother, who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life; so he asked her, ""Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, that I might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank?"" ""O King,"" answered Sophia, ""and what could I desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee, overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits? And, furthermore, Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, a son and a daughter."" Her reply pleased the King and after leaving her, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace. Moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment. And presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among the lieges. So far concerning him and Sophia and her children; but in the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and every night, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, ""O King of the age! I have no desire for men at this present."" When he saw her withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned his Wazir Dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of his love for Princess Abrizah, daughter of Hardub, and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her. The Wazir, hearing these words, said to the King, ""As soon as it is dark night, take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal, about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her. When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fill her a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang, give it to her to drink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her. Then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her; and such is my advice.""[FN#218] ""Thy rede is aright,"" quoth the King, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a piece of concentrated Bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year. This he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by, when he betook himself to the palace of Princess Abrizah, who seeing him stood up to receive him; but he bade her sit down. So she sat down, and he sat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail, whereupon she furnished the carousing table[FN#219] and placed it before him. Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking. So they fell to tippling and the King ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head; and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from his pocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off. Then filling a second he said, ""To thy companionship!""; and dropped the drug into her cup, she knowing naught of it. She took it and drank it off; then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber. He waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs. When the King saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could not master himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head. Then he rose off her and went to one of her women, by name Marjánah, and said, ""Go in to thy lady and speak with her."" So she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to the calves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night. As soon as Almighty Allah brought the dawn, the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus.[FN#220] Then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah, ""Tell me what hath befallen me."" So she told her what had passed and how she had found her, lying on her back, with the blood running down, wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy, saying to her damsels, ""Deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that I am ill, till I see what Allah will do with me."" Presently the news of her sickness came to the King; so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries. Some months she thus passed in solitude, during which time the King's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. Now she had conceived by him, and when the months of child breeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said to her handmaid Marjanah, ""Know that it is not the folk who have wronged me, but I who sinned against my own self[FN#221] in that I left my father and mother and country. Indeed, I abhor life, for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me. I used, when I mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him, but now I am unable to ride. If I be brought to bed among them I shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame; and if I return to my father, with what face shall I meet him or with what face shall I have recourse to him? How well quoth the poet,<br>
<br>
'Say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *<br>
             Nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'""<br>
<br>
Marjanah answered her, ""It is thine to command; I will obey;"" and Abrizah said, ""I desire at once to leave this place secretly, so that none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father and my mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it but its own folk and Allah shall do with me e'en as He will."" ""O Princess,"" Marjanah replied, ""what thou wouldest do is well."" Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the King went out to chase and hunt, and his son Sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile. Then said she to Marjanah, ""I wish to set out this night, but how shall I do against my destiny? For already I feel the pangs of labour and child birth, and if I abide other four or five days, I shall be brought to bed here, and I shall be unable to travel to my country. But this is what was written on my forehead."" Then she considered awhile, and said to Marjanah, ""Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way, for I have no strength to bear arms."" ""By Allah, O my lady,"" replied Marjanah, ""I know none but a black slave called Al- Ghazbán,[FN#222] who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at our palace gate. The King appointed him to attend us, and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, I will go out and speak with him of this matter, and promise him some monies and tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, I will marry him to whom he will. He told me before to day that he had been a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land."" She rejoined, ""Call him that I may talk with him;"" whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to the slave, 'O Ghazban, Allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee!"" Then she took him by the hand and brought him to the Princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him, her heart took fright at him. ""How ever,"" she said to herself, ""of a truth, Need giveth the law;"" and she approached to speak with him, yet her heart started away from him. Presently she said, ""O Ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidies of Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee?"" When the slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply; ""O my mistress, whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will not depart therefrom."" Quoth she, ""I would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thou desire to abide with us, I will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine own land, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires"" after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee."" When Al Ghazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, ""O my lady, I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses."" Then he went away gladsome and saying to himself, ""I shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me, I will kill them both and take their riches."" But he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode, and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mounting the third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish. And the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains, till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country; when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longer resist; so she said to Al-Ghazban, ""Set me down, for the pains of labour are upon me;"" and cried to Marjanah, ""Do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me."" Then Marjanah dismounted from her horse, and Al-Ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast the bridles and helped the Princess to dismount, for she was aswoon from excess of anguish. When Al-Ghazban saw her on the ground, Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face, said ""O my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours."" Hearing these words she turned to him and said, ""It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-second Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban, ""It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!"" And she was wroth with him and cried, ""Woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest? Out on thee, and talk not thus in my presence and know that I will never consent to what thou sayest, though I drink the cup of death. Wait till I have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thou be able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this."" And she began reciting extempore,[FN#223]<br>
<br>
""O spare me, thou Ghazban, indeed enow for me * Are heavy strokes<br>
            of time, mischance and misery!<br>
Whoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity; * Quoth He, 'Who<br>
           breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see!'<br>
And if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * Against th'<br>
          Almighty's choicest gift, my chastity,<br>
Upon my tribesmen I with might and main will call * And gather<br>
          all, however far or near they be;<br>
And with Yamáni blade were I in pieces hewn, * Ne'er shall he<br>
           sight my face who makes for villeiny,<br>
The face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * What then<br>
            can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?""<br>
<br>
When Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey[FN#224]; his nostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled. And he repeated these couplets,<br>
<br>
""Ho thou, Abrizah, mercy! leave me not for I * Of thy love and<br>
             Yamáni[FN#225] glance the victim lie<br>
My heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * My body wasted and my<br>
                   patience done to die:<br>
From glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * Reason far<br>
           flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh;<br>
Though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * E'en<br>
           now I'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!""<br>
<br>
When Abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, ""Woe to thee, O Ghazban! How dareth the like of thee to address me such demand, O base born and obscene bred? Dost thou deem all folk are alike?"" When the vile slave heard this from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death. Then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, she gave birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side; and lo and behold! the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying.[FN#226] When Marjanah saw this, she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, ""Alas, my mistress! Alas, the pity of it! Thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!"" And she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon;[FN#227] but, after awhile, it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host. Now this was the army of King Hardub, Princess Abrizah's father, and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to Baghdad, and that they were with King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the King. When he had gone a single day's march from his capital, he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter. Now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanah and the slave Al- Ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so he killed Abrizah and fled for his life. When they came up, King Hardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her, and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground. All the riders of his company, the Emirs and Waxirs, took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the King a great pavilion, domed and circular, without which stood the grandees of the realm. When Marjanah saw her master, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and, when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said, ""Of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and she informed him how Sharrkan's father had dealt with the Princess. When King Hardub heard this, the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping. Then he called for a litter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned to Caesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, and said to that Lady of Calamities, ""Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl? Verily King Omar bin al-Nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this, one of his black slaves slew her. By the truth of the Messiah, I will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame; else will I kill myself with mine own hand!"" And he wept passing sore. Quoth his mother, ""None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated her in secret;"" and she continued to her son, ""Fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the Messiah, I will not turn back from King Omar bin al-Nu'uman till I have slain him and his sons; and of a very truth I will do with him a deed, passing the power of Sage and Knight, whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place: but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct, for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire."" ""By the virtue of the Messiah,"" replied he, ""I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say."" Then quoth she, ""Bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before Kings, and the art of conversation and making verses; and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge. And the sages must be Moslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions of the Arabs, together with the history of the Caliphs and the ancient annals of the Kings of Al-Islam; and if we persevere in this for four years' space, we shall gain our case. So possess thy soul in patience and wait; for one of the Arabs saith, 'If we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' When we have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to work our will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, she that hath found mercy.[FN#228] As soon as I have made an end of their education, as described to thee, I will take them and set out with them in person."" When King Hardub heard his mother's words, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him Moslem sages. They obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought. When these came into presence, he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels. Then he committed the handmaidens to their hands—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-third Night.<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub, he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they set themselves to do his bidding. Such was the case with King Hardub; but as for King Omar bin al Nu'uman, when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he sought Princess Abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her. This was grievous to him and he said, ""How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any? Had my kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it! I will never again go to sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them!"" And he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah. Hereupon behold, his son Sharrkan returned from his journey; and the father told him what had happened, and informed him how the lady had fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grieved with exceeding grief. Then King Omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for them stipends. When Sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, ""Why do I see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?"" ""O my father,"" replied Sharrkan, ""every time I see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and I fear lest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return. And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion. But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest, that I may abide there the remnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'Absence from my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'Whatso eye doth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'"" And he bowed his head towards the ground. When King Omar bin al-Nu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, ""O my son, I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater than the Castle of Damascus, and the government of it is thine from this time."" Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write Sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of Damascus of Syria. And when they had written it, he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan, and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandees and officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. When he arrived at Damascus, the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank, and the others to the left. Thus far concerning Sharrkan; but as regards his father, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him, ""O our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony."" The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing Zau al- Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship. The Prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers, loving the poor, the Olema and the Koran students, so that all the people of Baghdad loved him, men and women. One day, the procession of the Mahmil[FN#229] of Irák passed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to Meccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!). When Zau al-Makan the Mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim,[FN#230] so he went in to his sire and said, ""I come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage."" But his father forbade him saying, ""Wait till next year and I will go and thou too."" When the Prince saw that the matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, whom he found standing at prayer. As soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her, ""I am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit the tomb of the Prophet, upon whom be peace! I asked my father's leave, but he forbade me that, so I mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge."" ""Allah upon thee,"" exclaimed she, ""take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and keep!"" And he answered, ""As soon as it is dark night, do thou come forth from this place, without telling any."" Accordingly,When it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceased not walking to the palace gate, where she found Zau al-Makan with camels ready for marching. So he mounted and mounted her; and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki[FN#231] pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and Allah wrote safety for them, till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood upon Arafát and performed the pilgrimage rites. Then they made a visitation to the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and assain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land. But Zau al-Makan said to his sister, ""O my sister, it is in my mind to visit the Holy House,[FN#232] Jerusalem, and Abraham the Friend of Allah[FN#233] (on whom be peace!)."" ""I also desire so to do,"" replied she. So they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalem palmers. That very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, after which the brother also sickened. She tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at Jerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker. They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging; but Zau al- Makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious. At this, his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the decree of Allah!"" They sojourned in that place awhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left. Then she sent a servant of the Khan to the bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother; then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, till nothing was left but an old rug. Whereupon she wept and exclaimed, ""Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and the future!"" Presently her brother said to her, ""O my sister, I feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat."" ""By Allah! O my brother,"" replied she, ""I have no face to beg; but tomorrow I will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living."" Then she bethought herself awhile and said, ""Of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state, but I must despite myself!"" He rejoined, ""Allah forbid! Thou wilt be put to shame; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah!"" And he wept and she wept too. Then she said, ""O my brother, we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at our door. Shall we then die of hunger? I know no resource but that I go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, till thou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to our native land."" She sat weeping awhile and he wept too, propped upon his elbow. Then Nuzhat al-Zaman arose and, veiling her head with a bit of camlet,[FN#234] which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend. And she stinted not going and her brother Zau al-Makan awaiting her return till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; and this endured till two days went by. He was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore upon him. At last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of the caravanserai, said, ""I wish thee to bear me to the bazar."" So he carried him to the market street and laid him down there; and the people of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition. He signed to them begging for somewhat to eat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith; after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head. When night fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and, in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him. Then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, ""Carry this sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply he may be cured and recover health."" ""On my head be it!"" replied the camel man; but he said to himself, ""How shall I take this sick man to Damascus, and he nigh upon death?"" So he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went his way. When morning dawned the Stoker[FN#235] of the bath came to his work and, finding Zau al-Makan cast on his back, exclaimed, ""Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?"" So saying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth the Fireman, ""Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!"" Then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land. And he cried, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! verily, I have sinned against this youth, for indeed the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when the stranger is sick."" Then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him. So she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face. Meanwhile, the Stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar, and sprinkled Zau al-Makan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet. Then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him. With this, Zau al-Makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against the pillow. Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, ""Praise be to Allah for the welfare of this youth! O Allah, I beseech Thee by Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-fourth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fireman exclaimed, ""O Allah, I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make this young man's life the work of my hands!"" And he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, till health began to return to his body and Zau al-Makan opened his eyes. Presently came in the Fireman and, seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment, said to him, ""What is now thy state, O my son?"" ""Praise be to Allah,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""I am well and like to recover, if such be the will of Allah Almighty at this time."" The Stoker praised the Lord of All for this and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, which he carried to his wife and said, ""Kill two of these for him every day, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day."" So she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth. When he had done eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after which she cut it up and, bringing it to Zau al-Makan, said, ""Eat, O my son!"" While he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeing her feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, ""How is it with thee now, O my son?"" ""Thanks be to Allah for recovery!"" he replied: ""may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me."" At this the Fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it. Now the Stoker used to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams, whereof he spent every day, for Zau al-Makan, one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water,[FN#236] and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole. Thereupon the Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, ""O my son, wilt thou go with me to the bath?""; whereto he answered, ""Yes!"" So the Stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mounted Zau al-Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath. Then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market and bought Iote leaves and lupin-flour,[FN#237] with which he returned to the bath and said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my master, in Allah's name, walk in and I will wash thy body."" So they entered the inner room of the bath, and the Fireman took to rubbing Zau al-Makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper had sent to Zau al-Makan; and he, seeing the Stoker washing and rubbing him, said, ""This is doing injury to the keeper's rights."" Replied the Fireman, ""The master overwhelmeth us with his favours!"" Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al-Makan's head, after which he and the Stoker washed themselves and returned to the house, where he clad Zau al-Makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. Meanwhile the Fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens; so, as soon as Zau al-Makan entered and seated himself on the carpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flower water, made him drink of it. Then he brought the food tray and, cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his hands and praised Allah for recovery, and said to the Fireman, ""Thou art he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure!"" ""Leave this talk,"" replied the other, ""and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art. Thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding."" ""Tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me,"" said Zau al-Makan; ""and after I will tell thee my story."" Rejoined the Fireman, ""As for that, I found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as I went to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrown thee there. So I carried thee home with me; and this is all my tale."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""Glory to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! Indeed, O my brother, thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage."" And he added, ""But where am I now?"" ""Thou art in the city of Jerusalem,"" replied the Stoker; where upon Zau al-Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept. Then he discovered his secret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating,<br>
<br>
""In love they bore me further than my force would go, * And for<br>
            them made me suffer resurrection throe:<br>
Oh, have compassion, cruel! on this soul of mine * Which, since<br>
            ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe;<br>
Nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * My case to<br>
            lighten, easing this excess of woe:<br>
Quoth I 'Heart, bear this loss in patience!' Patience cried *<br>
             'Take heed! no patience in such plight I'm wont to show.' ""<br>
<br>
Then he redoubled his weeping, and the Fireman said to him, ""Weep not, but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery."" Asked Zau al-Makan, ""How far is it hence to Damascus?"" Answered the other, ""Six days' journey."" Then quoth Zau al-Makan, ""Wilt thou send me thither?"" ""O my lord,"" quoth the Stoker, ""how can I allow thee to go alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot? If thou would journey to Damascus, I am one who will go with thee; and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, I will take up my abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee."" Then said he to his wife, ""Wilt thou travel with me to Damascus of Syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst I lead this my lord thither and return to thee? For he is bent upon going to Damascus of Syria and, by Allah, it is hard to me to part with him, and I fear for him from highway men."" Replied she, ""I will go with you both;"" and he rejoined, ""Praised be Allah for accord, and we have said the last word!"" Then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gear,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-fifth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fire man and his wife agreed with Zau al-Makan to travel with him Damascus wards. Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al-Makan; and they set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached Damascus. And they arrived there towards eventide; when the Fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat and drink. They had dwelt but five days in Damascus, when his wife sickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercy of Almighty Allah. Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al-Makan, for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously; and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief. Presently the Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning, said to him, ""Grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in."" Replied he, ""Allah make weal thy lot, O my son! Surely He will compensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease. What sayst thou, O my son, about our walking abroad to view Damascus and cheer thy spirits?"" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""Thy will is mine."" So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zau al- Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the Viceroy of Damascus, where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddled and Bactrian dromedaries, while Mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro. Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""I wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!"" So he asked one of the eunuchs, ""Whither this dispatching?'' and he answered, ""These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with the tribute of Syria."" Now when Zau al-Makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears, and he began repeating,<br>
<br>
""Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * Ye whose sight<br>
             in my spirit shall ever dwell!<br>
Your charms are gone, but this heart of me * Hath no sweet, and<br>
             no pleasures its sour dispel;<br>
If Allah's grace make us meet again, * In long drawn love-tale my<br>
             love I'll tell.""<br>
<br>
And when he had ended his verse, he wept and the Fireman said to him, ""O my son, we hardly believed that thy health had returned;[FN#238] so take heart and do not weep, for I fear a relapse for thee."" And he ceased not comforting and cheering him, whilst Zau al-Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family; and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,<br>
<br>
""Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *<br>
           And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay:<br>
All thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * All<br>
           thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display:<br>
Say is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * Where<br>
           at night he 'nakhs'[FN#239] his camels and moves off at dawn<br>
           of day?""<br>
<br>
And he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst the Fireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not to comfort Zau al-Makan till morning dawned. When the sun rose, he said to him, ""Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?"" ""Yes,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""and I can no longer tarry here; so I will commend thee to Allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them, little by little, till I come to my mother land."" Said the Stoker, ""And I with thee; for of a truth I cannot bear to part with thee. I have done thee kindly service and I mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel."" At this, Zau al-Makan rejoiced and said, ""Allah abundantly requite thee for me!"" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, selling the camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al-Makan, ""This is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary of riding, thou canst dismount and walk."" Said Zau al-Makan, ""May Allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee! for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother."" Then he waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey. This much befel Zau al-Makan and the Fireman; but as regards what happened to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she left her brother in the Khan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out to seek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping and knowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying,<br>
<br>
""Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me<br>
            dree, * And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my<br>
           tormentry,<br>
And cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * And<br>
           drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy<br>
And longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * And<br>
          tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecy<br>
No cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * That I may<br>
            quit this sickly state, may cure my malady:<br>
The love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * The<br>
           lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell's agony![FN#240]<br>
O thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * Patient I<br>
           bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me:<br>
By Love I swear I'll never be consoled, no, never more; * I swear<br>
             the oath of Love's own slaves who know no perjury:<br>
O Night, to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare; * That<br>
           sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!""<br>
<br>
Then she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as she went, when behold, there espied her an old Badawi[FN#241] who had come into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five. The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvelling at her beauty, he said to himself, ""This charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger, I needs must have her."" So he followed her, little by little, till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and called out to her, asking her case, and said, ""Tell me, O my little daughter! art thou a free woman or a slave?"" When she heard this, she said to him, ""By thy life, do not add to my sorrows!"" Quoth he, ""Allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom five died and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and I came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; that I might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters. If thou have no kith and kin, I will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children."" Nuzhat al-Zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself, ""Haply I may trust myself to this old man."" Then she said to him, ""O nuncle, I am a maiden of the Arabs and a stranger and I have a sick brother; but I will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition, which is, that I may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother. If thou strike this bargain I will fare with thee, for I am a stranger and I was high in honour among my tribe, and I awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject. I came with my brother from the land of Al-Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am."" When the Badawi heard this, he said to himself, ""By Allah, I have got my desire!"" Then he turned to her and replied, ""There shall none be dearer to me than thou; I wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall. Or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us."" And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him. Then he walked on before her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions, ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels. Now this Badawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master of plots and chicane. He had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when, by the decree of the Decreer, he fell in with this unhappy one. And he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of Jerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries. So the Badawi mounted a camel, having seated Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him and they rode on all night. Then she knew that the Badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for the mountains, in fear any should see them. Now when it was near dawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi came up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said to her, ""O city strumpet, what is this weeping? By Allah, an thou hold not thy peace, I will beat thee to death, O thou town filth!"" When she heard this she loathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said, ""O accursed old man, O gray beard of hell, how have I trusted thee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst torture me?"" When he heard her reply he cried out, ""O lazy baggage, dost thou dare to bandy words with me?"" And he stood up to her and beat her with a whip, saying, ""An thou hold not thy peace, I will kill thee!"" So she was silent awhile, then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly. Next day, she turned to the Badawi and said to him, ""How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?"" When he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, ""O lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent! wilt thou bandy words with me?"" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint. Then she bowed down over his feet and kissed[FN#242] them; and he left beating her and began reviling her and said, ""By the rights of my bonnet,[FN#243] if I see or hear thee weeping, I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte, O thou city filth!"" So she was silent and made him no reply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her arms round her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how they were both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,<br>
<br>
""Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * Nor is lasting<br>
           condition for human race:<br>
In this world each thing hath appointed turn; * Nor may man<br>
            transgress his determined place:<br>
How long these perils and woes? Ah woe * For a life, all woeful<br>
            in parlous case!<br>
Allah bless not the days which have laid me low * I' the world,<br>
            with disgrace after so much grace!<br>
My wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * And distance forbids me<br>
             to greet his face:<br>
O thou who passeth that dear one's door, * Say for me, these<br>
             tears shall flow evermore!""<br>
<br>
When she had finished her verses, the Badawi came up to her and, taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears. Then he gave her a barley scone and said, ""I love not one who answereth at times when I am in wrath: so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a good man like myself, who will do well with thee, even as I have done."" ""Yes; whatso thou doest is right,"" answered she; and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she ate very little of that barley bread. In the middle of the night the Badawi gave orders for departure,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-sixth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Badawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al-Zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, ""Whatso thou doest is right!"" and, about midnight when hunger burned her,[FN#244] she ate a very little of that barley bread and the Badawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him. Then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, till they entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan's Khan, hard by the Viceroy's Gate. Now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes. So the Badawi came up to her and said, ""O thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thou leave not this weeping, I will sell thee to none but a Jew!"" Then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber, and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchants who dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying, ""I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and I sent him to my people about Jerusalem, that they might tend him till he is cured. As for her I want to sell her, but after the dog her brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous to her, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now I wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say, 'Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill'; and I will be easy with him about her price."" Then one of the merchants came up to him and asked, ""How old is she?"" He answered ""She is a virgin, just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness. But from the day I sent her brother to Jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning for him, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened."" Now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the Badawi and said, ""O Shaykh[FN#245] of the Arabs, I will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness; and I will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, I will give thee ready money, and if thou accept not I will return her to thee."" Quoth the Badawi, ""An thou wilt, take her up to the Sultan Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest, for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan, haply she will please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot."" Rejoined the merchant, ""It happens that I have just now something to ask from him, and it is this that he write me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. So if he take the girl, I will weigh[FN#246] thee out her price at once."" ""I agree with thee to this condition,"" answered the Badawi. So they returned together to the place where Nuzhat al-Zaman was and the wild Arab stood at the chamber door and called out, saying, ""O Nájiyah[FN#247]!"" which was the name wherewith he had named her. When she heard him, she wept and made no answer. Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""There she sitteth; go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee."" So the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the Arabic tongue; and he said to the Badawi, ""If she be even as thou saddest, I shall get of the Sultan what I will for her."" Then he bespake her, ""Peace be on thee, my little maid! How art thou?"" She turned to him and replied, ""This also was registered in the Book of Destiny."" Then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said to herself, ""I believe this one cometh to buy me;"" and she continued, ""If I hold aloof from him, I shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating. In any case, this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi. May be he cometh only to hear me talk; so I will give him a fair answer."" All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice, ""And upon thee be peace, O my lord, and Allah's mercy and His benediction![FN#248] This is what is commanded of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and preserve! As for thine enquiry how I am, if thou wouldst know my case, it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe."" And she held her peace. When the merchant heard what she said, his fancy took wings for delight in her and, turning to the Badawi, he asked him, ""What is her price, for indeed she is noble?"" Thereupon the Badawi waxed angry and answered, ""Thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk! Why dost thou say that she is noble,[FN#249] while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk? I will not sell her to thee!"" When the merchant heard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him, ""Calm thyself, for I will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest."" ""And how much wilt thou give me for her?"" enquired the Badawi. Replied the merchant, ""Name thy price for her: none should name the son save his sire."" Rejoined the Badawi, ""None shall name it but thou thyself."" Quoth the merchant to himself, ""This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head. By Allah, I cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write, it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser. But this Badawi does not know her worth."" Then he turned and said to him, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will give thee in ready money, clear of the tax and the Sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces."" Now when the Badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant, saying, ""Get up and go thy ways! By Allah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth, I would not sell it to thee. And now I will not sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels and grind my grist."" And he cried out to her, saying, ""Come here, thou stinkard! I will not sell thee."" Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""I used to think thee a man of judgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not from me, I will let thee hear what shall not please thee!"" Quoth the merchant to himself, ""Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knoweth not her value, and I will say no more to him about her price at the present time; for by Allah, were he a man of sense, he would not say, 'By the rights of my bonnet!' By the Almighty, she is worth the kingdom of the Chosroës and I have not her price by me, but if he ask even more, I will give him what he will, though it be all my goods."" Then he turned and said to him, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee?"" Cried the Badawi, ""And what hath the baggage to do with clothes? By Allah, this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her."" ""With thy leave,"" said the merchant, ""I will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying.""[FN#250] Replied the other, ""Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth! Examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked."" Quoth the trader, ""Allah forfend! I will look at naught save her face.""[FN#251] Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness,—And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-seventh Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant went up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, ""O my mistress, what is thy name?"" She answered, ""Doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day?"" Thereupon the merchant enquired, ""Hast thou then two names: to day's and yesterday's?"" ""Yes,"" replied she, ""my name in the past was Nuzhat al-Zaman, the Delight of the Age; but my name at this present is Ghussat[FN#252] al-Zaman, the Despight of the Age."" When the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her, ""Hast thou not a sick brother?"" ""Ay by Allah, O my lord, I have,"" quoth she, ""but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in Jerusalem."" The merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, ""Verily, the Badawi spake the truth of her."" Then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to her with the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped; and she began reciting,<br>
<br>
""Allah, where'er thou be, His aid impart * To thee, who distant<br>
             dwellest in my heart!<br>
Allah be near thee how so far thou fare; * Ward off all shifts of<br>
            Time, all dangers thwart!<br>
Mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * And start my<br>
            tears-ah me, how fast they start!<br>
Would Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land * Homes thee, and<br>
           in what house and tribe thou art<br>
A fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * While drink I<br>
             tear drops for my sole desert?<br>
An thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when I * Peel 'twixt my side<br>
           and couch coals' burning smart?<br>
All things were easy save to part from thee, * For my sad heart<br>
           this grief is hard to dree.""<br>
<br>
When the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veil over her face, saying, ""Heaven forbid, O my lord!''[FN#253] Then the Badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them, saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her, dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face. Her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streamed down her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly. The merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself, ""There is no help for it but that I buy this damsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from this tyrant."" And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al- Zaman lay in sensible. When she came to herself, she wiped away the tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head: then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her Lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating,<br>
<br>
""And pity one who erst in honour throve, * And now is fallen into<br>
             sore disgrace.<br>
She weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * And asks<br>
            'What cure can meet this fatal case?'""<br>
<br>
When she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone, ""By the Almighty, do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not Allah the Most High! If I pass this night in his place, I shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, so Allah save thee from Gehenna-fire."" Then quoth the merchant to the Badawi, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, this slave is none of thine affair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt."" ""Take her,"" quoth the Badawi, ""and pay me down her price, or I will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung.""[FN#254] Said the merchant, ""I will give thee fifty thousand diners for her."" ""Allah will open!""[FN#255] replied the Badawi. ""Seventy thousand,"" said the merchant. ""Allah will open!"" repeated the Badawi: ""this is not the capital spent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces."" The merchant rejoined, ""Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but I will say thee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, I will set the Viceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force."" The Badawi continued, ""Say on!"" ""An hundred thousand,"" quoth the merchant. ""I have sold her to thee at that price,"" answered the Badawi; ""I shall be able to buy salt with her."" The merchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the money and put it into the hand of the Badawi, who took it and made off, saying to himself, ""Needs must I go to Jerusalem where, haply, I shall happen on her brother, and I will bring him here and sell him also."" So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at Jerusalem, where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al-Makan, but could not find him. Such was the case with him; but for what regards the merchant and Nazhat al-Zaman, when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-eighth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the trader saved Nuzhat al-Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down with her to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying, ""All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that, when I lead thee to the Sultan, Viceroy of Damascus, thou acquaint him with the price I paid for thee, albeit it was little compared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me, thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith I can repair to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad, to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which I traffic."" When she heard his words, she wept and sobbed, and the merchant said to her, ""O my lady, I observe that, every time I mention Baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is there any one there whom thou lovest? If it be a trader or the like, tell me; for I know all the merchants and so forth there and, if thou wouldst send him a message, I will bear it for thee."" Replied she, ""By Allah, I have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like! I know none there but King Omar bin Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad."" When the merchant heard her words, he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, ""By Allah, I have won my wish!"" Then he said to her, ""Hast thou been shown to him in time past?"" She answered, ""No, but I was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour with him; so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire, give me ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter; and when thou reachest the city of Baghdad, do thou deliver it into the hand of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and say to him, 'Thy handmaid, Nuzhat al-Zaman, would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer, and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place, and she sendeth thee her salams.' And, if he ask further of her, say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus."" The merchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for her increased and he said to her I cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money. Tell me, dost thou know the Koran by heart?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; ""and I am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen, the physician, on the canons of Hippocrates; and I have commented him and I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burhán; and I have studied the Simples of Ibn Baytár, and I have something to say of the canon of Meccah, by Avicenna. I can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy I have read the books of the Sháfi'í[FN#256] school and the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax; and I can argue with the Olema and discourse of all manner learning. Moreover I am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs, and I know thoroughly the Spiritual Sciences[FN#257] and the times appointed for religious duties and I understand all these branches of knowledge."" Then quoth she to the merchant, ""Bring me ink case and paper, that I write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enable thee to do without passports."" Now when the merchant heard this, he cried out ""Brava! Brava![FN#258] Then O happy he in whose palace thou shalt! Thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour. She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses,<br>
<br>
""I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * Say, did<br>
           thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone?<br>
What makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart? * Hath<br>
            every lover strength such memories to own?<br>
How sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *<br>
            'Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar 'tis flown:<br>
I pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * From thee,<br>
            to lover wightwi' love so woe begone<br>
Complains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * For parting<br>
             pangs can break not only heart but stone.""<br>
<br>
And when she had ended writing the verses she continued, ""These words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight. She tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length. No helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses,<br>
<br>
'No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * But<br>
             shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might:<br>
No lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * To meet his<br>
             mate, but breeds in me redoubled blight<br>
I bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * Ah me, how Love<br>
             can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' ""<br>
Then her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also these two couplets,<br>
<br>
""Love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * That severance<br>
             severed sleep and eyes for aye.<br>
I waxt so lean that I am still a man, * But for my speaking, thou<br>
             wouldst never say.""<br>
<br>
Then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, ""This cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, the sorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al-Zaman."" In fine, she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed, ""Glory to Him who fashioned thee!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Fifty-ninth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed, ""Glory to Him who fashioned thee!"" Then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fed her; after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to the bath woman, ""As soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head, dress her and send and let me know of it."" And she replied ""Hearing is obeying."" Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath; and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench. Then she sent to tell the merchant, and Nuzhat al-Zaman went forth to the outer room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. So she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath. Then she slept till the morning, and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her. When he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her, presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners, a suit of Turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. Moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel. Now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezel of balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money. When she had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her. But when folk saw her, all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed, ""Blessed be Allah, the most excellent Creator! O lucky the man in whose house the hall be!"" And the trader ceased not walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace of Sultan Sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing the earth between his hands, said, ""O auspicious King, I have brought thee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities."" Quoth the King, ""Let me see it."" So the merchant went out and brought her, she following him till he made her stand before King Sharrkan. When he beheld her, blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al- Zaman and a brother Zau al-Makan, he having been jealous of them, because of the succession. And such was the cause of his knowing little about them. Then, having placed her before the presence, the merchant said, ""O King of the age, besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in all learning, sacred and profane, including the art of government and the abstract sciences."" Quoth the King to the trader, ""Take her price, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways."" ""I hear and I obey,"" replied the merchant; ""but first write me a patent, exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise."" Said the King, ""I will do this, but first tell me what price thou paidest for her."" Said the merchant, ""I bought her for an hundred thousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand."" When the Sultan heard these words, he declared, ""I will give thee a higher price than this for her;"" and, calling his treasurer, said to him, ""Pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit."" Thereupon the Sultan summoned the four Kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said, ""I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her."" So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage, when the Sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse. Then, after paying him his monies, Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent, exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him, and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixtieth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after paying him his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour. Then all about him retired, and none remained save the Kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges, ""I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions."" They answered, ""There is no evil in that!""; and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet, when they learned that she was become the King's wife. Then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that King Sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in all branches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four Kazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them. So they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al- Zaman. When they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standing before her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, her handmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying, ""Ye be welcome!"" The while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up with them; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another, ""This damsel is none other than a Queen, the daughter of a King."" Then they sat down, magnifying her worth and said to her, ""O our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence. The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by Allah, do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty."" And she thanked them for this. All this while the curtains were let down between Nuzhat al-Zaman and the women with her, on the one side, and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other. Presently King Sharrkan called to her and said, ""O Queen, the glory of thine age, this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, even to astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects."" She replied, saying: ""O King, to hear is to obey.[FN#259] The first subjects whereof I will treat are the art of government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law, and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. Know then, O King, that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save through this world, because it is the best road to futurity. Now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people, and men's doings are divided into four divisions, government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship. Now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world, which world is the road to futurity; since Allah Almighty hath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah, and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust. If folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, all cause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires, and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of the Sultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs; and, if the King restrain not his folk from one another, the strong will drive the weak to the wall. Hence Ardeshir[FN#260] saith, 'Religion and Kingship be twins'; religion is a hidden treasure and the King is its keeper; and the Divine Ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule. For know, O King, that according to the measure of the Sultan's good morals, even so will be the time; as saith the Apostle of Allah (on whom be peace and salvation!), 'There be two classes who, if they be good, the people will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad, even the Olema and the Emirs.' And it is said by a certain sage, 'There be three kinds of Kings, the King of the Faith, the King who protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the King of his own lusts.' The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith, and it behoveth he be the most faithful,[FN#261] for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the Faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance; but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented, because of submission to the decrees of Destiny. As for the King who protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the things of the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to follow the Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and it fitteth him to unite Pen and Sword; for whoso declineth from what Pen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify his error with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over all mankind. As for the King of his own lusts, he hath no religion but the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath of his Lord who set him on the throne, so his Kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. And sages say, 'The King hath need of many people, but the people have need of but one King' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord to concord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all. And know, O King, that Ardeshir, styled Jamr Shadíd, or the Live Coal, third of the Kings of Persia, conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings, one for each division. The first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written, Alterna lives. The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies, and on it was written, Building up. The third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written, Plenty. The fourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written, Justice. And these usages remained valid in Persia until the revelation of Al-Islam. Chosroës also wrote his son, who was with the army, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee.'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixty-first night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Chosroës wrote his son, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly with them, or they will murmur against thee. Give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.' There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al- Mansúr[FN#262] and said, 'Starve thy dog and he shall follow thee.' When the Caliph heard his words, he was enraged with the Arab, but Abu 'l-Abbás of Tús said to him, 'I fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow him and leave thee alone.' Thereupon the Caliph Al-Mansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present. And know, O King, that Abd al-Malik bin Marwán wrote to his brother Abd al-Azíz, when he despatched him to Egypt, as follows, 'Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thy Chamberlains, for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of official ceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee.' Omar bin Al-Khattáb[FN#263] (whom Allah accept!) when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts, the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period. It is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there is no prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near to God like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour; that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law, no science like that of meditation, no worship like obeying the Divine commends, no faith like modesty, no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge. So guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth. Saith Ali (whose face Allah honour!), 'Beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them: consult them not in aught;[FN#264] but grudge not complaisance to them, lest they greed for intrigue.' And eke quoth he, 'Whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules for this which we will mention, if it be Allah's will. And Omar (whom Allah accept!) saith, 'There are three kinds of women, firstly the true believing, Heaven fearing, love full and fruit full, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate against her mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and, lastly, she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom He will.' Men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight. Justice is indispensable in all things; even slave girls have need of justice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, their order would fall to pieces.[FN#265] In short, for the rest, the Prince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence; and how excellent is the saying of the poet,<br>
<br>
By open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * Go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'<br>
<br>
And quoth another,<br>
<br>
'In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * And<br>
             Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul:<br>
Whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good<br>
             word, * On glory's course must ever be the first to gain the<br>
             goal.'""<br>
<br>
And Nazhat al-Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till the bystanders said, ""Never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel! Haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this."" When she heard their words and understood them she said, ""As for the chapter of good breeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of things perfect. Now it so happened that one day there came to the Caliph Mu'áwiyah[FN#266] one of his companions, who mentioned the people of Irak and the goodness of their wit; and the Caliph's wife Maysún, mother of Yezíd, heard his words. So, when he was gone, she said to the Caliph, 'O Prince of the Faithful, I would thou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee, that I may hear their discourse.' Therewith Mu'awiyah said to his attendants, 'See who is at the door?' And they answered, 'The Banu Tamim.' 'Let them come in,' said he. So they came in and with them Al-Ahnáf son of Kays.[FN#267] Then quoth Mu'awiyah, 'Enter, O Abu Bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself and Maysun, that she might hear what they said without being seen herself; then he said to Al-Ahnaf, 'O Son of the Sea, draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' Quoth Al-Ahnaf, 'Part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes[FN#268] and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and make the Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday, as an expiation for all between the Fridays.'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixty-second Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahnaf bin Kays replied to Al-Mu'awiyah's[FN#269] question, 'And ever use the toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two Fridays.' Quoth Mu'awiyah, 'What is thy counsel to thyself?' 'To set my feet firmly on the ground, to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'How dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe?' 'I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first; I avoid what concerneth me not and I spare my words!' 'And how when thou goest in to thine equals?' 'I give ear to them when they speak and I do not assail them when they err!' 'When thou goest in to thy chiefs?' 'I salute without making any sign and await the reply: if they bid me draw near, I draw near, and if they draw off from me I withdraw!' 'How dost thou with thy wife?' Quoth Ahnaf, 'Excuse me from answering this, O Commander of the Faithful!'; but Mu'awiyah cried, 'I conjure thee inform me.' He said, 'I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.'[FN#270] 'And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'I bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire; then, should it be as thou knowest,[FN#271] I throw her on her back. If the seed abide in her womb I say, 'O Allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the best of fashions!'[FN#272] Then I rise from her to ablution and first I pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, I praise Allah for the joy He hath given me.' Said Mu'awiyah, 'Thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements?' Said Ahnaf, 'I would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them.' Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph's presence, and when he had gone Maysun said, 'Were there but this man in Irak, he would suffice to it.' Then continued Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, and know O King, that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattáb,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixty-third Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, ""Know, O King, that Mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab; and it so befel him that he saw Omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury. Thereupon, quoth Mu'aykib, 'I returned to my own house, and while I was sitting there behold, a messenger came to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him, and when I came into his presence, in his hand was the dirham I had given his son. He said to me, 'Woe to thee Mu'aykib! I have found somewhat concerning thy soul.' I asked 'And what is that?'; and he answered, 'It is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of Mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in the matter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it on Resurrection Day.'[FN#273] And Omar also wrote a letter to Abú Músá al-Ashári[FN#274] as follows, 'When these presents reach thee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.' And he did so. Now when Othman succeeded to the Caliphate, he wrote a like letter to Abu Musa, who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly, and with it came Ziyád.[FN#275] And when Ziyad laid the tribute before Othman, the Caliph's son came in and took a dirham, whereupon Ziyad shed tears. Othman asked 'Why weepest thou?'; and Ziyad answered, 'I once brought Omar bin al-Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where upon Omar bade snatch it from his hand. Now thy son hath taken of the tribute, yet I have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him.' Then Othman[FN#276] cried, 'And where wilt thou find the like of Omar?' Again Zayd bin Aslam relates of his father that he said, 'I went out one night with Omar till we approached a blazing fire. Quoth Omar, 'O Aslam, I think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold. Come, let us join them.' So we walked on till we came to them and behold! we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children, both a wailing. Said Omar, 'Peace be with you, O folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire'),[FN#277] what aileth you?' Said she, 'The cold and the night trouble us.' He asked, 'What aileth these little people that they weep?'; and she answered, 'They are hungry.' He enquired, 'And what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'It is what I quiet them withal, and Allah will question Omar bin al- Khattab of them, on the Day of Doom.' He said, 'And what should Omar know of their case?' 'Why then,' rejoined she, 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' Thereupon Omar turned to me (continned Aslam) and cried, 'Come with us!' So we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me, 'Load these on my back!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I will carry them for thee.' He rejoined, 'Wilt thou bear my load for me on the Day of Resurrection?' So I put the things on his back, and we set off, running, till we threw down the sack hard by her. Then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying to the woman, 'Leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron. Now he was a long bearded man[FN#278] and I saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman, 'Bed them while I cool it for them.' So they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the rest with her. Then he turned to me and said, 'O Aslam, I see it was indeed hunger made them weep; and I am glad I did not go away ere I found out the cause of the light I saw.'—And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixty-fourth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, ""It is related that Omar passed by a flock of sheep, kept by a Mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep. He answered, 'They are not mine.' 'Thou art the man I sought,' said Omar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slave exclaimed, 'O Allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!'[FN#279] It is also said that Omar bin al- Khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments. He rendered unto all men their due, and exceeded in his giving to them. He once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it was said to him, 'Why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man?' He answered, 'This man's father stood firm at the battle day of Ohod.'[FN#280] Al-Hasan relates that Omar once came back from foray with much money, and that Hafsah[FN#281] approached him and said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, the due of kinship!' 'O Hafsah!' replied he, 'verily Allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but not with the monies of the True Believers. Indeed, thou pleasest"" thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' And she went away trailing her skirts.[FN#282] The son of Omar said, 'I implored the Lord to show me my father one year after his death, till at last I saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'How is it with thee, O my father?' He answered, 'But for my Lord's mercy thy father surely had perished.' Then said Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""Hear, O auspicious King, the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the Apostle and other holy men. Saith Al Hasan al-Basrí,[FN#283] Not a soul of the sons of Adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure to compass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth.[FN#284] It was said of Sufyan,[FN#285] 'Can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth?' He replied, 'Yes, so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received.' Abdullah bin Shaddád, being about to die, sent for his son Mohammed and admonished him, saying, 'O my son, I see the Summoner of Death summoning me, and so I charge thee to fear Allah both in public and private, to praise Allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,<br>
<br>
'I see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * The man most pious<br>
is man happiest:<br>
In truth the fear of God is best of stores, * And God shall make<br>
the pious choicely blest.'<br>
Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""Let the King also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter."" He asked her 'What be they?'; and she answered, ""When Omar bin Abd al-Azíz[FN# 286] succeeded to the Caliphate, he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into the public treasury. So the Banu Umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister, Fátimah, daughter of Marwan, and she sent to him saying, 'I must needs speak to thee.' So she came to him by night and, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, he said to her, 'O aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thou hast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.' Replied she, 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is thine to speak first, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others.' Then said Omar, 'Of a verity Allah Almighty sent Mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him, and commissioned him as His Apostle and took him to Himself,'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixty-fifth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued thus, ""Said Omar, 'Verily Allah commissioned as His Apostle Mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of Allah and His salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him and took him to Himself, leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink. After him Abu Bakr[FN#287] the Truth teller became Caliph and he left the river as it was, doing what was pleasing to Allah. Then arose Omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like. But when Othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream, and Mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in like manner, Yezid and the Banu Marwán such as Abd al-Malik and Walíd and Sulaymán[FN#288] drew away water from the stream, and the main course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now I am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' When Fatimah heard this, she said, 'I came wishing only to speak and confer with thee, but if this be thy word, I have nothing to say to thee.' Then she returned to the Ommiades and said to them, 'Now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with Omar bin al-Khattab.'[FN#289] And it is also said that when Omar was about to die, he gathered his children round him, and Maslamah[FN#290] bin Abd al-Malik said to him, 'O Prince of the Faithful, how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector? None can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee.' Omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'O Maslamah, I have defended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall I make them miserable after my death? Of a truth my sons are like other men, either obedient to Almighty Allah who will prosper them, or disobedient and I will not help them in their disobedience. Know, O Maslamah, that I was present, even as thou, when such an one of the sons of Marwanwas buried, and I fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory! This terrified me and made me tremble, and I vowed to Allah, that if ever I came to power, I would not do such deeds as the dead man had done. I have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and I hope to die in the mercy of my Lord.' Quoth Maslamah, 'A certain man died and I was present at his burial, and when all was over I fell asleep and I saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream, walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes. He came up to me and said: 'O Maslamah, it is for the like of this that rulers should rule.' Many are the instances of this kind, and quoth one of the men of authority, 'I used to milk the ewes in the Caliphate of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz, and one day I met a shepherd, among whose sheep I saw a wolf or wolves. I thought them to be dogs, for I had never before seen wolves; so I asked, 'What dost thou with these dogs?' 'They are not dogs, but wolves,' answered the shepherd. Quoth I, 'Can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them?' Quoth he, 'When the head is whole, the body is whole.'[FN#291] Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying Allah Almighty, said three words as follows, 'O folk, make clean your inmost hearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, and abstain ye from the things of the world. Know that between us and Adam there is no one man alive among the dead. Dead are Abd al- Malik and those who forewent him, and Omar also shall die and those who forewent him.' Asked Maslamah, 'O Commander of the Faithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it a little while?' But Omar answered, 'I fear lest it be a fault about my neck on Resurrection Day.' Then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon Fatimah cried out, saying, 'Ho, Maryam! Ho, Muzahim![FN#292] Ho, such an one! Look to this man!' And she began to pour water on him weeping, till he revived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her, 'What causeth thee to weep, O Fatimah?' She replied, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before Almighty Allah, of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us. This is what made me weep.' Answered he, 'Enough, O Fatimah, for indeed thou exceedest.' Then he would have risen, but fell down and Fatimah strained him to her and said, 'Thou art to me as my father and my mother, O Commander of the Faithful! We cannot speak to thee, all of us.' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, ""Here endeth the second section of the first chapter.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixty-sixth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman said to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, ""Here endeth the second section of the first chapter. And it so happened that Omar bin Abd al-Aziz wrote to the people of the festival at Meccah as follows, 'I call Allah to witness, in the Holy Month, in the Holy City and on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage,[FN#293] that I am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you, in that I have neither commanded this nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me, nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof; and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man, for I shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress. And if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the Holy Book and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise, obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness.' He said also (Allah accept of him!), 'I do not wish to be relieved from death, because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer is rewarded.' Quoth one of authority, 'I went to the Prince of the Faithful, Omarbin Abd al-Aziz, who was then Caliph, and saw before him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury. So I said to him, 'O Commander of the Faithful, thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live. An thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house, it were well.' 'Draw near to me,' answered he: so I drew near to him and he said, 'Now as for thy saying, 'Thou beggarest thy children; provide for them and for the poor of thy household,' it is without reason; for Allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and He will be their guardian. Verily, they are like other men; he who feareth Allah, right soon will Allah provide for him a happy issue, and he that is addicted to sins, I will not up hold him in his sin against Allah.' Then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them, 'Your Father is between two things; either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter the fire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise; and your father's entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do.[FN#294] So arise and go, Allah be your helper, for to Him I commit your affairs!' Khálid bin Safwán[FN#295] said, 'Yúsuf bin Omar[FN#296] accompanied me to Hishám bin Abd al-Malik,[FN#297] and as I met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants. He alighted and a tent was pitched for him. When the people had taken their seats, I came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespoke him thus, 'May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee, O Commander of the Faithful, I have an admonition for thee, which hath come down to us from the history of the Kings preceding thee!' At this, he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'Bring what thou hast, O son of Safwan!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, one of the Kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time, to this very country and said to his companions, 'Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me?' Now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to Truth; upholders of the Right and wayfarers in its highway, and he said to him, 'O King, thou askest of a grave matter. Wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'Yes,' replied the King, and the other said, 'Dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting?' 'It is temporary,' replied the King. 'How then,' rejoined the man, 'do I see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' Quoth the King, 'Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me?' 'That thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or else robe thee in rags[FN#298] and apply thyself to obey Almighty Allah thy Lord until thine appointed hour. I will come to thee again at daybreak.' Khalid bin Safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the King had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress of his exhortation. When Hishám bin Abd al-Malik heard this, he wept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be put off, shut himself up in his palace. Then the grandees and dependents came to Khalid and said, 'What is this thou hast done with the Commander of the Faithful? Thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life!' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, addressing herself to Sharrkan, ""How many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter! Of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, speaking to Sharrkan, ""Know, O King, that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but, with length of days, O King of the age, all will be well."" There said the Kazis, ""O King, of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl! Never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives."" And they called down blessings on the King and went away. Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, ""Begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds."" So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and he commanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride. Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjects ate till they were satisfied. Moreover, Sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of Damascus and they were present, together with every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knew how to sing. And they went up to the palace in one body. When the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles, right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace; and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past before King Sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out, sat down on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights. Then Sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead;[FN#299] and she at once conceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception. On the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy. Then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, saying that he had bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge. Moreover he wrote, ""There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visit my brother Zau al-Makan and my sister Nuzhat al-Zaman. I have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me."" And he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs. Then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month, after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence. Sharrkan took it and read as follows, ""After the usual Bismillah, this is from the afflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, to his son Sharrkan. Know that, since thy departure from me, the place is become contracted upon me, so that no longer I have power of patience nor can I keep my secret: and the cause thereof is as follows. It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and course Zau al-Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards, but I, fearing for him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after. My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixty-eighth night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman wrote in his letter, ""My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month, and when I returned I found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. When I knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, O my son! but I awaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they would come back with it. Accordingly, when the palmers appeared I asked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news of them; so I donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and in sleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes."" Then he wrote in verse,<br>
<br>
""That pair in image quits me not one single hour, * Whom in my<br>
             heart's most honourable place I keep:<br>
Sans hope of their return I would not live one hour, * Without my<br>
             dreams of them I ne'er would stretch me in sleep.""<br>
<br>
The letter went on, ""And after the usual salutations to thee and thine, I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us."" When Sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister. Then he took the missive and went in with it to Nuzhat al-Zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he that she was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery. Allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeing him she said to him, ""This is thy daughter: name her as thou wilt."" Quoth he, ""It is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth.[FN#300]"" Then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once for one of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land of the Greeks. Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrath seized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhat al- Zaman and said to her, ""Whence hadst thou this jewel, O slave girl?"" When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied, ""I am thy lady, and the lady of all in thy palace! Art thou not ashamed to say to me Slave girl? I am a Queen, daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" Hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Sixty-ninth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the same father. Then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abode in amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked, O my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; and he continued, ""Tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave."" So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end, how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City, Jerusalem, and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader. When Sharrkan heard this, he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself, ""How can I have my sister to wife? By Allah, needs must I marry her to one of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, I will declare that I divorced her before consummation and married her to my Chief Chamberlain."" Then he raised his head and sighing said, ""O Nuzhat al-Zaman, thou art my very sister and I cry: 'I take refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,' for I am Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" She looked at him and knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, she wept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Verily have we fallen into mortal sin![FN#301] What shall I do and what shall I say to my father and my mother when they ask me, Whence hadst thou thy daughter?"" Quoth Sharrkan, ""It were meetest that I marry thee to my Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house, that none may know thou be my sister. This hath befallen us from Almighty Allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this Chamberlain, ere any know."" Then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him, ""What wilt thou call the girl?"" ""Call her Kuzia Fakán,""[FN#302] answered he. Then he gave the mother in marriage to the Chief Chamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child, which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed with milk and dosed with powders. Now all this occurred whilst the brother, Zau al-Makan, still tarried with the Fireman at Damascus. One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from his father, with a letter which he took and read and found therein, ""After the Bismillah know, O beloved King, that I am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me. I send thee this letter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready the monies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for I long to see her and hear her discourse; more especially because there hath come to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments. As soon as I saw them I loved them, and I wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand; for none of the Kings owneth the like of them; so I asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'I will not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus.' And I, by Allah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is but little, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation. So I agreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain in my possession. Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country; and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors; and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of Baghdad.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventieth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar son of Al-Nu'uman said in his letter, ""And send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of Baghdad."" As soon as Sharrkan knew the contents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him, ""Bring the damsel to whom I married thee;"" and when she came he showed her the letter and said, ""O my sister! what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter?"" Replied she, ""Seek advice from thyself!"" and presently added (for she yearned after her people and her native land), ""Send me together with my husband the Chamberlain, to Baghdad, that I may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold me to the merchant, and that I also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain, after setting me free."" ""Be it so,"" replied Sharrkan. Then Sharrkan took his daughter, Kuzia Fakan, and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tribute in haste, bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess and the treasure to Baghdad. He also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife. And the Chamberlain replied, ""To hear is to obey."" Moreover Sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the Chamberlain; then he bade farewell to his sister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and her husband set out for Baghdad the same night. Now it so happened that Zau al-Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheld camels and Bukhti[FN#303] dromedaries and bât-mules and torches and lanterns alight; and Zau al-Makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascus going to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of the City of Baghdad. He then asked, ""Who be the leader of the caravan?"" and they answered, ""The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science."" Thereupon Zau al-Makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land, and he said to the Stoker, ""I will join this caravan and, little by little, will journey homewards."" Quoth the Fireman, ""I would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the Holy City to Damascus, then how shall I be sure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad? But I will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object."" ""With joy and good will,"" answered Zau al-Makan. Then the Fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and, when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him. Then Zau al-Ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion, ""Do thou mount with me."" But he replied, ""Not so: I will be thy servant."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""There is no help for it but thou ride awhile."" ""'Tis well,"" quoth the Stoker; ""I will ride when I grow tired."" Then said Zau al-Makan, ""O my brother, soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee, when I come to my own folk."" So they fared on till the sun rose and,When it was the hour of the noonday sleep[FN#304] the Chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels. Then he gave the signal for departure and, after five days, they came to the city of Hamáh,[FN#305] where they set down and made a three days' halt;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-first Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they halted in the city of Hamah three days; they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city. Here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province Diyár Bakr. Here blew on them the breezes of Baghdad, and Zau al-Makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land, and how he was returning to his sire without his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and his regrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,<br>
<br>
""Sweetheart! How long must I await by so long suffering teed? *<br>
            Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide:<br>
Ah me! in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * Would<br>
            Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide!<br>
Now trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *<br>
            How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide:<br>
When say they 'Comfort take for loss of love' I but reply * 'By<br>
            Allah, till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide!' ""<br>
<br>
Thereupon said to him the Fireman, ""Leave this weeping and wailing, for we are near the Chamberlain's tent."" Quoth Zau al- Makan, ""Needs must I recite somewhat of verse; haply it may quench the fire of my heart."" ""Allah upon thee,"" cried the other, ""cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; then do what thou wilt, and I will be with thee wherever thou art."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""By Allah! I cannot forbear from this!"" Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place, and Nuzhat al-Zaman could not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept. And while she was in tears, he heard Zau al-Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,<br>
<br>
'Al-Yaman's[FN#306] leven-gleam I see, * And sore despair<br>
            despaireth me<br>
For friend who erst abode wi' me * Crowning my cup with gladdest<br>
           gree:<br>
It minds me o' one who jilted me * To mourn my bitter liberty.<br>
Say sooth, thou fair sheet lightning! shall * We meet once more<br>
           in joy and glee?<br>
O blamer! spare to me thy blame * My Lord hath sent this dule to<br>
            dree,<br>
Of friend who left me, fain to flee; * Of Time that breeds<br>
            calamity:<br>
All bliss hath fled the heart of me * Since Fortune proved mine<br>
            enemy.<br>
He[FN#307] brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * And made me drain the<br>
            dregs, did he:<br>
I see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * Ere I again shall gaze on<br>
           thee.<br>
Time! prithee bring our childhood back, * Restore our happy<br>
            infancy,<br>
When joy and safety 'joyed we * From shafts that now they shoot<br>
            at me!<br>
Who aids the hapless stranger wight, * That nights in fright and<br>
            misery,<br>
That wastes his days in lonely grief, * For 'Time's<br>
             Delight'[FN#308] no more must be?<br>
Doomed us despite our will to bear * The hands of base bores cark<br>
             and care.""<br>
<br>
When he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit. This is how it fared with him; but as regards Nuzhat al- Zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch, who said to her, ""What is thy will?"" Quoth she, ""Arise and bring me him who recited verses but now."" Replied he, ""Of a truth I did not hear him""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-second Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat Al-Zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the Chief Eunuch and said to him, ""Go, fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry!"" Replied he, ""Of a truth I heard him not and I wot him not and folks are all sleeping."" But she said, ""Whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter."" So he went, yet found none on wake save the Stoker; for Zau al-Makan was still insensible, and when his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him. Then said the Eunuch, ""Art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him?"" The Stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, he replied, ""By Allah, 'twas not I!"" Rejoined the Eunuch, ""Who then was the reciter?: point him out to me. Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake."" The Fireman feared for Zau al- Makan and said in himself, ""Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt""; so he answered, ""By Allah, I know not who it was."" Said the Eunuch, ""By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou! So needs must thou know him."" ""By Allah,"" replied the Fireman, ""I tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake; Allah requite him!"" Quoth the Eunuch, ""If thou happen upon him, point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter[FN#309] or do thou take him with thine own hand."" Said the Fireman, ""Go thou back and I will bring him to thee."" So the Eunuch left him and went his ways; and, going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her, ""None knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, some wayfarer."" And she was silent. Meanwhile, Zau al-Makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens; the breath of the dawn breeze[FN#310] breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses, when the Fire man asked him, ""What wilt thou do?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""I have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry, that I may quench therewith the fire of my heart."" Quoth the other, ""Thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint, and how I escaped death only by beguiling the Eunuch."" ""Tell me what happened,"" quoth Zau al-Makan. Replied the Stoker, ""Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an Eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, who took to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep, and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awake but myself. I told him in reply it was some passerby, some wayfarer; so he went away and Allah delivered me from him; else had he killed me. But first he said to me, 'If thou hear him again, bring him to us.'"" When Zau al-Makan heard this he wept and said, ""Who is it would forbid me to recite? I will surely recite, befal me what may; for I am near mine own land and care for none."" Rejoined the Fireman, ""Thy design is naught save to lose thy life;"" and Zau al-Makan retorted, ""Needs must I recite verses."" ""Verily,"" said the Stoker, ""needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place, albeit;I had intended not to leave thee, till I had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father. Thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught. What ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue?"" But Zau al-Makan answered, ""I will not be turned away from my purpose.""[FN#311] Then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets,<br>
<br>
""Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;<br>
          * Cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be<br>
           sped:<br>
If the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * Wi'<br>
           repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed:<br>
If the snake of the sand dunes hiss, I shall marvel not at all!<br>
           * Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the<br>
           luscious red:<br>
O Eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love: * Had I<br>
           lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead.""<br>
And he also improvised the two following distichs,<br>
<br>
""We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *<br>
           Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site:<br>
Who shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * Light<br>
            of the Place for aye conjoined with Time's<br>
            Delight?''[FN#312]<br>
<br>
And as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him. When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard the first improvisation, she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home; then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him, ""Woe to thee! He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by. By Allah, an thou fetch him not to me, I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee, and he shall beat thee and cast thee out. But take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him no hurt. If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is. Return quickly and linger not.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-third Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said, ""Beware how thou come back to me and report, I could not find him."" So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep for weariness, till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up, with his head uncovered. So he drew near and seizing him by the hand, said to him, ""It was thou didst recite the verses!"" The Fireman was afeard for his life and replied, ""No, by Allah, O chief of the people, it was not I!"" But the Eunuch said, ""I will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses, for I dread returning to my lady without him."" Now when the Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al-Makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch, ""By Allah, it was not I, and I know him not. I only heard some passer by, some wayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for I am a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem; and Abraham, the friend of Allah, be with you all."" ""Rise up and fare with me,"" rejoined the Eunuch, ""and tell my lady this with thine own mouth, for I have seen none awake save thyself."" Quoth the Stoker, ""Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where I now am, and dost thou not know my station? Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him. So go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it will be I or some one I know, and thou shalt not learn of him but by me."" Then he kissed the Eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away; but the Castrato fetched a round and, returning secretly, came and stood behind the Fireman, fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings. As soon as he was gone, the Stoker arose and aroused Zau al-Makan and said to him, ""Come, sit up, that I may tell thee what hath happened."" So Zau al-Makan sat up, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered, ""Let me alone; I will take no heed of this and I care for none, for I am mine own country.""[FN#313] Quoth the Stoker, ""Why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil? If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land. Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned. Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her? Belike, she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home, and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch to look for thee."" However Zau al-Makan paid no heed to the Fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets,<br>
<br>
""I fly the carper's injury,* Whose carping sorely vexeth me:<br>
He chides and taunts me, wotting not * He burns me but more<br>
            grievously.<br>
The blamer cries 'He is consoled!' * I say, 'My own dear<br>
            land[FN#314] to see:'<br>
They ask, 'Why be that land so dear?' * I say, 'It taught me in<br>
            love to be:'<br>
They ask, 'What raised its dignity?' * I say, 'What made my<br>
            ignomy:'<br>
Whate'er the bitter cup I drain, * Far be fro' me that land to<br>
             flee:<br>
Nor will I bow to those who blame, * And for such love would deal<br>
             me shame.<br>
<br>
Hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion, when the Eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at his head) came up to him; whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them. Then said the Eunuch to Zau al-Makan, ""Peace be with thee, O my lord!"" ""And on thee be peace,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!"" ""O my lord,"" continued the Eunuch—-And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-fourth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Eunuch said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my lord, I have sought thee these several times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her."" Quoth Zau al- Makan, ""And who be this bitch that seeketh for me? Allah curse her and curse her husband with her!""[FN#315] And he began to revile the Eunuch, who could make him no answer, because his mistress had charged him to do Zau al-Makan no hurt, nor bring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he would not accompany him, to give him the thousand diners. So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, ""O my lord, take this purse and go with me. We will do thee no upright, O my son, nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer and return in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news."" When Zau al- Makan heard this, he arose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk, stepping over them; whilst the Fireman followed after them from afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, ""Alas the pity of his youth! Tomorrow they will hang him."" And he ceased not following them till he approached their station,[FN#316] without any observing him. Then he stood still and said, ""How base it will be of him, if he say it was I who bade him recite the verses!"" This was the case of the Stoker; but as regards what befel Zau al-Makan, he ceased not walking with the Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went in to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said, ""O my lady, I have brought thee him whom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding."" When she heard this, her heart fluttered and she cried, ""Let him recite some verses, that I may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land."" Then the Eunuch went out to Zau al-Makan and said to him, ""Recite what verses thou knowest, for my lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after I will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition."" Replied he, ""With love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste. I have a story, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown, and behold, I am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought."" When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing, and said to the Eunuch, ""Ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father."" The Castrato asked as she bade him, and Zau al-Makan replied, ""Yes, I have parted from every one I loved: but the dearest of all to me was my sister, from whom Fate hath separated me."" When Nuzhat al- Zaman heard this, she exclaimed, ""Allah Almighty reunite him with what he loveth!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-fifth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat al-Zaman heard his words she said, ""Allah reunite him with what he loveth!"" Then quoth she to the Eunuch, ""Tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country."" The Eunuch did so, and Zau al-Makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets,[FN#317]<br>
<br>
""Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest? * The house<br>
            that hometh Hinda be forever blest'<br>
Her love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * Naught or<br>
           before or after can for man have zest<br>
'Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * That day<br>
           when Hinda's footstep on its face is prest:<br>
Hail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * The dearling<br>
           who en' Slaves all hearts by her behest:<br>
Allah on 'Time's Delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *<br>
           With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast.""<br>
And also these,<br>
<br>
""I vow to Allah if at home I sight * My sister Nuzhat al-Zamani<br>
           highs<br>
I'll pass the days in joyance and delight * Mid bashful minions,<br>
             maidens soft and white:<br>
To sound of harps in various modes they smite * Draining the<br>
            bowl, while eyes rain lively light<br>
'Neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * By stream<br>
            bank flowing through my garden site.""<br>
<br>
When he had finished his verse, Nuzhat al-Zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him. As soon as her eyes fell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, ""O my brother! O Zau al-Makan!"" He also looked at her and knew her and cried out, ""O my sister! O Nuzhat al-Zaman!"" Then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit. When the Eunuch saw this case, he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them, waited till they should recover. After a while they came to themselves, and Nuzhat al-Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy: oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her, and she repeated these verses,<br>
<br>
""Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * Forsworn art<br>
           Time, expiate thy sin in haste![FN#318]<br>
Comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * To him who brings<br>
           good news, rise, gird thy waist<br>
I spurned old world tales of Eden bliss; * Till came I<br>
            Kausar[FN#319] on those lips<br>
<br>
When Zau al-Makan heard this, he pressed his sister to his breast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets,[FN#320]<br>
<br>
""Long I lamented that we fell apart, * While tears repentant<br>
            railed from these eyne;<br>
And sware, if Time unite us twain once more, * 'Severance' shall<br>
            never sound from tongue of mine:<br>
Joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * Of pleasure from mine<br>
            eyes draws gouts of brine:<br>
Tears, O mine eyes, have now become your wont * Ye weep for<br>
            pleasure and you weep for pine!""<br>
<br>
They sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, ""Come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee, and I will tell thee what happened to me."" So they entered and Zau al-Maken said, ""Do thou begin thy tale."" Accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the Khan and what had happened to her with the Badawi; how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkan and had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time of buying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the King, their sire, had sent and asked for her from Sharrkan. Then quoth she, ""Praised be Allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left our father together, so together shall we return to him!"" And she added, ""Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage to this Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father. And this is what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since I left thee."" Thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end; and how Allah vouchsafed to send the Fireman to him, and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day. She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al-Makan added, ""Of a truth, O my sister, this Fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son, for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst he made me ride; and I owe my life to him."" Said she, ""Allah willing, we will requite him for all this, according to our power."" Then she called the Eunuch, who came and kissed Zau al- Makan's hand, and she said, ""Take thy reward for glad tidings, O face of good omen! It was thy hand reunited me with my brother; so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine. But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me."" The Castrato rejoiced and, going in to the Chamberlain, him to his mistress. Accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding Zau al-Makan with her, asked who he was. So she told him all that had befallen them both, first and last, and added, ""Know, O Chamberlain, that thou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken to wife the daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman for I am Nuzhat al- Zaman, and this is my brother, Zau al-Makan."" When the Chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become King Omar bin al-Nu'uman's son in law, so he said to himself, "" 'Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province.""[FN#321] Then he went up to Zau al-Makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride. Thereupon said Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""We are now near our country and I would be left alone with my brother, that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach Baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time."" ""Be it as thou biddest,"" replied the Chamberlain, and, going forth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for Zau al-Makan. Then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and Nuzhat al-Zaman said to him, ""Bid the Eunuch bring me the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden to leave us."" The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him to do accordingly; so he replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass and preparing for flight. The tears were running adown his cheeks, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan; and he was saying to himself, ""Indeed, I warned him for the love of Allah, but he would not listen to me; Oh would I knew what is become of him!"" Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Fireman turned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-sixth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying, ""Oh would I knew what is become of him!""; ere he had done speaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried, ""Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have done him! I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch (hence these pages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime."" Then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, ""Who was it recited the verses? O liar! why didst thou say, 'I never repeated these couplets, nor do I know who repeated them;' when it was thy companion? But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee."" Quoth the Fireman, ""What I feared hath befallen me."" And he repeated this couplet,<br>
<br>
""'Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning: * But unto Allah we are all returning.""<br>
<br>
Then the Eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, ""Take him off the ass."" So they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded by the pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and the Castrato said to them, ""If a hair of him be lost, you will be lost with it."" And he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him. But when the Stoker saw himself beset by the pages, he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch, said to him, ""O Chief, I am neither this youth's brother nor am I akin to him, nor is he sib to me; but I was a Fireman in a Hammam and found him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap."" Then the caravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things, whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing, but said to him, ""Thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thy self;"" and kept laughing at him the while to himself. Whenever the caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and the Castrato ate from one dish.[FN#322] Then the Eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself, gave it to the Fireman, who drank; but all the while his tears never dried, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood. So they both travelled on with the caravan, whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter, in attendance on Zau al-Makan and his sister, and now gave an eye to the Fireman; and Nuzhat al-Zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from Baghdad. Here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night.[FN#323] Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them, ""Stay, and your loading delay!""; then, mounting with his Mamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud. When they drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums and kettledrums, horsemen and footmen. The Chamberlain marvelled at this; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon said he to them, ""What is the matter and what are these troops, that ye do this with us?"" Asked they, ""Who art thou; and whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?"" and he answered, ""I am the Chamberlain of the Emir of Damascus, King Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad."" When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept, saying, ""In very sooth King Omar is dead and he died not but of poison. So fare ye forwards; no harm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir, Dandan."" Now when the Chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, ""Oh for our disappointment in this our journey!"" Then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the Wazir Dandan, who granted an interview and called a halt and, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain. Then he bade him be seated and questioned him; and he replied that he was Chamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omar with presents and the tribute of Syria. The Wazir, hearing the mention of King Omar's name, wept and said, ""King Omar is dead by poison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay one another on this account; but the notables and grandees and the four Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them. So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm. And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet, Zau Al-Makan, for, quoth they, his name be Light of the Place, and he hath a sister Nuzhat al-Zaman highs, the Delight of the Time; but they set out five years ago for Al-Hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them."" When the Chamberlain heard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of King Omar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at the arrival of Zau al-Makan, for that he would now become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-seventh Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan's Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother Zau al-Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead. So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said to him, ""Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders! Know, O Chief Wazir, that here, where you have encountered me, Allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, for that His Almighty Will restoreth to you Zau al-Makan and his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman; whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can."" When the Minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said, ""O Chamberlain, tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence."" So he repeated to him the whole story and told him that Nuzhat al-Zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of Zau al-Makan from first to last. As soon as he had ended his tale, the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and Chief Officers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance. Then they gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and did their service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; and the Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour. After this, the Chamberlain held on that day a Divan council; and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne, whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State took their places before them, according to their several ranks.[FN#324] Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank, after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them. So the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rode onwards, preceded by the standards of war. When the grandees had finished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host; and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said, ""I deem it well to ride on before you, and precede you, that I may get ready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brother Sharrkan."" ""Aright thou reckest,"" answered the Wazir Then the Chamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him, ""Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zau al-Makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities.""[FN#325] The Chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the Wazir Dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city. And they did his bidding. Then the Chamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying to himself, ""How blessed is this gurney!"", and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes, she and her brother Zau al-Makan. They made all haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant a day's journey from Baghdad, where the Chamberlain called a halt for rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the Sultan Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and, alighting at a distance from Nuzhat al-Zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence. They did so and she gave permission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother; and told them of the death of their father; and of Zau al-Makan, how the heads of the people had made him King over them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of the kingdom. They both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed; but the Chamberlain answered, ""The news rests with the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host; and it only remaineth for thee, O King, to do what they counsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan; for if thou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another Sultan. Haply he will kill thee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both."" Zau al-Makan bowed his head awhile and then said, ""I accept this position;"" for indeed there was no refusing; and he was certified that the Chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. Then he added, ""O my uncle, how shall I do with my brother Sharrkan?"" ""O my son,"" replied the Chamberlain, ""thy brother will be Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad; so take heart of grace and get ready thy case."" Zau al-Makan accepted this and the Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger[FN#326] of state, which the Wazir Dandan had brought with him; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein the Sultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees. Moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs. They did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round. After awhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of Baghdad and Khorasan, a conquering host like the full tide sea.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-eighth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan, they planted a splendid Sháhmiyánah[FN#327] befitting Kings. And as they ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host; and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad and Khorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan. And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the ""Light of the Place."" Now Zau al-Makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state: so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs, whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the Shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. Presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the Chamberlain went in to Zau al-Makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten. The Chamberlain acquainted them with the King's commands, to which they replied, ""We hear and we obey;"" and all drew up before the pavilion entrance. Then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al-Makan, whom when they saw, they were awed; but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good. So they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked Allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew. Then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; and they ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but the Wazir Dandan. Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the ground before Zau al-Makan, who rose to meet him, saying, ""Welcome, O Wazir and sire sans peer! Verily, thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the Subtle of Lere."" Then bade he the Chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto. So they came and ate and drank. Moreover the Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days' halt of the army, that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain. The Wazir obeyed the commands of the Sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said, ""This needs must be!"" He then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days. They did as he bade them and, moreover, he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the King for service during the space of three days. Then the Wazir went to the Sultan and reported all to him, and Zau al-Makan waited until nightfall, when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman and asked her, ""Dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?"" ""I have no knowledge of the cause,"" she answered, and drew a silken curtain before herself, whilst Zau al-Makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and, when he came, said to him, ""I desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"" ""Know then, O King,"" replied Dandan, ""that King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage; whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo! there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples. Then that old woman sought audience of the King, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands. I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him. And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection. They read the Koran—and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races. They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised. 'Thy father, who hath found mercy;[FN#328] looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said to them, Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Seventy-ninth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said unto King Zau al-Makan, ""Thy father, who hath found mercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them, 'Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!' Thereupon one of them came forward and, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows[FN#329] 'Know, O King, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe the Divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he stray therefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour. And know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of Allah. Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people: and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are in dignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; and indeed Monarchs need this more than the many, for the general cast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issue thereof. Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of Allah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing. Choose, therefore, thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him. If he be of the brotherhood of futurity,[FN#330] let him be zealous in observing the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its inner meaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of the world, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor a perverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend. Indeed the word, Siddík[FN#331] ('friend') deriveth from Sidk ('truth') that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this be the case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue? And know, that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it: so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast him off, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friend is not I like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, his heart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended. And Allah bless him who saith,<br>
<br>
'Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'Tis hard to win<br>
             thee back the heart offended:<br>
For hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * Like broken glass<br>
             may nevermore be mended.'<br>
<br>
The maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say, 'The best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men. It is also said, 'It behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours, health and reason.' Again it is said, 'Whoso honoureth himself, his lust is a light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his small troubles, Allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend. He who thinketh well of thee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee. He who exceedeth in contention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not on ward, is not safe from the sword. Now will I tell thee somewhat of the duties of Kazis and judges. Know, O King, that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice. Furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant; and mediation is admissible between Moslems, except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful.[FN#332] If thou shalt have done aught during the day, of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved, thou (O Kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong. Then (O judge) thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to Allah (be He extolled and exalted!). And require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put the defendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of Allah. Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses, one against other, for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals, He Himself taking charge of the inner and secret things. It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet, whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger,[FN#333] and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself, Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people.' Quoth al-Zuhri,[FN#334] 'There are three things for which, if they be found in a Kazi, he should be deposed; namely, if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he fear dismissal. And Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once deposed a Kazi, who asked him, 'Why hast thou dismissed me? It hath reached me,' answered Omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.' It is said also that Iskandar[FN#335] said to his Kazi, 'I have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding.' To his Cook he said, 'Thou art the Sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine own self.' To his Secretary he said, 'Thou art the controller of my wit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me.'""

When it was the Eightieth Night,<br>
<br>
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and, kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father, spake as follows, 'The sage Lukmán[FN#336] said to his son, 'There be three who are known only in three several cases; the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only in battle, and thy friend in time of need.' It is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed. Quoth Allah Almighty,[FN#337] 'Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty.' And he said[FN#338] (on whom be salvation and salutation!), 'Works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.' He said also, 'In the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' And this is the heart. Now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: If covetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if affliction master it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger is hard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe from discontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and if calamity overtake it, affliction betideth him. If a man gain the use of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his Lord; if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weakness causeth him to fall. Thus, in any case, nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. It was asked of a certain sage, 'Who is the most ill conditioned of men?'; and he answered, 'The man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saith the poet,<br>
<br>
Freest am I of all mankind fro' meddling wight * Who, seeing<br>
            others err, self error ne'er can sight:<br>
Riches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * Each wears<br>
            the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite:<br>
If by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * Thou shalt go<br>
            wrong and if the door be right, go right!'<br>
<br>
Continued the maiden, 'As for anecdotes of devotees, quoth Hisham bin Bashar, 'I asked Omar bin Ubayd, What is true piety?'; and he answered, 'The Apostle of Allah (to whom be salutation and salvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, The pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' And it is related that Abu Zarr[FN#339] used to say, Want is dearer to me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' Quoth one of the listeners, 'May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr!'. For my part, I say, 'Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of Almighty Allah should be content with that condition which Allah hath chosen for him.' Quoth one of the Companions of the Prophet, 'Ibn Abi Aufa[FN#340] once prayed with us the dawn prayer. When he had done, he recited, 'O Thou Enwrapped!'[FN#341] till he came to where Allah saith, 'When there shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. It is said that Sabit al-Banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes. They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'I will cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' Asked Sabit, 'In what matter?' Quoth the leach, 'In that thou leave weeping!' 'What is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined Sabit, 'if they do not weep?' Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, 'Exhort thou me!'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-first Night,<br>
<br>
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Thus spake the second hand maid to the King who hath found mercy, Omar bin al-Nu'uman. 'Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, Exhort thou me!' 'I exhort thee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in this world, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'How so?' asked the other and Mohammed answered, 'The abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' And quoth Ghaus bin Abdillah, 'There were two brothers among the sons of Israel, one of whom said to the other, 'What be the most perilous[FN#342] thing thou hast done?' Replied the brother, 'I once came upon a nest of young birds; so I took out one and threw it back into the nest; but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it. This is the most perilous thing I ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' He rejoined, 'When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward.' Now their father heard these words and exclaimed, 'O Allah, an say they sooth take them to Thyself!' It was declared by one of the wise men, 'Verily, these were of the most virtuous of children.' Quoth Sa'íd bin Jubayr,[FN#343] 'I was once in company with Fuzalah bin 'Ubaydand said to him, 'Exhort thou me!, Replied he, 'Bear in mind these two necessaries, Shun syntheism[FN#344] and harm not any of Allah's creatures.' And he repeated these two couplets,<br>
<br>
'Be as thou wilt, for Allah still is bounteous Lord, * And care<br>
            dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban<br>
To two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * Partner to<br>
            Allah trouble to thy brother man.'<br>
And how well saith the poet,<br>
<br>
'An thou of pious works a store neglect * And after death meet<br>
             one who did collect,<br>
Thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * Nor madest ready as<br>
             he did elect.'<br>
<br>
Then the third damsel came forward, after the second had with drawn, and said, 'Of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceeding wide; but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerning the pious of old. Quoth a certain holy man, 'I congratulate myself in death, though I am not assured of rest therein, save that I know death interveneth between a man and his works; so I hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works.' And Ita'a al Salami, when he had made an end of an exhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and as they asked him why he did this he answered, 'I desire to enter upon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before Almighty Allah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' In similar guise Zayn al-Abidín,[FN#345] son of Al-Husayn, was wont to tremble when he rose to pray. Being asked the cause of this, he replied, 'Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address?' It is said that there lived near Sufyán al-Thauri[FN#346] a blind man who, when the month of Ramazan came, went out with the folk to pray,[FN#347] but remained silent and hung back. Said Sufyan, 'On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of the Koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows.' Quoth Sufyan, 'Were the soul established in the heart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining for Paradise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' It is related also of Sufyan Al-Thauri that he said, 'To look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin.' Then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth, who said, 'Here am I to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me. It is related that Bishr Barefoot[FN#348] said, 'I once heard Khálid say, 'Beware of secret polytheism.' I asked, 'What may secret polytheism be?'; and he answered, 'When one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity[FN#349] come upon him.' And one of the sages said, 'Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' Quoth Ibrahim,[FN#350] 'I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries; but he said, 'O my son, this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of every hundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' Said Ibrahim, 'I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I was praying behold, Bishr was also praying: so I stood behind him[FN#351] making the prayer bow till the Mu'ezzin called his call. Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, O folk, beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal,[FN#352] and in time of need no choice we heed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good. Presently I saw Bishr drop a danik,[FN#353] so I picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which I gave him. Quoth he, 'I will not take it.' Quoth I, 'It is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'I cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world.' It is related also that Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal""[FN#354]—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-second Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to bespeak Zau al-Makan on this wise, ""And quoth the maiden to thy father, 'Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal and said to him, 'O Imam of the Faith, we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day; and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light. Is this forbidden to us?' Asked Ahmad:'Who are thou?' 'I am the sister of Bishr Barefoot,' answered she. Rejoined the Iman, 'O household of Bishr, I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts.' Quoth one of the sages, 'When Allah willeth well to His servant He openeth upon him the gate of action.' Málik bin Dinár,[FN#355] when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired, was wont to say, 'O soul, take patience, for I will not accord to thee what thou desirest.' He said also (Allah accept him!), 'The salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it.' Quoth Mansúr bin Ammár,[FN#356] 'I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards by way of Cufa, and the night was overcast, when I heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'O Allah, I swear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory, I meant not through my disobedience to transgress against Thee; for indeed I am not ignorant of Thee; but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning;[FN#357] so do Thou pardon my transgression, for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance!' When he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'O true believers, save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones.'[FN#358] Then I heard a fall, but not knowing what it was I passed on. When the morning morrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeral train, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her. I asked her of the dead, and she answered, 'This is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book of Allah Almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead.' Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said, 'I here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time. Maslamah bin Dinár used to say, 'By making sound the secret thoughts, sins great and small are covered'; and, 'when the servant of Allah is resolved to leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' Also quoth he, 'Every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is a calamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future.' It was asked of Abú Házim,[FN#359] 'Who is the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'Whoso spendeth his life in submission to Allah.' The other enquired, 'And who is the most foolish of mankind?' 'Whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others,' replied Abu Hazim. It is reported of Moses[FN#360] (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the waters of Midian he exclaimed, 'O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me.'[FN#361] And he asked of his Lord and not of his folk. There came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. When the twain returned, they informed their father Shu'ayb (on whom be peace!) who said, 'Haply, he is hungry,' adding to one of them, 'Go back to him and bid him hither.' Now when she came to Moses, she veiled her face and said, 'My father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.' Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her. Now she was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowing upon her garment[FN#362] covered the hinder cheeks to Moses; which when Moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'Get thee behind while I walk in front.' So she followed him till he entered the house of Shu'ayb where supper was ready.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-third Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Now, quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire, 'When Moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home of Shu'ayb where supper was ready, Shu'ayb said to him, 'O Moses, I desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two.' But Moses answered, 'I am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world[FN#363] for what is on earth of gold and silver.' Then quoth Shu'ayb, 'O youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' So Moses sat down and ate. Then Shu'ayb hired Moses for eight pilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters, and Moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry. As saith the Holy Writ of him, 'Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee.'[FN#364] A certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days, 'Thou hast made me desolate, for that I have not seen thee this long while.' Quoth the other, 'I have been distracted from thee by Ibn Shiháb: dost thou know him?' Quoth his friend, 'Yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years, but I have never spoken to him.' He replied, 'Verily thou forgettest Allah in forgetting—thy neighbour! If thou lovedst Allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour. Knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour,[FN#365] even as the right of kith and kin?' Said Huzayfah, 'We entered Meccah with Ibráhím bin Adham, and Shakík al-Balkhí was also making a pilgrimage that year. Now we met whilst circumambulating the Ka'abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik, 'What is your fashion in your country?' Replied Shakik, 'When we are blest with our daily bread we eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'This wise,' said Ibrahim, 'do the dogs of Balkh; but we, when blest with plenty, do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him.' And Shakik seated himself before Ibrahim and said to him, 'Thou art my master.' Also said Mohammed bin Imrán, 'A man once asked of Hátim the Deaf[FN#366] 'What maketh thee to trust in Allah?' 'Two things,' answered he, 'I know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and I know that I was not created without the knowledge of Allah, and am abashed before Him.' Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and, kissing the ground before thy father nine times, said, 'Thou hast heard, O King, what these all have spoken on the subject of piety; and I will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. It is said that the Imam al-Sháfi'í departed the night into three portions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the third for prayer. The Imam Abú Hanífah[FN#367] was wont also to pass half the night in prayer. One<br>
<br>
day a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by and remarked, 'Yonder man watcheth the whole night.' When he heard this Abu Hanifah said, 'I was abashed before Allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watch the whole night. And one of the Sages hath said,<br>
<br>
'Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep; * Who on high would hie robs his night of sleep.'<br>
<br>
Al-Rabí a relates that Al-Shafi'i used to recite the whole Koran seventy times during the month of Ramazan, and that in his daily prayers. Quoth Al-Shafi'i (Allah accept him!), 'During ten years I never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray.'[FN#368] It is reported of Abdullah bin Mohammed al-Sakrá that he said, 'I was once talking with Omar and he observed to me, 'Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquent man than Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafi'i.' It so happened I went out one day with Al-Háris bin Labíb al-Saffár, who was a disciple of Al-Muzani[FN#369] and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the Almighty, 'This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves.'[FN#370] I saw Al-Shafi'i's colour change; his skin shuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit When he revived he said, 'I take refuge with Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent! O Allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves, O Allah, of Thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of Thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of Thy Being!' Then I rose and went away. Quoth one of the pious, 'When I entered Baghdad, Al-Shafi'i was there. So I sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, there passed me one who said, 'O youth, make thy Wuzu-ablution well and Allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.' I turned and lo! there was a man behind whom came a company of people. So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. Presently, he turned and asked me, 'Say, dost thou want aught?' 'Yes,' answered I, 'I desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which Allah Almighty hath taught thee.' He said, 'Know then that whoso believeth in Allah shall be saved, and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death. Shall I tell thee any more?' I replied, 'Assuredly;' and he continued, 'Be thou of the world that is, heedless; and of the world to come, greediest. Be truthful in all thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with the Salvationists.' Then he went on and I asked about him and was told that he was the Imam Al-Shafi'i. Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, 'I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-fourth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""The old woman bespake thy sire, saying, 'The Imam Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.' He also said, 'I never disputed with any one, but I would that Almighty Allah should give him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it: nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the Truth, and I reck not whether Allah manifest it by my tongue or by His.' He said also (whom Allah accept!), 'If thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee Whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest.' It was told to Abu Hanífah that the Commander of the Faithful, Abú Ja'afar al-Mansúr, had appointed him Kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would not accept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was to be paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his head with his robe—and spoke not. When the Caliph's messenger came with the money, he went in to the Imam and accosted him, but he would not speak to him. So the messenger said, 'Verily this money is lawfully thine.' 'I know that it is lawfully mine,' replied he: 'but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart.'[FN#371] Asked the other, 'If thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them?' Answered Abu Hanifah, 'Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?' Another of Al-Shafi'i's sayings (Allah accept him!) is,<br>
<br>
'Oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * Thou shalt be wealthy<br>
           and of grace entire:<br>
Cast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * How many a death was<br>
            done by vain desire!'<br>
<br>
Among the sayings of Sufyán al-Thaurí, with which he admonished Ali bin al-Hasan al-Salami was, 'Be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride. Be not indebted save to Him who is merciful to His debtors; and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world. Be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and in beseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. Counsel every True Believer, when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith; and beware of betraying a Believer, for whoso betrayeth a Believer, betrayeth Allah and His Apostle. Avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt:[FN#372] so shalt thou be at peace. Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: so shalt thou be loved of Allah. Adorn thine inner man and Allah shall adorn thine outer man. Accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems. Draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets. Let thine affairs, both public and private, be in Allah's charge, and fear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the hands of the Lord of Dread; and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped, either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires that burn.' Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels. Now when thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour. Moreover, he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged Princess Abrizah, daughter of the King of Greece, to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed. They abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the King visited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by night and fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me, 'O Wazir, verily this old woman is of the pious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' Now on the eleventh day, the King visited her, that he might pay her the price of the damsels; but she said to him, 'O King, know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed I seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.' Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her, 'O my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'I will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast, watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all for the love of Allah Almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please.' So the King wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'Allah make this pious woman to profit us!' Then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'I will help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water.' They brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof. Lastly she covered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring, gave it to thy sire, saying, 'When thou hast fasted the first ten days, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith. As for me, tomorrow I will go forth to my brethren, the Invisible[FN#373] Controuls, for I yearn after them, and I will return to thee when the first ten days are past. Thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and put the key in his pocket. Next day the King fasted and the old woman went her ways.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-fifth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan thus continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Now when came the day for the Sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways. And after he had accomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach. Within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like no leaf of known tree. She went in to thy sire and saluted him; and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'Welcome, O pious lady!' 'O King,' quoth she, 'the Invisible Controuls salute thee, for I told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their Halwá,[FN#374] which is of the sweetmeats of the other world. Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' The King rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'Praised be Allah, who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World!' Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour. She went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said, 'Know, O King, that I told the Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee, and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee, and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee; for they were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted. So I would fain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee, to the extent of thy desires.' When thy sire heard her words, he thanked her for them and said, 'Except that I fear to cross thee, I would not accept the treasure or aught else; but when wilt thou set out with them?' Replied she, 'On the seven and twentieth night; and I will bring them back to thee at the head of the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity; and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal. By Allah, each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' He said, 'I know it, O pious lady!' Then quoth the old woman, 'There is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the Invisible Controuls.' Quoth he, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blessed with two children, a girl and a boy; but they were lost; years ago. Take her with thee that she may get the blessing'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-sixth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blest with two children, a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her with thee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, the Invisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two children may be restored to her.' 'Thou hast said well,' replied she; 'for that indeed was her grievousest want.' Thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'O my son, I am going to the Invisible Controuls; so bring me Sophia.' Accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels. Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup, presented it to the Sultan saying, 'On the thirtieth day, do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out, enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. Then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace be with thee'! Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands. Quoth she, 'I commend thee to Allah's care;' whereat quoth he, 'And when shall I see thee again, O pious lady? In very sooth I love not to part with thee.' Then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the Queen; whilst the King fasted after her departure other three days, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the Hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace, commanding that none should go in to him. There, after making fast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but he did not come out and we said, 'Perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore he sleepeth.' So we waited till next day; but still he did not come forth. Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter. But nothing came of that; so at last we lifted up the door;[FN#375] and, going in, found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken.[FN#376] When we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'Whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them; and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan, when he came to our country, seduced our Queen Abrizah; nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you. Then he[FN#377] sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts. This be no kingly deed, and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited. So do ye suspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but the cunning witch, whose name is Zat al-Dawahi. And behold, I have taken the King's wife, Sophia, and have carried her to her father, Afridun King of Constantinople. Moreover, there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the last man, nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath, save he who Cross and Belt[FN#378] worshippeth.' When we read this paper, we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us: whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught. And the troops fell out as to whom they should make Sultan; some would have thee, and others would have thy brother Sharrkan; and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month, at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan: so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee. And such is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"" Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story, Zau al- Makan and his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman wept; and the Chamberlain, who wept also, said to Zau al-Makan, ""O King, weeping will avail thee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead."" Thereupon Zau al-Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him. And the Chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour-bearers[FN#379] behind him, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in his individual stead. Then quoth King Zau al-Makan to the Minister Dandan, ""Inform me concerning my sire's treasures;"" and he replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and gave him to know of the late King's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. So Zau al-Makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""Thou continues"" in office. Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life. Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs, after which he said to the Chamberlain, ""Bring out before me the tribute of Damascus that is with thee."" So he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-seventh Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zau al- Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of Damascus; and, when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and parted them all amongst the troops, till nothing was left. And the Emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life, saying, ""Never saw we a King, who gave the like of these gifts."" Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching. So they marched for three days, till, on the fourth day, they drew near to Baghdad. When they entered the city, they found it decorated, and Zau al-Makan, the Sultan, went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst the Emirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain of Damascus stood between his hands. Then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan, acquainting him with all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded, ""As soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affair and join us with thine army, that we may turn to Holy War upon the Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour."" Then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan, ""None shall carry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him, 'If thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be Viceroy for thee in Damascus; for to this effect am I instructed by him.'"" So the Wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. Then Zau al-Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the Fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that Fireman.[FN#380] Presently Zau al-Makan went out chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to Baghdad, one of the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades. One of the damsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her that night, and she conceived by him forthright. After a while, the Wazir Dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of his brother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, and said, ""It were fitting thou go forth to meet him."" Zau al- Makan replied, ""I hear and I consent;"" and riding forth with his Grandees a day's journey from Baghdad, he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother. Next morning appeared King Sharrkan amid the army of Syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce in fight, a prow and doughty knight. As the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high, Zau al-Makan and those with him pushed forward to meet Sharrkan and his men; and when Zau al-Makan saw his brother, he desired to dismount, but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towards him.[FN#381] As soon as he reached Zau al-Makan, the new Sultan threw himself upon him, and Sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other. Then they mounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reached Baghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night, and when next morning came, Zau al- Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, and proclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia.[FN#382] They then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body. Then Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my brother, tell me thy history."" So he told him all that had befallen him from first to last, including the benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him. Asked Sharrkan, 'Hast thou requited his kindness?""; and he answered, ""O my brother! I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-eighth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan asked his brother Zau al-Makan, ""Hast thou requited the Fireman for his kindness?""; and he answered, ""O my brother, I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid and find time so to do."" Therewith Sharrkan was certified that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had told him the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the Chamberlain. She sent him back her greeting, calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia-Fakan, to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety. Where upon she praised Almighty Allah and gave him thanks. Then Sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure; and Zau al-Makan said, ""O my brother, as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have come in from all parts, we will march forth."" So he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipends and allowances. Then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of Syria, and as soon as the Arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he fared forth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host. Now the name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that of the General of the army of the Turks[FN#383] Bahram. And Zau al- Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother Sharrkan, and on his left the Chamberlain his brother-in-law. So the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was in motion. They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days (for the host was great); and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the Greeks. Then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to Constantinople. But when King Afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al-Dawahi, the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled to Baghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al-Nu'uman; and who after carrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia, had returned with them all to her native land. Now when she had been restored to her son, the King of Greece, and felt herself safe, she said to King Hardub, ""Cool thine eyes; for I have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter Abrizah, and have killed Omar bin al-Nu'uman and have brought back Sophia. So now let us go to the King of Constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces; and I will fare with thee to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, for I opine that the Moslems will not await our attack."" Said Hardub, ""Tarry thou till they draw near our country, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power."" Accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war, and, when the news of the Moslems' advance reached them, they were prepared for defence; and Zat al Dawahi had preceded them. Now when she and her son arrived at Constantinople, the King of Kings, Afridun, hearing of the approach of Hardub, King of the Greeks, came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit. So Hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered from him Queen Sophia, and had said, ""The Moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them."" Now King Afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the Moslem King. So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete, besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from all their lands, French, Germans[FN#384] and Ragusans,[FN#385] with men of Zara,[FN#386] Venetians, Genoese, and all the hosts of the Yellow Faces[FN#387]; and, when the gathering was at its full, earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude. Then Afridun, the Great King, ordered a march; so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days. They fared on till they reached the Wady highs Al-Nu'uman, a broad sided vale hard by the Salt Sea, where they halted three days; and on the fourth they were about to set out again, when news came that the army of Al-Islam on them press, and the defenders of the faith of Mohammed, of Men the Best. So they halted in it other three days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades. Presently there appeared beneath it the banners Islamitan and the ensigns Mahometan; the horsemen urged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, clad in mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil; whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each other dashed. Eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combat singular was the Wazir Dandan, he and the army of Syria, numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the General of the Turks, and the General of Daylam, Rustam and Bahram, amid twenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shores of the Salt Sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast. Then the Nazarene host called out on Jesus and Mary, and the defiled[FN#388] Cross and they heaped themselves upon the Wazir Dandan and those with him of the Syrian host. Now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman Zat al-Dawahi; for, before his departure, King Afridun had gone in to her and asked her, ""How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue?; it is thou hast caused this great distress to us;"" and she had answered, ""O great King and mighty Cohen![FN#389] I will teach thee a trick would baffle Iblis himself, though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Eighty-ninth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman, for that the King before his departure had gone to her and asked, ""How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue? it is thou hast caused this great distress to us!"" And she had answered, ""O great King and mighty Cohen, I will teach thee a trick would baffle the Devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts. It is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over the sea to the Mountain of Smoke; and there let them land and stir not till {he standards of Al-Islam come upon thee, when do thou up and at them. Then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the Moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront them from the landward. So not one of them shall escape, and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us."" Now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to King Afridun, and he replied, ""Right is the recking thou reckest, O Princess of wits and recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!"" So when the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley, before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents. Then hurried up the army of Baghdad and Khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse, with Zau al-Makan in the front of war. When the host of the Infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks; and when Zau al- Makan espied this he cried out to his men, ""Turn back to the Infidels, O People of the Chosen Apostle, and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the Compassionating, the Compassionate!"" So they turned and fought with the Christians. Then Sharrkan marched up with another corps of the Moslem host, some hundred thousand men, whilst the Infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men. When the Moslems were united, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out, saying, ""Verily Allah hath pro mised us victory, and to the Infidels hath assigned defeat."" And they clashed together with sword and spear. Now Sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword, shouting ""Allaho Akbar!"" (Allah is Most Great) till he drove back the host to the coast. Then failed the force of the foe and Allah gave victory to the faith of Al-Islam, and folk fought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of the Infidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of the Moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell. Moreover, the Lion of the Faith, King Sharrkan, and his brother, Zau al-Makan, slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come. Thus far concerning the Moslem; but as regards King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople and Sovran of Roum, and Zat Al-Dawahi, they assembled the Emirs of the host and said to them, ""Verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but our over confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us."" Then quoth to them the ancient one, the Lady of Calamities, ""In very sooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto the Messiah and put your trust in the True Belief, for, by the virtue of the Messiah, the whole strength of the Moslem host lieth in that Satan, King Sharrkan."" ""Tomorrow,"" said King Afridun, ""I have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier, Lúká bin Shamlút; for if King Sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our man will slay him and will slay the other Moslem Knights, till not one is left. And I purpose this night to sacre you all with the Holy Incense."" When the Emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him. Now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler of the Truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the Greeks used to send it to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris. Hearing of it Kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal; and the Chief Priests and the great Kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and the Patriarchs used to mix their own skite[FN#390] with it, for that the skite of the Chief Patriarch could not suffice for ten countries.[FN#391] So, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen, and King Afridun,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninetieth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and King Afridun summoned his chief Knights and Nobles and invested them with dresses of honour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows, incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the Chief Patriarch, the Cohen, the Heresiarch. This incensing done, he called for Luka bin Shamlut, surnamed the Sword of the Messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the Holy Merde, caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest. Now there was no stouter champion in the land of Roum than this accursed Luka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, for his face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was branded with the mark of the Infidels on face.[FN#392] After this he came up to King Afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; and the King said to him, ""I desire thou go out against Sharrkan, King of Damascus, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and deliver us from this affliction."" Quoth Luka, ""Hearkening and obedience;"" and the King made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from Heaven being near hand. Then Luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he bore a trident spear, as he were Iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign. Then he rode forward, he and his horde of Infidels, even as though they were driving to the Fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the Arabic tongue and saying, ""Ho, sect of Mohammed (upon whom be salutation and salvation!), let none of you come out but your champion Sharrkan, the Sword of Al-Islam, Lord of Damascus in Shám[FN#393]!"" Nor had he made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the Day of Complain. Then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was King Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. For when his brother, Zau al-Makan, saw that accursed one push out on the plain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to Sharrkan and said to him, ""Of a surety they seek for thee."" Said he, ""Should it so be, 'twere most pleasing to me."" So when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain, ""Let none of you come out against me save Sharrkan,"" they knew this cursed Luka to be champion of the land of Roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of Moslems. Now he was one of the greatest of villains, a wretch who caused hearts to pain; and the DayIamites, Turks and Kurds dreaded his might and main. Presently Sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recited these couplets,<br>
<br>
""I have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *<br>
             Shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his<br>
             main:<br>
I have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * Upon<br>
             whose shaft the dam of Death her throny seat hath ta'en:<br>
I have a trenchant glaive of Hind; and, when I bare its face * Of<br>
             scabbard"" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain.""<br>
<br>
Luka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with his hand, in honour of the Cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then he couched his throw spear and ran at Sharrkan. But first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers, hurled it at Sharrkan. It flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for Sharrkan; but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. Then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view. As it descended, he caught it again with the other hand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out from his heart core, saying, ""By the truth of Him who created the sevenfold skies, I will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise!"" Then threw he the throw spear at Luka, who thought to do as Sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight; but Sharrkan prevented him, and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the Cross, and Allah hurried his soul to the Fire and Dwelling place dire.[FN#394] But when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, ""Alas!"" and ""Woe worth the day!"" and called for aid upon the Abbots of the monasteries,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-first Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and cried, ""Alas!"" and ""Woe worth the day!"" and called upon the Abbots of the monasteries and cried, ""Where be the crosses?"" So the Religious offered up prayers and the Christians all drew together against Sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars and lances, rushed forward to the attack. Then army met army and breasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs;[FN#395] nor did the herald of-war cease calling to fight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight. So the two hosts drew apart, whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so much cut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with the slain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell. Then Sharrkan joined his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the Chamberlain and the Wazir Dandan, and said to them, ""Verily Allah hath opened a door for the Infidels to fall, praised be the Lord of the Worlds one and all!"" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""Let us never cease to praise Allah, for that He hath dispelled trouble from the Arab and the Ajam. Indeed the folk, generation after generation, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed Luka, the falsifier of the Evangel;[FN#396] of thy catching the throng spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of Allah among men thou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end of time."" Then said Sharrkan, ""Harkye, O grand Chamberlain and doughty Capitayne!"" and he answered, ""Adsum!""[FN#397] Quoth Sharrkan, ""Take with thee the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand horse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore, and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe. Then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the Infidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops falling back, as if defeated, and all the Infidels following them, as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, do ye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standard with the words, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is God's Apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then up with the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout, 'Alla ho Akbar! Allah is most Great!' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea."" He replied, ""To hear is to obey!""; and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth. Now the Chamberlain took with himself the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand men even as Sharrkan had commanded. As soon as dawned the morn, the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear. Then the Christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the Ecclesiasts[FN#398] cried out and all heads were bared, and those in the ships hoisted the Cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side, and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white; and all joined fight and the grind mill of Death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground: heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. Scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain; steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore; the host of Al-Islam called out, saying, ""On the Prince of Mankind be blessings and peace, and to the Compassionate glory and praise, which ne'er shall cease, for His boons which aye increase;"" and the host of the Infidels shouted, ""Glory to the Cross and the Belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presser and the Priests and the Monks and the Festival of Palms and the Metropolitan!"" Now Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, while the Infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout, and made ready to foin and hew. Then the meiny of the Moslems raised their voices, reciting the first verses of the Chapter of the Cow,[FN#399] whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds, and the heralds of the Greeks cried out, ""Ho, servants of the Messiah! Ho, people of the True Faith! Ho, followers of the Primate![FN#400] Verily Divine grace upon you opes; for see, the hosts of Al Islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! So turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else are ye outcasts from the Messiah, Mary's son, who spoke even when a cradled one!""[FN#401] Now Afridun, King of Constantinople, deemed that the Infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the Moslems, and sent to King Hardub of Roum congratulations on success, adding, ""Availed us naught but the Holy Merde of the Arch Patriarch, whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the Cross near and far; and I swear, by the Miracles of the Messiah; and by thy daughter Abrizah, the Nazarene, the Mariolater; and by the Waters of Baptism, that I will not leave upon the earth a single defender of Al- Islam! And to the bitter end will I carry out this plan."" So the messenger betook himself with the address to King Hardub, whilst the Infidels called to one another saying, ""Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-second Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Infidels called to one another, saying, ""Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!"" while Hardub King of Greece cried aloud, ""Ho, to our revenge for Abrizah!"" Thereupon King Zau al-Makan shouted ""Ho, servants of the Requiting King!: smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!"" So the Moslems returned to the Infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, ""Up, and at the foes of the Faith, all ye who love the Prophet Elect, with hope of salvation on the Day of Fear, to win favour of the Bountiful, the Forgiving One; for verily the Garden of Paradise is under the shadow of swords!"" And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged down upon the Infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when lo! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of Unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the Deniers, cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the Faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew. He was girt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armed with two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors, even as saith the poet,<br>
<br>
""Laud not long hair,[FN#402] except it be dispread * In two fold<br>
            locks, on day of fight and fray,<br>
O'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * From<br>
             many a whis kered knight to win the day.""<br>
And as singeth another,<br>
<br>
""I say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'For sword shall<br>
             serve those looks that sword like show!'<br>
Says he, 'My sabre looks for those I love, * My sword for those<br>
             who sweets of love unknow!'""<br>
<br>
When Sharrkan saw him, he said to him, ""I conjure thee by the Koran and the attributes of the Compassionate One, O Champion of the Champions! tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the Requiting King, whom one thing distracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling."" Then cried the Cavalier to him saying, ""Thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quickly thou hast forgotten me!"" Thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil,[FN#403] so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed, and lo! it was none other than Zau al-Makan. Then Sharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this for two reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evil eye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings. So he said to him, ""O King! thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in very sooth I fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""I desire to even thee in fray and I will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay."" Then the host of Al-Islam, heaping itself upon the Infidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right Holy War, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre. But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the Greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, when lo! there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the Minister Dandan, the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut and thrust. Nor less came forth the Emir Bahram, Lord of the Provinces of Sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; and the host of Al-Islam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm. Then a body of the Moslems turned against those who in the ships remained, and perdition on them rained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slew of them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, nor was one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale and bane. Moreover, they took their ships, with all the money and treasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the Moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears.[FN#404] Now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the Moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that Allah had given them victory and protection. Such was the case with them; but as regards the fugitive Infidels they soon reached Constantinople, whither the tidings preceded them that King Afridun had prevailed over the Moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, ""I know that my son Hardub, King of Roum, is no runagate and that he feareth not the Islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole world to the Nazarene faith."" Then she bade the Great King, Afridun, give command that the city be decorated, and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of Destiny. Now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the King of Cæsarea. So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft. Thereat the horrors of Doomday rose upon King Afridun,[FN#405] and he knew that there was no making straight their crook. Then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and cries were heard from all sides. And when King Hardub of Greece met King Afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the Moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said to him, ""Look not to see any of the army, save those who have already reached thee."" When King Afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, ""Surely the Messiah was wroth with them that he caused the Moslems to prevail over them!"" Then came the Arch Patriarch sadly to the King who said to him, ""O our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and the Messiah hath punished us!"" Replied the Patriarch, ""Grieve not nor feel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the Messiah, and all have been punished for his offence; but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that the Mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you."" After which the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, came to Afridun and said to him, ""O King, verily the Moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcome them save by wile: wherefore I purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of Al-Islam, haply I may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion, even as I slew his father. If my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land, for all are strong only because of him; but I desire to have some Christian dwellers of Syria, such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, that they may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan."" Replied the King, ""Be it so whenever thou wilt."" So she bade fetch an hundred men, natives of Najrán,[FN#406] in Sham, and the King asked them, ""Have ye not heard what hath befallen the Christians with the Moslems?"" ""Yes,"" answered they; and he rejoined, ""Know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the Messiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised as Monotheists and Mohammedans, to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the Moslem from us: say, then, are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the Anointed and I will give you a quintal of gold?[FN#407] He of you who escapeth shall have the money, and him of you who dieth will the Messiah reward."" ""O King,"" replied they, ""we will devote our lives to the Messiah, and we will be thy sacrifice."" Thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted. She waited till the decoction was cold, then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith. Moreover, she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary, and afterwards went in to King Afridun, who knew her not, nor did any of his companions know her, till she discovered herself to them: and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced and said, ""May the Messiah never fail thee!"" Thereupon she took with her the Syrian Christians, and set out for the army of Baghdad.— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-third Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Afridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear fluttered the scrotum[FN#408] below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi. Now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception; wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, red eyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangy body, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran. But she had studied the scriptures of Al-Islam and had made the Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the Mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the Koran; and she had professed Judaism in the Holy City of Jerusalem[FN#409] for two years' space, that she might master the magic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief. Now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, King Hardub of Greece, was on account of the slave virgins at his court: for she was given to tribadism[FN#410] and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her, she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron[FN#411] till she fainted away for excess of volupty. Whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode for a length of time. This was known to Marjanah and Rayhánah and Utrijah, the handmaids of Abrizah, and their Princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smell from her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. She was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions; but Abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the Omnipotent, the Omniscient; for, by Allah, right well quoth the poet,<br>
<br>
""Ho thou who grovellest low before the great * Nor over fording<br>
             lesser men dost blench<br>
Who gildest dross by dirham gathering, * No otter scent disguises<br>
             carrion stench!<br>
<br>
And now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working. Presently she departed, taking the chief Nazarenes with their hosts, and turned towards the army of the Moslems. Whereupon King Hardub went in to King Afridun and said to him, ""O King, we have no need of the Chief Patriarch nor of his prayers, but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the Moslem hosts; for these are marching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides."" When King Afridun heard this, terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, without stay or delay, to all the nations of the Nazarenes, saying, ""It behoveth none of the Messiahites or Cross knights to hold back, especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let them all come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for the Moslem hosts already tread our soil. So haste! haste ye! ere what we fear to us here appear."" Thus much concerning them; but regarding the work of the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi; when she went forth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothing of Moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of Antioch, such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth. And she had taken a letter from King Afridun to the following effect: ""These be merchantmen from the land of Sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, till they reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants a country flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of ill faith."" Then quoth the accursed Zat al-Dawahi to those with her, ""Verily I wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the Moslem."" Replied they, ""O Queen, command us whatso thou wilt; we are at thy disposal and may the Messiah never disappoint thy dealings!"" Then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shone with prodigious sheen. Now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round with cords[FN#412] just above her feet, till she drew near the Moslem camp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles. Then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and set her in a chest and, quoth she, ""Cry abroad the Refrain of Unity,[FN#413] nor fear from it aught of damage!"" Replied they, ""How can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, Zat al-Dawahi, mother of the King we glory in?"" Then said she, ""We blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evil becometh good deed. When ye have set me in the chest, take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the Moslem camp, and fear ye no blame. And if any of the Moslems hinder you, give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their King, Zau al-Makan, and implore his protection saying, 'We were in the land of the Infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote us a passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance.' If he ask you, 'What profit had ye of your property in the land of Roum?' answer him, 'We profited in the deliverance of a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. Nay, the Infidels tortured him night and day. We knew not this; but, after we had tarried in Constantinople for some time, having sold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land. We spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke, we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it, behold, it moved and said, 'O Moslems, is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the Lord of the three Worlds?'[FN#414] 'How so?' asked we; and the figure answered, 'Know that Allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent that your faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the Infidels and repair to the Moslem host; for with them wones the Sword of the Com passionate One, of our Age the Champion, King Sharrkan, by whom He shall conquer Constantinople town and destroy the sect of the Nazarene. And when ye shall have journeyed three days, you will find an hermitage known as the Hermitage of the ascetic Matruhina[FN#415] and containing a cell; visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for therein is a Religious from the Holy City, Jerusalem, by name Abdullah, and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the power of working saintly miracles[FN#416] such as dispel doubts and obscurity. Certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time. By his deliverance you will please the Lord of Faithful Men, for such release is better than fighting for the Faith.'"" Now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""As soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan, say him further, 'Hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-fourth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""Now as soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan say him further, 'Hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and Allah's servants of purest qualities; so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage, and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling, as is the wont of merchants. As soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light, we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard the holy man, after chanting some verses of the Koran, repeat the following couplets,<br>
<br>
'My heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * And sinks my<br>
            soul in sea of bale and bate<br>
Unless escape be near I soon shall die; * And Death were better<br>
             than this doleful strait:<br>
O Lightning an thou light my home and folk, * An their still<br>
             brighter charms thy shine abate,<br>
Say, what my path to meet them, being barred * By wars, and<br>
             barricado'd succour's gate?'<br>
<br>
""When once ye have brought me into the Moslem camp, and I mix with them you shall see,"" the old woman continued, ""how I will make shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the last man."" The Nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands and set her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all made for the Moslem host as hath erst been said. Such was the case with the damned hag, Zat al-Dawahi and her companions; but as regards the Mohammeden army, they indeed, after Allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse with one another and Zau al-Makan said to his brother Sharrkan, ""Verily, Allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; wherefore continue, O Sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission to Allah (be He exalted and extolled!), for I mean to slay ten Kings in blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousand Greeks and to enter Constantinople."" Replied Sharrkan, ""My life be thy ransom against death! Needs must I follow out the Holy War, though I wone many a year in their country. But I have, O my brother, in Damascus a daughter, named Kuzia Fakan, whom I love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age.' Said Zau al-Makan, ""And I also have left my wife with child and near her time, nor do I know what Allah will vouchsafe me by her. But promise me, O my brother, that if Allah bless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon."" ""With love and good will, replied Sharrkan; and, stretching out his hand to his brother, he said, If she bring thee a son, I will give him my daughter Kuzia Fakan, to wife."" At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy. And the Wazir Dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them, ""Know, O ye Kings, that Allah hath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives to Him (be He exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homes and households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him, so haply Allah shall enable us to win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch and root. If it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight."" And the Minister Dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said,<br>
<br>
""To slay my foes is chiefest bliss I wist, * And on the courser's<br>
            back be borne a list;<br>
Comes promising tryst a messenger from friend * Full oft, when<br>
            comes the friend withouten tryst.""<br>
And these words of another,<br>
<br>
""War for my mother (an I live) I'll take; * Spear for my brother;<br>
           scymitar for sire<br>
With every shag haired brave who meets his death * Smiling, till<br>
           won from Doom his dear desire!""<br>
<br>
And when the Wazir ended his verses, he said, ""Praise be to Him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold!"" Then Zau al-Makan commanded the army to depart; and they fared on forcing their marches for Constantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign, full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain. Now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were Paradise; for it had donned its adornments and decked itself.[FN#417] Gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar of Tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze. Mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,<br>
<br>
""Behold this lovely garden! 'tis as though * Spring o'er its<br>
           frame her greeny cloak had spread.<br>
Looking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * A lake whose<br>
            waters balance in their bed,<br>
But look with spirit eyes and lo! shalt see * Glory in every<br>
           leaf o'erwaves thy head.""<br>
<br>
And as another saith,<br>
<br>
""The stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * Whose down[FN#418]<br>
          is creeping shade of tamarisk stems<br>
Round legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * Silvern, and<br>
           blossoms are the diadems.""<br>
<br>
When Zau al-Makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to his brother Sharrkan and said, ""O my brother, verily in Damascus is naught the like of this place. We will not march from it save after three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of Al-Islam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed Infidels."" So they halted therein and while camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, and Zau al-Makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the Land of Syria had halted there to rest and that the Moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the Infidels. After a while up came the merchants, crying out and appealing to the King for aidance. When Zau al- Makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when in presence they said to him, ""O King, we have been in the country of the Infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do our brothers the Moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? Of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us."" Thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the King of Constantinople, and Sharrkan read it and said, ""We will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the Infidels."" Replied they, ""O our Lord, in very sooth Allah despatched us thither that we might win what Gházi[FN#419] never won the like of, not even thou in all thy razzias."" Asked Sharrkan, ""What was it ye won?"" ""O King,"" answered they, ""we will not tell thee save in private; for if this matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to the ears of some,[FN#420] and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all Moslems who resort to the land of the Greeks."" Now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned Zat al- Dawahi. So Zau al-Makan and his brother brought them to a private place, where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee, and wept till they made the two Kings weep.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-fifth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Nazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a private place by Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan, laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two Kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch Zat al-Dawahi. Thereupon Sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of Almighty Allah. So quoth he to them, ""Did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?"" Quoth they, ""We delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing for our lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death; but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price."" Then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassia pod[FN#421] for excess of blackness and leanness, and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles. When Zau al-Makan and the bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best of Allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face. So Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them and said, ""Cease this weeping and hear my words. Hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, ""Know ye both that I was content to accept what my Lord did unto me, for I kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from Him (be He exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to the delights of Paradise. I had indeed supplicated Him that I might return to my native land, not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me, but that I might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the Faith who, being slain in fray, live again without suffering death.""[FN#422] Then she repeated the following couplets,<br>
<br>
""Our Fort is Tor,[FN#423] and flames the fire of fight: * Moses<br>
            art thou and this is time for aid:<br>
Cast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * Nor dread<br>
            for men their ropes be vipers made.[FN#424]<br>
For Chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * And on their<br>
            necks 'grave versets[FN#425] wi' thy blade!""<br>
<br>
When the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light, and Sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her: but she refused it, saying, ""I have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should I break it at such a time when my Lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the Infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? I will wait till sun down."" So when it was nightfall, Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan came and served her with food and said, ""Eat, O ascetic!"" But she said, ""This is no time for eating; it is the time for worshipping the Requiting King."" Then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent; and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights, sitting not but at the time of the Salám or salutation[FN#426] ending with several prayers. When Zau al- Makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to Sharrkan, ""Cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this Religious, and appoint a body servant to wait upon him."" On the fourth day she called for food; so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt. Then she again turned to her fast and, as the night came, she rose anew to pray; when Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this Holy War, I would join myself to him and worship Allah in his service, till I came before His presence. And now I desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""And I also: tomorrow we sally forth to fight against Constantinople, and we shall find no time like the present."" Said the Wazir Dandan, ""And I no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for me that I find death in this Holy War and come to the presence of my Lord, for I am aweary of the world."" So as soon as night had darkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, Zat al-Dawahi; and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation. Then she turned to them and after wishing them long life, asked them ""Wherefore come ye?"", whereto they answered, ""O thou holy man! diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?"" She rejoined, ""To him who standeth in the presence of Allah, remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him."" Quoth they, ""We would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, for that will profit us more than the possession of Constantinople."" Now when she heard their words she said, ""By Allah, were ye not the Emirs of the Moslems, I would not relate to you aught of this at any time; for I complain not but to Allah alone. However, to you I will relate the circumstances of my captivity. Know, then, that I was in the saintly City of Jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself among them, for that Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) had endowed me with humility and abnegation, till I chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water. Then entered into me pride; whence I know not, and I said to myself, 'Who like me can walk the water?' And my heart from that time hardened and Allah afflicted me with the love of travel. So I journeyed to Roum land and visited every part for a whole year, and left no place but therein I worshiped Allah. When I came to this spot,[FN#427] I clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by a monk called Matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out and kissed my hands and feet and said, 'Verily, I have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the Greeks, and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of Al-Islam.' Then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a dark room; and, when I entered it unawares, he locked the door on me and left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it was his intent to kill me by delay. It chanced one day, that a Knight called Dakianús[FN#428] came to the hermitage, accompanied by ten squires and his daughter Tamásil, a girl whose beauty was incom parable. When they entered that hermitage, the monk Matruhina told them of me, and the Knight said, 'Bring him out, for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' So they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche, praying and reciting the Koran and glorifying Allah and humbling myself before the Almighty. When they saw me in this state Matrohina exclaimed, 'This man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me, Dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievous beating, till I desired death and reproached myself, saying, 'This is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which Allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his own competence! And thou, O my soul, verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee. Dost thou not know that pride angereth the Lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the Fire?' Then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground. Every three days, they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and every month or two the Knight came to the hermitage. Now his daughter Tamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when I first saw her, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that she had reached her four and twentieth year. There is not in our land nor in the land of the Greeks a fairer than she, and her father feared lest the King take her from him; for she had vowed herself to the Messiah and rode with Dakianus in the habit of a cavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman. And her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein; and I saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of them save Almighty Allah. Now ye are worthier of these riches than those Infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the Moslems and especially on fighters in the Holy War. When these merchants came to Constantinople and sold their merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them, by grace of a marvel which Allah granted to me; so they made for that hermitage and slew Matruhina, after torturing him with most grievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showed them the place where I was; when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death. Now tomorrow night Tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and his squires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if ye would witness these things, take me with you and I will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the Knight Dakianus which be in that mountain; for I saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom, and I heard a damsel of their company sing to them in Arabic and well-away! that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the Koran. If, then, ye will; enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of Dakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only for the King of the Age, Sharrkan, or King Zau al-Makan."" Thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the Wazir Dandan, who put scant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on his reason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face.[FN#429] Yet he was confounded at her discourse, but he feared to speak with her for awe of the King. Then quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, ""Verily, I fear lest the Knight come and, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid to enter the hermitage."" So Zau al-Makan ordered the army to march upon Constantinople and said, ""I have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage."" Then he sent at once for the Chief Chamberlain whom they brought into the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of the Turks and Daylamites and said, ""As soon as it is dawn, do ye set forth for Constantinople; and thou, O Chamberlain, shalt take my place in council and contrivance, while thou, O Rustam, shalt be my brother's deputy in battle. But let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you."" Then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-sixth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed Zat al-Dawahi, and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure. Now as soon as dawned the morn, the Chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, and they set out thinking that the two Kings and the Wazir were with them; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. Such was the case with the host, but as regards the two Kings and the Minister, they tarried in their place till the end of that day. Now the Infidels who were with Zat al-Dawahi took their departure privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march. So she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile. And when it was dark night, she arose and went in to Zau al-Makan and his companions and said to them, ""Come, let us set out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms."" They obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain, whilst the rest rode on before Zat al-Dawahi, who gained new strength for excess of joy, so that Zau al-Makan said, ""Glory be to Him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like we never saw!"" Now the witch had written a letter to the King of Constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird,[FN#430] acquainting him with what had passed and ending, ""I wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the Greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lest the host of Al-Islam get sight of them; and, when they reach the hermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till I come to them with the Moslem King and his brother, for I shall inveigle them and will bring them thither, together with the Wazir and an hundred horse and no more, that I may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage. I am resolved to slay the Monk Matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life. If my plot work well, not one of the Moslems shall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight; and Matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the Nazarene faith and the servants of the Cross, and praise be to the Messiah, first and last."" When this letter reached Constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to King Afridun, who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein. Thus far concerning them; but as regards King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan and the escort, when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the Monk Matruhina, who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth that pious man Zat al-Dawahi, ""Slay this damned fellow.""[FN#431] So they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death. Then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them; and after gathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith. As for Tamasil, she came not, she or her father, for fear of the Moslems; so Zau al-Makan tarried there, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, till Sharrkan said to him, ""By Allah, I am troubled anent the army of Al-Islam, for I know not what is become of them."" His brother replied, ""And I also am concerned for them: we have come by this great treasure and I do not believe that Tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallen the host of the Christians. It behoveth us, then, to content ourselves with what Allah hath given us and depart; so haply He will help us conquer Constantinople."" Accordingly they came down from the mountain, while Zat al-Dawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. As soon as these saw the Moslems they encircled them from all sides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and the Infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless Faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring. When Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan looked upon this host, they saw that it was a numerous army and said, ""Who can have given these troops information of us?"" Replied Sharrkan, ""O my brother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with two gates; though, by the virtue of the Lord of Arabs and Ajams, were not the place so narrow I would bring them to naught, even though they were an hundred thousand men!"" Said Zau al-Makan, ""Had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;"" and the Wazir Dandan continued, ""If we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows; but Allah will succour us against them. I know this defile and its straitness, and I know there be many places of refuge in it; for I have been here on razzia with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, what while we besieged Constantinople. We abode in this place, and here is water colder than snow. So come, let us push out of this defile ere the Infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, and we powerless to come at them."" So they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows; but the pious man, Zat al-Dawahi, looked at them and said, ""What is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselves to the Lord, and to working His will? By Allah, I abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid the Almighty in aught he did with me! Fight ye in Allah's way; so whoever of you is slain Paradise shall be his abode, and whoso slayeth, his striving shall be to his honour."" When they heard from the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the Infidels charged down from all sides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them. The Moslems fought for the service of Allah a right good fight, and wrought upon His foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst Zau al-Makan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting. Now while so doing, he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them, and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was also signing the Infidels to slay Sharrkan. So troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop that charged, he charged and drove back; and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory, and he said in himself, ""Verily on this holy men Allah looketh with eyes of His favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the Infidels with the purity of his pious intent: for I see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight."" So they battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, the Moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of them five and forty. And when they were gathered together, they sought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this was grievous to them and they said, ""Belike, he hath died a martyr."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""I saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of Holy Writ."" Now while they were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, stood before them, hending in hand the head of the Chief Captain of the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce in fight and a Satan for blight. One of the Turks had slain him with an arrow, and Allah hurried his soul to the fire; and when the Infidels saw what that Moslem had done with their leader, they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords, and Allah hurried his soul to Heaven. Then the accursed old woman cut off that Knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan. Now when Sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed, ""Praised be Allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee, O holy man and devout champion of the Religion!"" Replied she, O my son, I have sought martyrdom this day, and have thrown my life away amid the Infidel array, but they feared me with dismay. When ye dispersed, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight their leader, albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and I smote him till I severed head from trunk. Not one of the Infidels could near me; so I brought his head to you,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-seventh Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damned witch, Zat al-Dawahi, took the head of the Knight, the leader of the twenty thousand Infidels, she brought it and threw it down before Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""When I saw your condition, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight and smote him with the sword till I severed head from trunk. And none could near me, so I brought his head to you, that you may be strengthened in Holy War and work out with your swords the will of the Lord of the Faithful. And now I purpose leaving you to strive against the Infidels, whilst I go to your army, though they be at the gates of Constantinople, and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these Unfaithfuls."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""How wilt thou pass to them, O thou holy man, seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the Miscreants?"" Quoth the accursed hag, ""Allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me;[FN#432] nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attack me at that time, for I shall be as one non existing, absorbed in Allah, and He will fend off from me His foes."" ""Thou sayest sooth, O holy man,"" rejoined Sharrkan, ""for indeed I have been witness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of the night, 'twill be best for us."" Replied she, ""I will set out at this very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee. Furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain."" Sharrkan said, ""As for me I will not leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for he is the stronghold of the Moslems and the sword of the Lord of the three Worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with him the Wazir Dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs."" So after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said, ""Give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the Infidels, if they be asleep or awake."" Quoth they, ""We will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to Allah."" ""If I do your bidding,"" replied she, ""blame me not but blame yourselves; for it is my rede that you await me till I bring you tidings of the case."" Then said Sharrkan, ""Go to them and delay not from us, for we shall be awaiting thee."" Thereupon she fared forth and Sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, ""Were not this holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furious knight. This is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and of a truth the pride of the Infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn."" Now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee, behold, the accursed Zat al-Dawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the Unbelievers; wherefor they thanked her (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damned hag asked, ""Where be the King of the Age, Zau al-Makan, and the Minister Dandan?"" Answered he, ""Here am I!"" Take with thee thy Wazir,"" said she, ""and follow after me, that we may fare forth to Constantinople."" Now she had acquainted the Infidels with the cheat she had put upon the Moslems, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said, Our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their King in return for the Knight's death; because we had no stouter rider than he;"" and they added (bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the Moslems), ""When thou bringest him to us, we will bear him to King Afridun."" Then she went out and went out with her Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan, and she walked on before the two saying, ""Fare forth with the blessing of Almighty Allah!"" So they did her bidding, for the shaft of Pate and Fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the Grecian camp, till they came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst the Infidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for the infernal old woman had enjoined this. Now when Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan saw that the Infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight, the Wazir exclaimed, ""By Allah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles! and doubtless he be of the elect."" Rejoined Zau al-Makan, ""By Allah, I think the Infidels be naught but blind, for we see them and they see us not."" And while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers, behold, the Infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them, saying, ""Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him too?"" And the Wazir Dandan replied, ""See you not yon other man that is before us? ' Replied the Unbelievers, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks, and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" Then Zau Al-Makan said, ""By Allah, this is a chastisement decreed to us by Almighty Allah!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-eighth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Unfaithful had seized upon King Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan, they said to the two, ""Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him also?"" And the Wazir Dandan replied, ""See you not yon other man who be with us?"" They rejoined, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" Then the Infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night, whilst Zat al-Dawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight. So they fell to lamenting and saying to each other, ""Verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us."" So far concerning Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan; but as regards King Sharrkan, he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battle with the Infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good. Then they sallied out till they were hard upon the Unbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out to them, saying, ""O Moslems, we have taken captives your Sultan and your Wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except ye leave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our King, who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. If ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death. So we have told you sooth, and this is our last word to you."" Now when Sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the Wazir Dandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failed him and, making sure of death, he said to himself, ""Would I knew the cause of their capture! Did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him, or what was the matter?"" Then they sprang up to battle with the Unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. The brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain; for the Infidels flocked up on them, as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but Sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. And when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place; and the Moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them: few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on Allah and the scymitar. Now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest Emirs, and they had killed thousands of the Infidels, footmen and fighters on horse. When Sharrkan saw this, the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades ""What shall we do?""; whereto all answered, ""That which Almighty Allah willeth shall befal us."" On the morning of the second day, Sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop, ""If ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water; so I deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering. Haply the holy man may have reached the Moslem host, and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the Infidels, for belike the Unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him."" They said, This were the better course to take, and of its expediency no doubt we make."" So the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the Infidels who sought to enter in, they slew. Thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky and dun;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the Ninety-ninth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the army of the Moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe, and every one of the Infidels attempted to charge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, by which time King Sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left. Then quoth the Infidels to one another, ""When shall these battle days have an end? We are weary of warring the Moslems."" And quoth one of them, ""Up and at them, for there remain of them but five and twenty men! If we cannot prevail on them to fight, let us light a fire upon them;[FN#433] and if they submit themselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire. May the Messiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn of the Nazarenes be for them no abiding place!"" So they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it. Thereupon Sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners. And while they were in this condition, lo! the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter, ""It is not for any save for King Afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey with them to Constantinople and deliver them to our King, who shall deal with them as he please."" Said they, ""This is the right course;"" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them. Then, as soon as it was black night, the Infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival; and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs. Now Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan, were in confinement and so also were his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him, ""O my brother, how win free?"" ""By Allah,"" replied Zau al Makan, ""I know not; for here we be like birds in cage."" Then Sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brass asunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the Captain of the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters, freed Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the rest of his men. Then he turned to the two and said, ""I desire to slay three of these Infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that we shall be guised as Greeks and we will pass through them, with out their knowing us, and fare forth to our own force."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""This is no safe counsel for if we kill them, I fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us. 'Twere the surer way to pass out of the defile."" So they agreed upon this and set out; and, when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind, they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and Sharrkan said to his brother, ""Better we take each one of us a steed."" There were five and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses, whilst Allah sent sleep upon the Infidels for a purpose He knew and the Faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach. Meanwhile Sharrkan set to gathering from the Infidels as many weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted. And while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the Infidels supposed that anyone could release Zau al-Makan and his brother and their men; or that their prisoners had power to escape. Now when all the captives were safe from the Unfaithful, Sharrkan came up with his comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals of flame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them and said, ""Feel no fear since Allah protecteth us. I have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose."" ""What is it?"" asked they and he answered, ""I desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice, 'Allaho Akbar!' and ye add, 'The army of Al Islam is upon you! Allaho Akbar!' This wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk, but they will think that the Moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""This plan is not good; we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word; for if we cry out 'Allaho Akbar,' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape."" Rejoined Sharrkan, ""By Allah, though they should awake tis no matter, and I long that ye fall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!"" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, ""Allaho Akbar!"" And hills and trees and rocks reworded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. But when the Kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the One Hundredth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan spake thus, ""I long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naught save good can come of it."" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted, ""Allaho Akbar!""; and hills and trees and rocks re worded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. The Infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said, ""The foe is upon us, by the truth of the Messiah!"" Then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save Almighty Allah. As soon as it was dawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them, and their captains said, ""They who did this were the prisoners in our possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till ye overtake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital; and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you."" So they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. Now when Zau al-Makan saw this, he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother, ""What I feared would come, is come upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the Faith."" But Sharrkan preferred to hold his peace. Then Zau al- Makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest, shouting, ""Allaho Akbar!"" and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the Lord of Faithful Men; and while they were in this case, behold, they heard many voices voicing, ""There is no god but the God! God is most great! Salutation and salvation upon the Apostle, the Bringer of glad Tidings, the Bearer of bad Tidings!''[FN#434] So they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of Moslems who believed in one God, pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened and Sharrkan charged upon the Infidels crying out, ""There is no god but the God! God is most great! he and those with him, so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the Unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the Moslems followed them with lunge and blow; and Zau al-Makan and his comrades of the Moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the Infidel foe, and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight. Thereupon the Moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw Bahram, the captain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, the captain of the Turks, advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim. As soon as they saw Zau al-Makan, the riders dismounted and saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them, ""Rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the Moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of Unbelievers!"" Then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after Resurrection Day. Now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this. When the Emir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain, with the Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of Constantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the Moslems, with their standards and ensigns of the Faith of Unity under the dust clouds and lo! they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the Moslems chanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate One, struck their ears. Now the Infidels knew of the approach of this host through Zat al-Dawahi with her craft and whoredom,[FN#435] calumny and contrivance. And the armies of Al-Islam drew near, as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children. Then quoth the General of the Turks to the General of the Daylamites, ""O Emir, of a truth, we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls. Look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows. Indeed yon Infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a Sultan. In very sooth, we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absence of King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the illustrious Wazir Dandan. If they know of this, they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. So it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the Turks, and march them to the hermitage of Matruhina and the meadow of Malúkhiná in quest of our brothers and comrades. If thou act by my advice, it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they be hard pressed by the Infidels; and if thou act not, blame will not attach to me. But, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly, for ill suspicion is part of prudence."" The Emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned. So much for the cause of their coming; but as regards the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, as soon as she had delivered Sultan Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan into the hands of the Infidels, the foul whore mounted a swift steed, saying to the Faithless, ""I design to rejoin the Moslem army which is at Constantinople and contrive for their destruction; for I will inform them that their chiefs are dead, and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. Then will I go to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, and to my son Hardub, King of Roum, and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the Moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive."" So she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies of Bahram and Rustam advancing towards her. So she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself, ""Haply the Moslem hosts be returning, routed, from the assault of Constantinople."" However, as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed,[FN#436] and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men, but fearing for their King and comrades. When she was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running at speed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she cried out, ""Haste ye! haste ye! O soldiers of the Compassionate One, hasten to the Holy War against the hosts of Satan!"" When Bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her, ""O friend of Allah what is behind thee?"" Answered she, ""Question not of sad case and sore condition; for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of Matruhina, and designed to win their way Constantinople wards, thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the Infidels."" And the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror, adding, ""The most of them are dead, and there are but five and twenty men left."" Said Bahram, ""O holy man! when didst thou leave them?"" ""But this night,""[FN#437] replied she. He cried, ""Glory be to Allah! to Him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree! But thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by His directions.""[FN#438] Then he mounted his horse, and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us, for our Sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him."" Then they cut across the country, wide and side, night and day, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan shouting. ""There is no god but the God! Allaho Akbar! and Salutation and Salvation upon the Congratulator, the Comminator.""[FN#439] Whereupon he and his drove at the Unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrent whelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear get hold of the prowess Knights and the mountains were cloven in affright. And when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen, the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and each recognised other as hath been said before. Then they kissed the ground before the King and before his brother Sharrkan, who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave. Now thereat they marvelled and said to one another, ""Hasten we back to Constantinople, for we left our companions there, and our hearts are with them."" So they hurried departure, commending themselves to the Subtle, the All-wise, and Zau al-Makan exhorted the Moslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the following couplets,[FN#440]<br>
<br>
""Be praises mine to all praiseworthy Thee, * O Lord, who stinted<br>
            not mine aid to be!<br>
Though was I lost abroad, Thou west to me * Strongest support<br>
            which vouchsafed victory:<br>
Thou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * And slungest<br>
            con quering sword of valiancy:<br>
Thou mad'st me blest beneath Thy kingly shade, * Engraced with<br>
            generous boons dealt fain and free:<br>
Thou savedst *from every fear I feared, by aid * Of my Wazir, the<br>
            Age's noblest he!<br>
Garred us Thy grace in fight to throw the Greek, * Who yet came<br>
             back dight in War's cramoisie:<br>
Then made I feint to fly from out the fight; * But like grim lion<br>
           turning made them flee,<br>
And left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * Not with old<br>
           wine[FN#441] but Death-cup's revelry:<br>
Then came the Saintly Hermit, and he showed * His marvels wrought<br>
            for town and wold to see;<br>
When slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * In Eden bowers<br>
           wherein sweet rill-lets well.""<br>
<br>
But, when Zau al-Makan had made an end of versifying, his brother Sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the One Hundred and First Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan congratulated his brother, Zau al-Makan, on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army. Such was their case; but as regards the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, after she had foregathered with the hosts of Rustam and Bahram, she returned to the coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed, till she drew near the Moslem army that beleaguered Constantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the Chief Chamberlain. And when he saw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said, ""Welcome O pious recluse!"" Then he questioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, ""In sooth I fear for the Emir Rustam, and the Emir Bahram, for that I met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the King and his companions. Now there are but twenty thousand horse and the Unbelievers outnumber them; so I would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man."" And she cried to them, ""Haste! Haste!"" When the Chamberlain and the Moslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; but Zat al-Dawahi said to them, ""Ask aidance of Allah and bear patiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of Mohammed; and Paradise with its palaces is laid out by Allah for those who die martyrs; and needs must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the Faith."" The Chamberlain, hearing this speech of the accursed old woman, called for the Emir Bahram's brother, a knight by name Tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousand horse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once. So he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night, till he neared the Moslems. When daylight dawned, Sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of Al-Islam and said, ""If these troops which are coming upon us be Moslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these be Nazarenes, there is no gainsaying Destiny's decrees."" Then he turned to his brother, Zau al- Makan, and said, Never fear, for with my life I will ransom thee from death. If these be Mohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours; but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fight them. Yet do I long to meet the Holy Man ere I die, so I may beg him to pray that I die not save by death of martyrdom."" Whilst the twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the banners inscribed with the words, ""There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God;"" and Sharrkan cried out, ""How is it with the Moslems?"" ""All are sound and safe,"" replied they, ""and we came not but out of concern for you."" Then the Chief of the army dismounted and, kissing ground before Sharrkan, asked, ""O my lord, how be the Sultan and the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and my brother Bahram; are they all in safety?"" He answered, ""All well; but who brought thee tidings of us?"" Quoth Tarkash; ""It was the Holy Man who told us that he had met my brother Bahram and Rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the Infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but I see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious."" They questioned him, ""And how did the Holy Man reach you?""; and he replied, ""Walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girt horseman."" ""There is no doubt but that he is a Saint of Allah,"" said Sharrkan, ""but where is he now?"" They rejoined, ""We left him with our troops, the folk of the Faith, moving them to do battle with the rebels and the Faithless."" Thereat Sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked Allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the Holy Man; and commended the dead to His mercy saying, ""This was writ in the Book."" Then they set out making for Constantinople by forced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold, a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night. But Sharrkan looked at it and said, ""Verily, I fear lest this be the Infidels who have routed the army of Al-Islam for that this dust walleth the world, east and west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south."" Presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blacker than the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the Day of Doom. Horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid; so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, ""O people of the Best of Mankind,[FN#442] the lamp which shineth in darkness blind, verily the Infidels have outwitted the Moslems by guile, for they fell upon the host of the One God whilst they deemed themselves safe from the Faithless, and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the Believers in the unity of God, and deliver them from those who deny Him!"" Now when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, he kissed the Recluse's hands and feet. On like wise did his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops; except the Wazir Dandan, who dismounted not but said, ""By Allah, my heart flieth from this devotee, for I never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane. So leave him and rejoin your comrades the Moslems, for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the Lord of the Three Worlds! How often have I here made razzias with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands!"" Said Sharrkan, ""Put away from thee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this Holy Man exciting the Faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light? So slander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious.[FN#443] Look how he inciteth us to fight the foe; and, did not Almighty Allah love him, He had cast him aforetime into fearful torment."" Then Sharrkan bade bring a Nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, ""Mount, O pious man, devout and virtuous!"" But the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,<br>
<br>
""He prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * When once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good bye.""[FN#444]<br>
<br>
So the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplift her voice, chanting the Koran and praising the Compassionate One. And they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of Al-Islam, where Sharrkan found the Moslem in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight, whilst the sword of Greece havoc dight among the Faithful, the righteous and those who work upright,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the One Hundred and Second Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan saw the Moslems in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of this weakness among the Moslems was that the accursed old woman, Zat al- Dawahi, the foe of the Faith, after seeing that Bahram and Rustam had set forward with their troops to join Sharrkan and his brother Zau al-Makan, repaired to the camp of the Mahometans before Constantinople and caused the mission of the Emir Tarkash, as hath been before said. In this her purpose was to divide the Moslem forces the better to weaken them. Then she left them and entered Constantinople, and called with a loud voice on the knights of the Greeks, saying, ""Let me down a cord that I may tie thereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your King Afridun, that he may read it and to my son King Hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding."" So they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following: ""From the terriblest of tribulations[FN#445] and the chiefest of all calamities, Zat al-Dawahi, to King Afridun greeting. But afterwards, of a truth I have contrived a device for destroying the Moslems; so bide ye quiet and content. I have cozened and captured their Sultan and the Wazir Dandan; and then I returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung. And I have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering Constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the Emir Tarkash to succour the capitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man; for, verily the Messiah looketh down upon you and the Blessed Virgin favoureth you; and I hope of the Messiah that he forget not what deed I have done."" When her letter came to King Afridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once for King Hardub of Greece, son of Zat al-Dawahi, read the letter to him as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said, ""See my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the Day of Dread."" Rejoined Afridun, ""May the Messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!"" Then he bade the Knights give orders for sallying outside the city, and the news was noised abroad in Constantinople. So the Nazarenes and the cohorts of the Cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies, and blaspheming the Lord of all Creatures. When the Chamberlain saw the sally, he said, ""Behold, the Greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our Sultan is far away; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of King Zau al-Makan!"" Therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, ""Ho, soldiers of Al-Islam and favourers of the True Faith, an you flee you are lost, but if ye stand fast, ye win! Know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the Almighty is able to make it straight; Allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain!"" Thereupon the Moslems cried out, ""Allaho Akbar!"" and the believer in the One God shouted his slogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore. The priests and monks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting the Crucifixes, while the Moslem shouted out the professions of the Requiting King and verses of the Koran began to sing. The hosts of the Compassion are One fought against the legions of Satan; and head flew from body of man, while the good Angels hovered above the people of the Chosen Prophet, nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. Now the miscreants had encompassed the Moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them; and the Faithless greeded for victory over the Faithful until day dawned and dazzled. There upon the Chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting thee Allah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post. And heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail and fled; and the Judge of death judged and sentence sped, so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain. Then the Moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent; and the Greek took possession of some of their tents; whereupon the Moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight, when meanwhile behold, up came Sharrkan with the rest of the host of Al-Islam and the standards of the Believers in Unity. And having come up with them, he charged the Infidels; and followed him Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Emirs Bahram and Rustam with his brother Tarkash. When the foe saw this, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous Believers joined their pious comrades. Then Sharrkan accosted the Chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he in turn gave the Prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day. Thereat the Moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to Allah in their Fight for the Faith. But when the Idolaters beheld the standards Mohammedan and there on the profession of Faith Islamitan, proclaiming the Unity, they shrieked ""Woe!"" and ""Ruin!"" and besought succour of the Patriarchs of the Monasteries. Then fell they to calling upon John and Mary and the Cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter, whilst King Afridun went up to consult King Hardub of Greece, for the two Kings stood one at the head of each wing, right and left. Now there was with them also a famous cavalier, Lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out in battle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. Meanwhile, the Moslems aligned their forces and thereupon Sharrkan came to his brother, Zau al-Makan, and said, ""O King of the Age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also the object of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one half of life wrought."" Replied the Sultan, ""As thou wilt, O companion of good counsel!"" ""It is my wish,"" added Sharrkan, ""to stand in mid line opposite the Infidel, with the Wazir Dandan on my left and thee on my right, whilst the Emir Bahram leads the dexter wing and the Emir Rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, O mighty King, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, for that thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after Allah, is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee."" Zau al-Makan thanked him therefor, and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus, behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of Roum; and, as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords. Her housings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of Cash mere stuff, and on her back sat a Shaykh, an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool. He stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the Moslem and said, ""I am an ambassador to you all, and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safe conduct and permit of speech, that I communicate to you my message."" Replied Sharrkan, ""Thou art in safety: fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance."" Thereupon the old man dismounted and, taking the Cross from his neck, placed it before the Sultan and humbled himself with much humility. Then quoth to him the Moslems, ""What is with thee of news?""; and quoth he, ""I am an ambassador from King Afridun, for I counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the Compassionate One; and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith to you, 'Verily, I will ransom my army with my life; so let the Moslem King do as I do and with his life ransom his host. And if he kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of Roum, and if I kill him, there will be no stability with the Moslems."" When Sharrkan heard this he said, ""O monk, I agree to that, for it is just nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, I will meet him in duello and do with him derring do, for I am Champion of the Faithful even as he is Champion of the Faithless; and if he slay me, he will have won the day and naught will remain for the Moslems forces save flight. So return to him, O thou monk, and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye."" So the monk returned (and he rejoicing) to King Afridun and King Hardub, and told them both what Sharrkan had said, whereat King Afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and he said to himself, ""No doubt but this Sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when I shall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered."" Now Zat al-Dawahi had written to King Afridun of that and had told him how Sharrkan was a Knight of the Braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him; but Afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow. So when he heard the report of the monk that Sharrkan agreed to the duello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him. The Infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing; and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade. And behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of purest strain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain. And that Knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight. On his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of Khalanj wood,[FN#446] the curious work of the Frank, weighing a quintal. Then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, ""Whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me not right soon[FN#447] shall ken who I be. I am Afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened Shawáhi,[FN#448] Zat al-Dawahi."" But he had not ended speaking ere Sharrkan, the Champion of the Moslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered Indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore. He crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and he cried out to Afridun, ""Woe to thee, O accursed! dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain?"" Then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drew together and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lunge of lance. Of the two armies looking on, some said, ""Sharrkan is victor!"" and others, ""Afridun will conquer!""; and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan. Then cried out King Afridun to Sharrkan, saying, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble. I ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a Prince; for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave;[FN#449] and see! they bring thee out a charger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return to the fight. But by the truth of my Faith, thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and I am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee; and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approve to the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt."" When Sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turned towards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse, when lo! Afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at Sharrkan. Now when the Moslem turned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed Infidel; so he wheeled round in haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved from it, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow. The weapon grazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, for Sharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away. Thereat the accursed Afridun was joyful, thinking he had slain him; and shouted to the Infidels bidding them rejoice, whereat the Faithless were encouraged and the Faithful wept. When Zau al-Makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him. Thereupon the Infidels drove at the Moslems; the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of Al-Yaman did good work. Now the first to reach Sharrkan was the Wazir Dandan,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the One Hundred and Third Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau al-Makan saw that the accursed Infidel had struck with javelin his brother Sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatched cavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the Wazir Dandan and the Emir of the Turks, Bahram, and the Emir of the Daylamites, Rustam. They found him falling from his horse; so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother, Zau al-Makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages, and went again to do the work of cut and thrust. So the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay. So they called a truce and each army returned to its tents, whilst all the Infidels repaired to King Afridun and kissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over Sharrkan. Then the King fared for Constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when King Hardub came to him and said, ""May the Messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother, Zat al-Dawahi, shall pray for thee! Know that the Moslems can make no stay without Sharrkan."" Replied Afridun, ""To morrow shall end the affair when to fight I fare: I will seek Zau al-Makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail."" Such was the case with the Kafirs; but as regards the host of Al-Islam, when Zau al-Makan returned to his tent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into the pavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon he summoned for counsel the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and Bahram. When they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine Sharrkan, and they wept and said, ""The world will not readily afford his like!"" and they watched by him all that night, and about the later hours came to them the Recluse in tears. When Zau al-Makan saw him, he rose in honour; and the Religious stroked Sharrkan's wound with his hand, chanting somewhat of the Koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the Compassionate One. And the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and, opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake. At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, saying, ""Of a truth the blessing of the Holy Man hath taken effect on him!"" And Sharrkan said, ""Praised be Allah for recovery; indeed, I am well at this hour. That accursed one played me false; and, but that I swerved aside lighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through my breast. So praised be Allah for saving me! And how is it with the Moslems?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""All are weeping for thee."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""I am well and in good case; but where is the Holy Man?"" Now he was sitting by him and said, ""At thy head."" So the Prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, ""O my son! Be of good patience and Allah shall increase thy reward; for the wage is measured by the work."" Sharrkan rejoined, ""Pray for me,"" and he prayed for him. As soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen, the Moslems sallied out to the plain and the Kafirs made ready to thrust and cut. Then the Islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight, and King Zau al-Makan and Afridun made to charge one at other. But when Zau al-Makan fared forth into the field, there came with him the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Bahram, saying, ""We will be thy sacrifice."" He replied, ""By the Holy House and Zemzem and the Place![FN#450] I will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses."" And when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing. Presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out, ""Where is Afridun, that I may make him taste the cup of disgrace?"" But when King Hardub saw the case he conjured Afridun not to attack him, saying, ""O King, yesterday it was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day. I care naught for his prowess."" So he rushed out towards Zau al-Makan brand in hand and under him a stallion like Abjar, which was Antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,<br>
<br>
""On the glancing racer outracing glance * He speeds, as though he<br>
            would collar Doom:<br>
His steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * And likest Night in<br>
            her nightliest gloom:<br>
Whose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * Like thunders<br>
             rolling in thun d'rous boom:<br>
If he race the wind he will lead the way, * And the lightning<br>
             flash will behind him loom.''[FN#451]<br>
<br>
Then each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event. At last Zau al-Makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon Hardub, King of Cæsarea,[FN#452] and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot. When the Infidels saw this, they charged in a body, compact and united, upon Zau al-Makan, who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining, till blood ran in rills. Then the Moslems cried out, ""Allaho Akbar!"" (God is most Great) and ""There is no god but the God!"", and invoked salvation for the Prophet, the Bringer of Glad Tidings, the Bearer of Bad Tidings. And there befel a great fight, but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat to the Faithless. The Wazir Dandan shouted, ""Take your blood revenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!""; and bared his head and cried out to the Turks. Now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him as men, when the Faithless found naught to save their lives but flight. So they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the Moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folk also were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock was great. Then the Greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault; and in fine the Moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory, and King Zau al-Makan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case. So he made a prostration of thanks to the Bountiful and the Exalted; and then he came forward and gave Sharrkan joy of his recovery. Answered he, ""Verily we are all under the benediction of this Religious, holy and righteous, nor would you have been victorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the Moslems.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the One Hundred and Fourth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zau al- Makan went in to his brother Sharrkan, he found him sitting with the Holy Man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery. Answered he, ""Verily we are all under the benediction of this Recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the Moslems. I found strength return to me, when I heard your 'Allaho Akbar,' for then I knew you to be victorious over your enemies. But now recount to me, O my brother, what befel thee."" So he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed Hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of Allah; and Sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess. When Zat al-Dawahi heard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee), her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears: she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the Moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy. But she said to herself, ""By the truth of the Messiah, there remaineth no profit of my life, if I burn not his heart for his brother, Sharrkan, even as he hath burned my heart for King Hardub, the mainstay of Christendom and the hosts of Crossdom!"" Still she kept her secret. And the Wazir Dandan and King Zau al-Makan and the Chamberlain remained sitting with Sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, ""To morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege."" Then said Sharrkan to them, ""Ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up."" They accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained with Sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman Zat al-Dawahi. He talked with her through part of the night, then he stretched himself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead. Such was the case with Sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, looking at Sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. Thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock. Then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to Sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body. And once more she sprang to her feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cut off their heads also, lest they should awake. Then she left the tent and made for the Sultan's pavilion, but finding the guards on the alert, turned to that of the Wazir Dandan. Now she found him reading the Koran and when his sight fell upon her he said, ""Welcome to the Holy Man!"" Hearing this from the Wazir, her heart trembled and she said, ""The reason of my coming hither at this time is that I heard the voice of a saint amongst Allah's Saints and am going to him."" Then she turned her back, but the Wazir said to himself, ""By Allah, I will follow our Devotee this night!"" So he rose and walked after her; but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was following her: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself, ""Unless I serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me."" So she turned and said to him from afar, ""Ho, thou Wazir, I am going in search of this Saint that I may learn who he is; and, after learning this much, I will ask his leave for thee to visit him. Then I will come back and tell thee: for I fear thine accompanying me, without having his permission, lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society."" Now when the Wazir heard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left her and returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. Presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself, ""I will go to Sharrkan and chat with him till morning."" But when he entered into Sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food. At this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing the blood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing. Then the noise awoke the Sultan, who enquired what was the matter, and it was said to him, ""Sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered."" So he rose in haste and entered the tent, and found the Wazir Dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head. Thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for a while, till he came to himself, when he looked at Sharrkan and wept with sore weeping, while the Wazir and Rustam and Bahram did the like. But the Chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm. Then said Zau al-Makan, ""Know ye who did this deed and how is it I see not the Devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?"" Quoth the Wazir, ""And who should have been the cause of this affliction, save that Devotee, that Satan? By Allah, my heart abhorred him from the first, because I know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!"" And he repeated to the King the tale of how he would have followed the Religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before Him who is ever near, Him who ever answereth prayer, supplicating that He would cause the false Devotee who denied Allah's testimony to fall into their hands. Then they laid Sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the One Hundred and Fifth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they laid Sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues. Then they looked for the opening of the city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. But King Zau al-Makan said, ""By Allah, I will not turn back from them, though I sit here for years and years, till I take blood revenge for my brother Sharrkan and waste Constantinople and kill the King of the Nazarenes, even if death overcome me and I be at rest from this woeful world!"" Then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the Monastery of Matruhina; and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him. Moreover, he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them, ""Do ye send supplies to your households, for I am resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till I have taken man bote for my brother Sharrkan, even if I die in this stead."" And when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied, ""To hear is to obey!"" Thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, and acquaint them saying, ""We are encamped before Constantinople and we will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years, we will not depart hence till we take it."" Moreover, he bade the Wazir Dandan write to his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, and said to him, ""Acquaint her with what hath befallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that, when I went out to war, my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as I have heard say, hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news."" Then he gave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out at once; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages. After they had departed, Zau al-Makan turned to the Wazir Dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls. So the troops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereat they marvelled, while Zau al-Makan was troubled at the case, for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother Sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the Ascetic. In this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone. So far concerning the Moslems; but as regards the Greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this. As soon as Zat al-Dawahi had slain Sharrkan, she hastened her march and reached the walls of Constantinople, where she called out in the Greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope. Quoth they, ""Who art thou?""; and quoth she, ""I am Zat al- Dawahi."" They knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she went in to the King Afridun and said to him, ""What is this I hear from the Moslems? They say that my son King Hardub is slain."" He answered, ""Yes;"" and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made Afridun and all who were present weep with her. Then she told the King how she had slain Sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoiced and thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son. Said she, ""By the truth of the Messiah, I will not rest content with killing that dog of the Moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a King of the Kings of the age! Now there is no help for it but that I work some guile and I contrive a wile whereby to slay the Sultan Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of Al-Islam; for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of Sharrkan's head; no, never!"" Then said she to King Afridun, ""Know, O King of the Age, that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my Girdle and to break the Crosses."" Replied Afridun, ""Do what thou desire; I will not gainsay thee in aught. And if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing; for though the Moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness."" Then the Accursed One (when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) took ink case and paper and wrote thereon: ""From Shawahi, Zat al- Dawahi, to the host of the Moslems. Know ye that I entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand I slew your King Omar bin al-Nu'uman in the midst of his palace. Moreover, I slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave, many of your men; and the last I killed were Sharrkan and his servants. And if fortune do not stay me and Satan obey me, I needs must slay me your Sultan and the Wazir Dandan, for I am she who came to you in disguise of a Recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits. Wherefore, an you would be in safety after this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarry here years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us. And so peace be yours!"" After writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for King Hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called a Knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the Moslem camp. When this was done, she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship after him, ""Nothing will serve me but I must kill Zau al-Makan and all the nobles of Al-Islam."" Such was the case with her; but as regards what occurred to the Moslems, all passed three days in trouble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound. So they waited till he had shot it among them and the Sultan bade the Wazir Dandan take the missive and read it. He perused it accordingly; and, when Zau al-Makan heard it to end and understood its purport, his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy; and the Minister Dandan said, ""By Allah, my heart shrank from her!"" Quoth the Sultan, ""How could this whore play her tricks upon us twice? But by the Almighty I will not depart hence till I fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of Constantinople."" And he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping. But when Zat al-Dawahi arrived amongst the Infidels and related to them her adventures at length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of Sharrkan. There upon the Moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the Sultan promised his men that, if it should be taken, he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts. But he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. Presently the Wazir Dandan came in to him and said, ""Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come, and there is no profit in this mourning. How well saith the poet,<br>
<br>
""Whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * What is to<br>
             be without a failure shall become;<br>
Soon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * And Folly's<br>
             brother[FN#453] shall abide forlorn and glum.""<br>
<br>
Wherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms."" He replied, ""O Wazir, my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects."" Thereupon the Wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of Constantinople for a length of days. And they being thus, behold, news arrived from Baghdad, by one of the Emirs to the effect that the King's wife had been blessed with a boy, and that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had named him Kánmákán.[FN#454] Moreover, that the boy bid fair to be famous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; and that she had commanded the Olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise; furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyed abundant rains, and that his comrade the Fireman was established in all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him. And she ended with the greeting of peace. Then quoth Zau al- Makan to the Wazir Dandan, ""Now is my back strengthened for that I have been blest with a son whose name is Kanmakan.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the One Hundred and Sixth Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child, Zau al- Makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, ""Now is my back strengthened, for that I have been blessed with a son[FN#455] whose name is Kanmakan."" And he spake to the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""I am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the Koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account."" Quoth the Wazir, ""Thy design is good."" Thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the Koran; and some began reciting the Holy volume; whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of Allah, and thus they did till the morning. Then Zau al-Makan went up to the grave of his brother Sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, and improvised these couplets,<br>
<br>
""They bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * With Moses'<br>
         shrieks what day o'erhead shook Tor;[FN#456]<br>
Till reached the grave which Pate had made his home, * Dug in<br>
           men's souls who one sole God adore:<br>
Ne'er had I thought before to see my joy * Borne on the bier<br>
           which heads of bearers bore:<br>
Ah no! nor ere they homed thee in the dust * That stars of<br>
           heaven earth ever covered o'er.<br>
Is the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * Where light and<br>
            splendour o'er thy face shall pour?<br>
Praise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * Cribbed and<br>
           confined he shall dispread the more!""<br>
<br>
When Zau al-Makan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe, and the Wazir repeated the words of the poet,<br>
<br>
""Pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * Thou<br>
            didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done<br>
Leftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * Ah, may<br>
            th' ex change secure thee every benison!<br>
Thou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * For us to<br>
            baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun.<br>
I see this world is only cheat and vanity, * Where man naught<br>
           else must seek but please the Truthful One:<br>
Th' Empyrean's Lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * And wi'<br>
            thy faithful friends The Guide show goodly wone:<br>
I bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * Seeing the<br>
             West in woe for lack of Easting Sun.""<br>
<br>
<br>
When the Wazir Dandan had finished his reciting, he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls. Then came forward one who had been of Sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops, and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting the following pentastichs,<br>
<br>
<br>
""Where gone is Bounty since thy hand is turned to clay? * And I<br>
             in misery lie since thou west ta'en away.<br>
See'st not, O litter guide[FN#457] (Heaven keep thee glad and<br>
             gay!), * How tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles<br>
             fray?<br>
                        A sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with<br>
                        dismay.[FN#458]<br>
By Allah ne'er this heart within I spoke of thee; * Ah no! nor<br>
             dared my sight to see thy brilliancy:<br>
Save that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * Yea!<br>
             and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,<br>
                        May yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see.""<br>
<br>
<br>
And when the man stinted reciting, Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after which all retired to their tents, and the King turning to the Wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign. On this wise the two passed days and nights, while Zau al-Makan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, ""I long to hear stories and adventures of Kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love; haply Allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay my weeping and wailing."" Quoth the Wazir, ""If naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of Kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and so forth, this thing were easy, for I had no other business, in the lifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him. This very night I will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast be broadened."" When Zau al-Makan heard these words from the Minister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night, that he might hear what the Wazir Dandan had to tell of the Kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before. And hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was in presence, he summoned the Wazir Dandan, and the Emirs Rustam and Bahram and Tarkash and the Grand Chamberlain; then waited till the whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to the Minister and said, ""Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" Replied the Wazir, ""With joy and good will.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.<br>
<br>
When it was the One Hundred and Seventh Night,<br>
<br>
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau Al-Makan summoned the Wazir and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram, he turned towards the Minister Dandan and said, ""Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" Replied the Wazir, ""With love and gladness! Know, O auspicious King, that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair, a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch Jacob[FN#459]; and it is as follows"":<br>
<br>
<b>Footnotes:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#138</i>] This knightly tale, the longest in the Nights (xliv.— cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in the Bres. Edit. Lane, who finds it ""objectionable,"" reduces it to two of its episodes, Azíz-cum-Azízah and Táj al-Mulúk. On the other hand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240) ""Scharkan, Conte Arabe,"" etc. Traduit par M. Asselan Riche, etc. Paris: Dondey-Dupré. 1829. It has its longueurs and at times is longsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison between the chivalry of Al-Islam and European knight-errantry. Although all the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in the early crusading days. Cæsarea, the second capital of Palestine, taken during the Caliphate of Omar (A.H. 19) and afterwards recovered, was fortified in A.H. 353 = 963 as a base against the Arabs by the Emperor Phocas, the Arab. ""Nakfúr"" i.e. Nicephorus. In A.H. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plundering merchantmen between Egypt and Syria, to which allusion is found in the romance. But the story teller has not quite made up his mind about which Cæsarea he is talking, and M. Riche tells us that Césarée is a ""ville de la Mauritanie, en Afrique"" (p. 20).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#139</i>] The fifth Ommiade Caliph reign. A.H. 65-86 = 685-704.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#140</i>] This does not merely mean that no one was safe from his wrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is a reminiscence of the masterful ""King Kulayb,"" who established game-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach his camp-fire. Moreover the Jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers, but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him to take advantage of the heat.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#141</i>] China.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#142</i>] The Jaxartes and the Bactrus (names very loosely applied).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#143</i>] In full ""Sharrun kána"" i.e. an evil (Sharr) has come to being (kána) that is, ""bane to the foe"" a pagan and knightly name. The hero of the Romance ""Al-Dalhamah"" is described as a bitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#144</i>] This is a Moslem law (Koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowed from the Talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wife unless he can carnally satisfy her. Moreover he must distribute his honours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless she herself give it up. This was the case even with the spouses of the Prophet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wives waived their rights in favour of one another M. Riche kindly provides the King with la piquante francaise (p. 15).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#145</i>] So the celebrated mosque in Stambul, famed for being the largest church in the world is known to the Greeks as ""Agia (pron. Aya) Sophia"" and to Moslems as ""Aye Sofíyeh"" (Holy Wisdom) i.e. the Logos or Second Person of the Trinity (not a Saintess). The sending a Christian girl as a present to a Moslem would, in these days, be considered highly scandalous. But it was done by the Mukaukis or Coptic Governor of Egypt (under Heraclius) who of course hated the Greeks. This worthy gave two damsels to Mohammed; one called Sírín and the other Máriyah (Maria) whom the Prophet reserved for his especial use and whose abode is still shown at Al-Medinah. The Rev. Doctor Badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of an epistle by Mohammed to this Mukaukis, written in the Cufic character ( ? ?) and sealed ""Mohammed, The Apostle of Allah."" My friend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon this subject opinions will differ. It is, however, exceedingly interesting, beginning with ""Bismillah,"" etc., and ending (before the signature) with a quotation from the Koran (iii. 57); and it may be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by a Prophet who had become virtually ""King of Arabia.""<br>

[<i>FN#146</i>] This prayer before ""doing the deed of kind"" is, I have said, Moslem as well Christian.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#147</i>] Exodus i. 16, quoted by Lane (M. E., chaps. xxvii.).<br>
Torrens in his Notes cites Drayton's ""Moon-calf':—<br>
            Bring forth the birth-stool—no, let it alone;<br>
            She is so far beyond all compass grown,<br>
            Some other new device us needs must stead,<br>
            Or else she never can be brought to bed.<br>
It is the ""groaning-chair"" of Poor Robin's Almanac (1676) and we find it alluded to in Boccaccio, the classical sedile which according to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat) ever since the days of Pope Joan, when it has been held advisable for one of the Cardinals to ascertain that His Holiness possesses all the instruments of virility. This ""Kursí al-wiládah"" is of peculiar form on which the patient is seated. A most interesting essay might be written upon the various positions preferred during delivery, e.g. the wild Irish still stand on all fours, like the so-called ""lower animals."" Amongst the Moslems of Waday, etc., a cord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holds on to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receives the child.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#148</i>] Some Orientalists call ""lullilooing"" the trilling cry, which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch and breaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with the tongue-tip, others ""Ziraleet"" and Zagaleet, and one traveller tells us that it began at the marriage-festival of Isaac and Rebecca (!). Arabs term it classically ""Tahlíl"" and vulgarly ""Zaghrutah"" (Plur. Zaghárit) and Persians ""Kil."" Finally in Don Quixote we have ""Lelilies,"" the battle-cry of the Moors (Duffield iii. 289). Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the good missionary heard it at the festival of Jagannath. (Pilgrimage iii. 197 )<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#149</i>] i.e. ""Light of the Place"" (or kingdom) and ""Delight of the<br>
Age.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#150</i>] It is utterly absurd to give the old heroic Persian name Afridun or Furaydun, the destroyer of Zohák or Zahhák to a Greek, but such anachronisms are characteristic of The Nights and are evidently introduced on purpose. See Boccaccio, ix. 9.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#151</i>] Arab. ""Yunán"" lit. Ionia, which applies to all Greece, insular and continental, especially to ancient Greece.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#152</i>] In 1870 I saw at Sidon a find of some hundreds of gold<br>
""Philippi"" and ""Alexanders.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#153</i>] M. Riche has (p. 21), ""Ces talismans travaillés par le ciseau du célèbre Califaziri,"" adding in a note, ""Je pense que c'est un sculpteur Arabe.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#154</i>] This periphrase, containing what seems to us a useless negative, adds emphasis in Arabic.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#155</i>] This bit of geographical information is not in the Bull<br>
Edit.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#156</i>] In Pers. = a tooth, the popular word.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#157</i>] This preliminary move, called in Persian Nakl-i Safar, is generally mentioned. So the Franciscan monks in California, when setting out for a long journey through the desert, marched three times round the convent and pitched tents for the night under its walls.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#158</i>] In Arab. ""Khazinah"" or ""Khaznah"" lit. a treasure, representing 1,000 ""Kís"" or purses (each=£5). The sum in the text is 7,000 purses X 5=£35,000.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#159</i>] Travellers often prefer such sites because they are sheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents; but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#160</i>] Arab ""Ghábah"" not a forest in our sense of the word, but a place where water sinks and the trees (mostly Mimosas), which elsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growth and collect in thickets. These are favourite places for wild beasts during noon-heats.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#161</i>] At various times in the East Jews and Christians were ordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the Zunnár or girdle.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#162</i>] The description is borrowed from the Coptic Convent, which invariably has an inner donjon or keep. The oldest monastery in the world is Mar Antonios (St. Anthony the Hermit) not far from Suez. (Gold Mines of Midian, p. 85.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#163</i>] ""Dawáhí,"" plur. of Dáhiyah = a mishap. The title means ""Mistress of Misfortunes"" or Queen of Calamities (to the enemy); and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name, which is pronounced Zát al-Dawáhí.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#164</i>] Arab. ""Kunfuz""=hedgehog or porcupine.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#165</i>] These flowers of speech are mere familiarities, not insults. In societies where the sexes are separated speech becomes exceedingly free. ""Étourdie que vous êtes,"" says M. Riche, toning down the text.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#166</i>] Arab. ""Zirt,"" a low word. The superlative ""Zarrát"" (fartermost) or, ""Abu Zirt"" (Father of farts) is a facetious term among the bean-eating Fellahs and a deadly insult amongst the Badawin (Night ccccx.). The latter prefer the word Taggáa (Pilgrimage iii. 84). We did not disdain the word in farthingale=pet en air.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#167</i>] Arab. ""kicked"" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of the shovel-stirrup. I avoid such expressions as ""spurring"" and ""pricking over the plain,"" because apt to give a wrong idea.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#168</i>] Arab. ""Allaho Akbar!"" the classical Moslem slogan.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#169</i>] Arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quite safe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#170</i>] ""Batrík"" (vulg. Bitrík)=patricius, a title given to<br>
Christian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the Tarkhan (or<br>
Nobb) heading four thousand, and the Kaumas (Arab. Káid) two<br>
hundred. It must not be confounded with Batrak (or<br>
Batrik)=patriarcha. (Lane's Lex.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#171</i>] Arab. ""Kázi al-Kuzát,"" a kind of Chief Justice or Chancellor. The office wag established under the rule of Harun al Rashid, who so entitled Abú Yúsuf Ya'akab al-Ansári: therefore the allusion is anachronistic. The same Caliph also caused the Olema to dress as they do still.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#172</i>] The allusion is Koranic: ""O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that He first created you of the dust of the ground (Adam), afterwards of seed"" (chaps. xxii.). But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposes that the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (chaps Ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two (chaps. Ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and Dímnah) says:— ""Man's seed, falling into the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female, towards her belly."" (P. 262, Mr. L G.N. Keith- Falconer's translation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran chaps. vii.), ""Thy Lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;"" and the commentators say that Allah stroked Adam's back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on God and were dismissed to return whence they came."" From this fiction it appears (says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the Mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. The poets call this Yaum-i-Alast = the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)? which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated ""Art thou not with thy Lord ?"" (Alasta bi Rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their Creator.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#173</i>] The usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#174</i>] In Eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. So Ajax fell on his back with Ulysses on his breast. (Iliad xxxii., 700, etc.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#175</i>] So biting was allowed amongst the Greeks in the , the final struggle on the ground.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#176</i>] Supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. ""Kayim"" (not El-Kim as Torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or ""professor"" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets with easy tricks. (Lane, M. E., chaps. xx.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#177</i>] Lit. ""laughed in his face"" which has not the unpleasant meaning it bears in English.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#178</i>] Arab. ""Abu riyáh""=a kind of child's toy. It is our ""bull-roarer"" well known in Australia and parts of Africa.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#179</i>] The people of the region south of the Caspian which is called ""Sea of Daylam."" It has a long history; for which see D'Herbelot, s.v. ""Dilem.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#180</i>] Coptic convents in Egypt still affect these drawbridges over the keep-moat.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#181</i>] Koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry women taken in war after the necessary purification although their husbands be still living. This is not permitted with a free woman who is a True Believer. I have noted that the only concubine slave-girl mentioned in the Koran are these ""captives possessed by the right hand.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#182</i>] The Amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is an ornament to poetry from the Iliad to our modern day. Such heroines, apparently unknown to the Pagan Arabs, were common in the early ages of Al-Islam as Ockley and Gibbon prove, and that the race is not extinct may be seen in my Pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sister of Ibn Rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#183</i>] And Solomon said, ""O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne ?"" A terrible genius (i.e. an If rit of the Jinn named Dhakwan or the notorious Sakhr) said, "" I will bring it unto thee before thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for I am able to perform it, and may be trusted"" (Koran, xxvii. 38-39). Balkís or Bilkís (says the Durrat al-Ghawwás) daughter of Hozád bin Sharhabíl, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of Al- Yaman, according to some murdered her husband, and became, by Moslem ignorance, the Biblical "" Queen of Sheba."" The Abyssinians transfer her from Arabian Saba to Ethiopia and make her the mother by Solomon of Menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for their royalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses in the world are of yesterday. The dates of the Tabábi'ah or Tobbas prove that the Bilkis of history ruled Al-Yaman in the early Christian era.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#184</i>] Arab. ""Fass,"" fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; also applied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. In The Nights it is used to signify ""a fine gem.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#185</i>] This prominence of the glutæi muscles is always insisted upon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. In Somali land where the people are sub- steatopygous, a rich young man, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up in line and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#186</i>] The ""bull"" is only half mine.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#187</i>] A favourite Arab phrase, the ""hot eye"" is one full of tears.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#188</i>] i.e., ""Coral,"" coral branch, a favourite name for a slave-girl, especially a negress. It is the older ""Morgiana."" I do not see why Preston in Al-Haríni's ""Makamah (Séance) of Singar"" renders it pearls, because Golius gives ""small pearls,"" when it is evidently ""coral."" Richardson (Dissert. xlviii.) seems to me justified in finding the Pari (fairy) Marjan of heroic Persian history reflected in the Fairy Morgain who earned off King Arthur after the battle of Camelon.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#189</i>] Arab. ""'Ud Jalaki""=Jalak or Jalik being a poetical and almost obsolete name of Damascus.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#190</i>] The fountain in Paradise whose water shall be drunk with ""pure"" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). It is so called because it comes from the ""Sanam"" (Sanima, to be high) boss or highest ridge of the Moslem Heaven (Koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27). Mr. Rodwell says ""it is conveyed to the highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise."" (?)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#191</i>] This ""hysterical"" temperament is not rare even amongst the bravest Arabs.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#192</i>] An idea evidently derived from the Æolipyla (olla animatoria) the invention of Hero Alexandrinus, which showed that the ancient Egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#193</i>] Kuthayyir ibn Abi Jumah, a poet and far-famed Ráwí or Tale-reciter, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan he lived at Al-Medinah and sang the attractions of one Azzah, hence his soubriquet Sáhib (lover of) Azzah. As he died in A. H. 105 (=726), his presence here is a gross anachronism the imaginary Sharrkan flourished before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwán A. H. 65-86.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#194</i>] Jamíl bin Ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary with<br>
Al-Kuthayrir.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#195</i>] Arab. ""Tafazzal,"" a word of frequent use in conversation=""favour me,"" etc.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#196</i>] The word has a long history. From the Gr. or is the Lat. stibium; while the Low Latin ""antimonium"" and the Span. Althimod are by metathesis for Al-Ithmid. The dictionaries define the substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but the Arabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour which enters into the veins of the eyes and gives them Iynx-like vision. The famous Anz nicknamed Zarká (the blue eyed) of Yamámah (Province) used it; and, according to some, invented Kohl. When her (protohistoric) tribe Jadis had destroyed all the rival race of Tasm, except Ribáh ibn Murrah; the sole survivor fled to the Tobba of Al-Yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. The king commanded his Himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birnam wood). Zarká from her Utum, or peel-tower, saw the army three marches off and cried, ""O folk, either trees or Himyar are coming upon you!"" adding, in Rajaz verse:—<br>
<br>
I swear by Allah that trees creep onward, or that Himyar beareth somewhat which he draweth along!<br>
<br>
She then saw a man mending his sandal. But Jadis disbelieved; Cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vessels were found full of Ithmid. Hence Al-Mutanabbi sang:<br>
<br>
""Sharper-sighted than Zarká of Jau"" (Yamámah).<br>
<br>
See C. de Perceval i. 101; Arab. Prov. i. 192; and Chenery p. 381.<br>
(The Assemblies of Al-Hariri; London, Williams and Norgate, 1867).<br>
I have made many enquiries into the true nature of Ithmid and<br>
failed to learn anything: on the Upper Nile the word is=Kohl.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#197</i>] The general colour of chessmen in the East, where the game is played on a cloth more often than a board.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#198</i>] Arab. ""Al-fil,"" the elephant=the French fol or fou and our bishop. I have derived ""elephant"" from Píl (old Persian, Sansk. Pilu) and Arab. Fil, with the article Al-Fil, whence the Greek the suffix—as being devoted to barbarous words as Obod-as (Al Ubayd), Aretas (Al-Háris), etc. Mr. Isaac Taylor (The Alphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of ""eleph-ant or ox-like (!) beast of Africa."" Prof. Sayce finds the word al-ab (two distinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (Indian) elephant, on the black obelisk of Nimrod Mound, and suggests an Assyrian derivation.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#199</i>] Arab. ""Shaukat"" which may also mean the ""pride"" or ""mainstay"" (of the army).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#200</i>] Lit. ""smote him on the tendons of his neck."" This is the famous shoulder-cut (Tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (Kalam), formed, and still forms, the staple of Eastern attack with the sword.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#201</i>] Arab. ""Dirás."" Easterns do not thresh with flails. The material is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud in the open air and threshed by different connivances. In Egypt the favourite is a chair-like machine called ""Norag,"" running on iron plates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. Generally, however, Moslems prefer the old classical , the Tribulum of Virgil and Varro, a slipper-shaped sled of wood garnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharp fragments of flint or basalt. Thus is made the ""Tibn"" or straw, the universal hay of the East, which our machines cannot imitate.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#202</i>] These numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but they were possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle of Saffayn the Caliph Ali is said to have cut down five hundred and twenty-three men in a single night.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#203</i>] Arab. ""Bika'á"": hence the ""Buka'ah"" or Clesyria.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#204</i>] Richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) which modern priggism finds ""unscientific "" wonderfully derives this word from Arab. ""Khattáf,"" a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. It is an evident corruption of ""captivus"" through Italian and French<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#205</i>] These periodical and fair-like visitations to convents are still customary; especially amongst the Christians of Damascus.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#206</i>] Camphor being then unknown.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#207</i>] The ""wrecker"" is known all over the world; and not only barbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of the shore<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#208</i>] Arab. ""Jokh"": it is not a dictionary word, but the only term in popular use for European broadcloth.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#209</i>] The second person plural is used because the writer would involve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#210</i>] This part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to the European, is perfectly intelligible to all Orientalists. You may read many an Eastern letter and not understand it. Compare Boccacoo iv. 1.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#211</i>] i.e. he was greatly agitated<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#212</i>] In text ""Li-ajal a al-Taudi'a,"" for the purpose of farewelling, a low Egyptianism; emphatically a ""Kalám wáti."" (Pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#213</i>] In the Mac. Edit. Sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#214</i>] The Farsakh (Germ. Stunde) a measure of time rather than distance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, a meile=three English stat. miles. The word is still used in Persia its true home, but not elsewhere. It is very old, having been determined as a lineal measure of distance by Herodotus (ii. 5 and 6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 to the stat. mile). Strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades (each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to 6,000 yards. Captain Francklin (Tour to Persia) estimates it = about four miles. (Pilgrimage ii. 113.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#215</i>] Arab. ""Ashhab."" Names of colours are few amongst semi civilised peoples, but in Arabia there is a distinct word for every shade of horseflesh.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#216</i>] She had already said to him ""Thou art beaten in everything!""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#217</i>] Showing that she was still a Christian.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#218</i>] This is not Badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongst wild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settled Arabs honour between men and women is unknown and such ""hocussing"" would be held quite fair.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#219</i>] The table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned tray with glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and, perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. During the Caliphate the ""wine-service"" was on a larger scale.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#220</i>] Here the ""Bhang"" (almost a generic term applied to hellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. Yet there are varieties of Cannabis, such as the Dakha of South Africa capable of most violent effect. I found the use of the drug well known to the negroes of the Southern United States and of the Brazil, although few of their owners had ever heard of it.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#221</i>] Amongst Moslems this is a reference to Adam who first ""sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called "" Safíyu'llah,"" the Pure of Allah. (Pilgrimage iii. 333.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#222</i>] Meaning, an angry, violent man.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#223</i>] Arab. ""Inshád,"" which may mean reciting the verse of another or improvising one's own. In Modern Egypt ""Munshid"" is the singer or reciter of poetry at Zikrs (Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv.). Here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by the hapless Princess.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#224</i>] The negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear, concupiscence and other mental emotions.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#225</i>] He compares her glance with the blade of a Yamani sword, a lieu commun of Eastern poetry. The weapons are famous in The Nights; but the best sword-cutlery came from Persia as the porcelain from China to Sana'á. Here, however, is especial allusion as to the sword ""Samsam"" or ""Samsamah."" It belonged to the Himyarite Tobba, Amru bin Ma'ad Kurb, and came into the hands of Harun al-Rashid. When the Emperor of the Greeks sent a present of superior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the Caliph, in the presence of the Envoys, took ""Samsam"" in hand and cut the others in twain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to the edge of ""Samsam.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#226</i>] This touch of pathos is truly Arab. So in the ""Romance of Dalhamah"" (Lane, M. E. xxiii.) the infant Gundubah sucks the breast of its dead mother and the King exclaims, ""If she had committed this crime she would not be affording the child her milk after she was dead.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#227</i>] Arab. ""Sadda'l-Aktár,"" a term picturesque enough to be preserved in English. ""Sadd,"" I have said, is a wall or dyke, the term applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs the navigation of the Upper Nile, the lilies and other growths floating with the current from the (Victoria) Nyanza Lake. I may note that we need no longer derive from India the lotus-llily so extensively used by the Ancient Egyptians and so neglected by the moderns that it has well nigh disappeared. All the Central African basins abound in the Nymphæa and thence it found its way down the Nile Valley.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#228</i>] Arab. ""Al Marhúmah"": equivalent to our ""late lamented.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#229</i>] Vulgarly pronounced ""Mahmal,"" and by Egyptians and Turks ""Mehmel."" Lane (M. E. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and I have sketched and described it in my Pilgrimage (iii. 12).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#230</i>] For such fits of religious enthusiasm see my Pilgrimage (iii. 254).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#231</i>] ""Irák"" (Mesopotamia) means ""a level country beside the banks of a ever.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#232</i>] ""Al Kuds,"" or ""Bays al-Mukaddas,"" is still the popular name of Jerusalem, from the Heb. Yerushalaim ha-Kadushah (legend on shekel of Simon Maccabeus).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#233</i>] ""Follow the religion of Abraham"" says the Koran (chaps. iii. 89). Abraham, titled ""Khalílu'llah,"" ranks next in dignity to Mohammed, preceding Isa, I need hardly say that his tomb is not in Jerusalem nor is the tomb itself at Hebron ever visited. Here Moslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of Europe to close and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially to Jews and Christians. The tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault or cave under the Mosque.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#234</i>] Abá, or Abáyah, vulg. Abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat's or camel's; too well known to require description.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#235</i>] Arab. ""Al-Wakkád,"" the man who lights and keeps up the bath-fires.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#236</i>] Arab. ""Má al-Khaláf"" (or ""Khiláf"") a sickly perfume but much prized, made from the flowers of the Salix Ægyptiaca.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#237</i>] Used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#238</i>] i.e., ""Thou art only just recovered.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#239</i>] To ""Nakh"" is to gurgle ""Ikh! Ikh!"" till the camel kneels. Hence the space called ""Barr al-Manákhah"" in Al-Medinah (Pilgrimage i. 222, ii. 91). There is a regular camel vocabulary amongst the Arabs, made up like our ""Gee"" (go ye!), etc. of significant words worn down.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#240</i>] Arab. ""Laza,"" the Second Hell provided for Jews.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#241</i>] The word has been explained (vol. i. 112).[<i>see Volume 1, note 199</i>] It is trivial, not occurring in the Koran which uses ""Arabs of the Desert ;"" ""Arabs who dwell in tents,"" etc. (chaps. ix. and xxxiii.). ""A'arábi"" is the classical word and the origin of ""Arab"" is disputed. According to Pocock (Notæ Spec. Hist. Arab.): ""Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah, which is part of the region of Tehama (belonging to Al-Medinah Pilgrimage ii. 118), which their father Ismail afterwards inhabited."" Tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of Al Hijaz, the Moslems Holy Land; and its ""Arabah,"" a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the Dead Sea. The derivation of ""Arab"" from ""Ya'arab"" a fancied son of Joktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called ""Eretz Ereb"" (or ""Arab"")=land of the West; but in Arabic ""Gharb"" (not Ereb) is the Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#242</i>] ""When thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off if thou can, or kiss it,"" wisely said Caliph al-Mansur.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#243</i>] The Tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the Northern Arabs and shown in old prints. In modern Egypt the term is applied to the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regular Dervishes. Burckhardt (Proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high cap of felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called Dely or Delaty. In Dar For (Darfour) ""Tartur"" is a conical cap adorned with beads and cowries worn by the Manghwah or buffoon who corresponds with the Egyptian ""Khalbús"" or ""Maskharah"" and the Turkish ""Sutari."" For an illustration see Plate iv. fig. 10 of Voyage au Darfour par Mohammed El Tounsy (The Tunisian), Paris, Duprat, 1845.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#244</i>] The term is picturesque and true; we say ""gnaw,"" which is not so good.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#245</i>] Here, meaning an Elder, a Chief, etc.; the word has been almost naturalised in English. I have noted that Abraham was the first ""Shaykh.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#246</i>] This mention of weighing suggests the dust of Dean Swift and the money of the Gold Coast It was done, I have said, because the gold coin, besides being ""sweated"" was soft and was soon worn down.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#247</i>] Fem. of Nájí (a deliverer, a saviour)=Salvadora.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#248</i>] This, I have noted, is according to Koranic command (chaps. iv. 88). ""When you are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation."" The longer answer to ""Peace be with (or upon) thee! "" is still universally the custom. The ""Salem"" is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observant traveller will easily make of it a Shibboleth.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#249</i>] The Badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fear that he has kidnapped a girl of family.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#250</i>] These examinations being very indecent are usually done in strictest privacy. The great point is to make sure of virginity.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#251</i>] This is according to strict Moslem law: the purchaser may not look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought to manage matters through an old woman.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#252</i>] Lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in Hindustani it means simply anger.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#253</i>] i.e. Heaven forbid I be touched by a strange man.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#254</i>] Used for fuel and other purposes, such as making ""doss stick.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#255</i>] Arab ""Yaftah'Allah"" the offer being insufficient. The rascal is greedy as a Badaw and moreover he is a liar, which the Badawi is not.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#256</i>] The third of the four great Moslem schools of Theology, taking its name from the Imam al-Sháfi'í (Mohammed ibn Idrís) who died in Egypt A.H. 204, and lies buried near Cairo. (Sale's Prel. Disc. sect. viii.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#257</i>] The Moslem form of Cabbala, or transcendental philosophy of the Hebrews.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#258</i>] Arab. ""Bakh"" the word used by the Apostle to Ali his son-in-law. It is the Latin ""Euge.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#259</i>] Readers, who read for amusement, will do well to ""skip"" the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#260</i>] There are three Persian Kings of this name (Artaxerxes)<br>
which means ""Flour and milk,"" or ""high lion."" The text alludes to<br>
Ardeshir Babegan, so called because he married the daughter of<br>
Babak the shepherd, founder of the Sassanides in A.D. 202. See<br>
D,Herberot, and the Dabistan.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#261</i>] Alluding to the proverb, ""Folk follow their King's faith,""<br>
""Cujus regio ejus religio"" etc.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#262</i>] Second Abbaside, A.H. 136-158 (=754-775).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#263</i>] The celebrated companion of Mohammed who succeeded Abu Bakr in the Caliphate (A.H. 13-23=634-644). The Sunnis know him as Al-Adil the Just, and the Shiahs detest him for his usurpation, his austerity and harshness. It is said that he laughed once and wept once. The laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate his dough-gods (the idols of the Hanifah tribe) in The Ignorance. The tears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his baby daughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dust from his hair and beard. Omar was doubtless a great man, but he is one of the most ungenial figures in Moslem history which does not abound in genialities. To me he suggests a Puritan, a Covenanter of the sourest and narrowest type; and I cannot wonder that the Persians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#264</i>] The austere Caliph Omar whose scourge was more feared than the sword was the - author of the celebrated saying ""Consult them (feminines) and do clear contrary-wise.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#265</i>] Our ""honour amongst thieves.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#266</i>] The sixth successor of Mohammed and founder of the Banu Umayyah or Ommiades, called the ""sons of the little mother"" from their eponymus (A.H. 41-60=661-680). For his Badawi wife Maysun, and her abuse of her husband, see Pilgrimage iii. 262.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#267</i>] Shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, Banu Tamím and a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, ""Sire of the Sea.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#268</i>] This is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: however much the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent. The axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pile causes itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. At first vellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. The pecten is shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which more presently. The body-pile is removed by ""Takhfíf""; the Libán Shámi (Syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from Scio, is melted and allowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over the face and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots (Burckhardt No. 420). Not a few Anglo-Indians have adopted these precautions<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#269</i>] This Caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man of awe-inspiring aspect. Omar used to look at him and say, ""This is the Cæsar of the Arabs,"" while his wife called him a ""fatted ass.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#270</i>] The saying is attributed to Abraham when ""exercised"" by the unkindly temper of Sarah; ""woman is made hard and crooked like a rib;"" and the modern addition is, ""whoso would straighten her, breaketh her.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#271</i>] i.e. ""When ready and in erection.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#272</i>] ""And do first (before going in to your wives) some act which may be profitable unto your souls"" or, for you: soul's good. (Koran, chaps. ii. 223.) Hence Ahnaf makes this prayer.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#273</i>] It was popularly said that ""Truth-speaking left Omar without a friend."" Entitled ""The Just"" he was murdered by Abu Lúlúah, alias Fírúz, a (Magian ?) slave of Al-Maghírah for denying him justice.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#274</i>] Governor of Bassorah under the first four Caliphs. See<br>
D'Herbelot s.v. ""Aschári.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#275</i>] Ziyad bin Abi Sufyan, illegitimate brother of the Caliph<br>
Mu'awiyah afterwards governor of Bassorah, Cufa and Al-Hijaz.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#276</i>] The seditions in Kufah were mainly caused by the wilful nepotism of Caliph Othman bin Asákir which at last brought about his death. His main quality seems to have been personal beauty: ""never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was the most comely of men:"" he was especially famed for beautiful teeth which in old age he bound about with gold wire. He is described as of middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy of thigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. His face inclined to yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curly hair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. He is called ""writer of the Koran"" from his edition of the M.S., and ""Lord of the two Lights"" because he married two of the Prophet's daughters, Rukayyah and Umm Kulthum; and, according to the Shi'ahs who call him Othman-i-Lang or"" limping Othman,"" he vilely maltreated them. They justify his death as the act of an Ijmá' al-Muslimín, the general consensus of Moslems which ratifies ""Lynch law."" Altogether Othman is a mean figure in history.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#277</i>] ""Nár"" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from its connection with Gehenna. You say, e.g. ""bring me a light, a coal (bassah)"" etc.; but if you say ""bring me fire! "" the enemy will probably remark ""He wanteth fire even before his time!"" The slang expression would be ""bring the sweet."" (Pilgrimage i. 121.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#278</i>] Omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and very ruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald and grey. He had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio with reddish ends. In stature he overtopped the people and was stout as he was tall. A popular saying of Mohammed's is, ""All (very) long men are fools save Omar, and all (very) short men are knaves save Ali."" The Persians, who abhor Omar, compare every lengthy, ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, ""This road never ends, like the entrails of Omar."" We know little about Ali's appearance except that he was very short and stout, broad and full-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, his long beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between his shoulders. He was a ""pocket. Hercules,"" and incredible tales, like that about the gates of Khaybar, are told of his strength. Lastly, he was the only Caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his ""Cantiloquium"" is famous and he has left more than one mystical and prophetic work. See Ockley for his ""Sentences"" and D'Herbelot s. D. ""Ali"" and ""Gebr."" Ali is a noble figure in Moslem history.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#279</i>] The emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or it may mean a holy death.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#280</i>] Battle fought near Al-Medinah A.D. 625. The word is derived from ""shad"" (one). I have described the site in my Pilgrimage, (vol. ii. 227).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#281</i>] ""Haphsa"" in older writers; Omar's daughter and one of Mohammed's wives, famous for her connection with the manuscripts of the Koran. From her were (or claimed to be) descended the Hafsites who reigned in Tunis and extended their power far and wide over the Maghrib (Mauritania), till dispossessed by the Turks.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#282</i>] i.e. humbly without the usual strut or swim: it corresponds with the biblical walking or going softly. (I Kings xxi. 27; Isaiah xxxviii. 15, etc.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#283</i>] A theologian of the seventh and eighth centuries.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#284</i>] i.e. to prepare himself by good works, especially alms-giving, for the next world.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#285</i>] A theologian of the eighth century.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#286</i>] Abd al-Aziz was eighth Ommiade (regn. A.H. 99=717) and the fifth of the orthodox, famed for a piety little known to his house. His most celebrated saying was, "" Be constant in meditation on death: if thou bein straitened case 'twill enlarge it, and if in affluence 'twill straiten it upon thee."" He died. poisoned, it is said, in A.H 101,<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#287</i>] Abu Bakr originally called Abd al-Ka'abah (slave of the Ka'abah) took the name of Abdullah and was surnamed Abu Bakr (father of the virgin) when Mohammed, who before had married only widows, took to wife his daughter, the famous or infamous Ayishah. ""Bikr"" is the usual form, but ""Bakr,"" primarily meaning a young camel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (Lane's Lex. s. c.). The first Caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the Meccan chiefs. He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep set eyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures of Henna and Katam for his beard. The Persians who hate him, call him ""Pir-i-Kaftár,"" the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wanders about the deserts of Arabia in perpetual rut which the males must satisfy.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#288</i>] The second, fifth, sixth and seventh Ommiades.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#289</i>] The mother of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz was a granddaughter of<br>

<br>
[<i>FN#291</i>] So the Turkish proverb ""The fish begins to stink at the head.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#292</i>] Calling to the slaves.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#293</i>] When the ""Day of Arafat"" (9th of Zú'l-Hijjah) falls upon a Friday. For this Hajj al- Akbar see my Pilgrimage iii. 226. It is often confounded by writers (even by the learned M. Caussin de Perceval) with the common Pilgrimage as opposed to the Umrah, or "" Lesser Pilgrimage"" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). The latter means etymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house as opposed to 'Ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is applied to visiting Meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but not at the Pilgrimage-season. Hence its title ""Hajj al-Asghar"" the ""Lesser Hajj."" But ""Umrah"" is also applied to a certain ceremony between the hills Safá (a large hard rock) and Marwah (stone full of flints), which accompanies the Hajj and which I have described (ibid. iii. 344). At Meccah I also heard of two places called Al-Umrah, the Greater in the Wady Fátimah and the Lesser half way nearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#294</i>] A fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religious systems virtually inculcate Here a pious father leaves his children miserable to save his own dirty soul.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#295</i>] Chief of the Banú Tamín, one of the noblest of tribes, derived from Tamím, the uncle of Kuraysh (Koreish); hence the poets sang:—<br>
<br>
             There cannot be a son nobler than Kuraysh,<br>
             Nor an uncle nobler than Tamím.<br>
<br>
The high minded Tamín is contrasted with the mean-spirited Kays, who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning one absolutely inconsistent, ""Art thou now Tamín and then Kays?""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#296</i>] Surnamed Al-Sakafi, Governor of Al-Yaman and Irak.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#297</i>] Tenth Ommiade (regn. A H. 105-125 = 724-743).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#298</i>] Or ""clothe thee in worn-out clothes"" i.e. ""Become a Fakir"" or religious mendicant.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#299</i>] This gratuitous incest in ignorance injures the tale and is as repugnant to Moslem as to Christian taste.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#300</i>] The child is named either on the day of its birth or on that day week. The father whispers it in the right ear, often adding the Azán or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the ""Ikámah"" or Friday sentence. There are many rules for choosing names according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the ""Sortes Coranicæ,"" etc.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#301</i>] Amongst Moslems as amongst Christians there are seven deadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women with unchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in Holy War and disobedience to parents. The difference between the two creeds is noteworthy. And the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignorance and egoism.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#302</i>] Meaning, ""It was decreed by Destiny; so it came to pass,"" appropriate if not neat.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#303</i>] The short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camel from ""Bukhtar"" (Bactria), the ""Eastern"" (Bakhtar) region on the Amu or Jayhun (Oxus) River; afterwards called Khorasan. The two-humped camel is never seen in Arabia except with northern caravans, and to speak of it would be a sore test of Badawi credulity.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#304</i>] ""Kaylúlah"" is the ""forty-winks"" about noon: it is a Sunnat or Practice of the Prophet who said, ""Make the mid-day siesta, for verily at this hour the devils sleep not."" ""Aylúlain"" is slumbering after morning prayers (our ""beauty-sleep""), causing heaviness andid leness: ""Ghaylúlah"" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty and wretchedness: ""Kaylúlah"" (with the guttural Kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers and ""Faylúlah"" is slumbering after sunset—both held to be highly detrimental. (Pilgrimage ii 49.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#305</i>] The Biblical ""Hamath"" (Hightown) too well known to require description. It is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned by al-Hariri (assembly of the Banu Harám).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#306</i>] When they say, ""The levee flashes bright on the hills of<br>
Al-Yaman,"" the allusion is to the south quarter, where<br>
summer-lightning is seen. Al-Yaman (always with the article) means,<br>
I have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun and<br>
Al-Sham (Syria) the left-hand region.<br>
[<i>FN#307</i>] Again ""he"" for ""she,"" in delicacy and jealousy of making public the beauty or conditions of the ""veiled sex."" Even public singers would hesitate to use a feminine pronoun. As will be seen however, the rule is not invariably kept and hardly ever in Badawi poetry.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#308</i>] The normal pun on ""Nuzhat al-Zaman"" = Delight of the Age or Time.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#309</i>] The reader will find in my Pilgrimage (i. 305) a sketch of the Takht-rawan or travelling-litter, in which pilgrimesses are wont to sleep.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#310</i>] In poetry it holds the place of our Zephyr; end the ""Bád- i-Sabá""=Breeze o' the morn, Is much addressed by Persian poets.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#311</i>] Here appears the nervous, excitable, hysterical Arab temperament which is almost phrensied by the neighbourhood of a home from which he had run away.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#312</i>] Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman.<br>

<br>
[<i>FN#314</i>] Arab. ""Hubb al-Watan"" (= love of birthplace, patriotism) of which the Tradition says ""Min al-Imán"" (=is part of man's religion).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#315</i>] He is supposed to speak en prince; and he yields to a prayer when he spurns a command.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#316</i>] In such caravans each party must keep its own place under pain of getting into trouble with the watchmen and guards.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#317</i>] Mr. Payne (ii. 109) borrows this and the next quotation from the Bull Edit. i. 386.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#318</i>] For the expiation of inconsiderate oaths see Koran (chaps. v.). I cannot but think that Al-Islam treats perjury too lightly: all we can say is-that it improves upon Hinduism which practically seems to leave the punishment to the gods.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#319</i>] ""Kausar,"" as has been said, represents the classical nectar, the Amrita of the Hindus.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#320</i>] From Bull Edit. i. 186. The couplet in the Mac. Edit. i. 457 is very wildly applied.<br>

<br>
[<i>FN#322</i>] This should have assured him that he stood in no danger.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#323</i>] Here ends the wearisome tale of the brother and sister, and the romance of chivalry begins once more with the usual Arab digressions.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#324</i>] I have derived this word from the Persian ""rang""=colour, hue, kind.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#325</i>] Otherwise all would be superseded, like U. S. officials under a new President.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#326</i>] Arab. ""Nímshah"" from the Pers. Nímchah, a ""half-sword,"" a long dagger worn in the belt. Richardson derives it from Namsh, being freckled (damasked).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#327</i>] The Indian term for a tent large enough to cover a troop of cavalry.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#328</i>] Arab. ""Marhúm"" a formula before noticed. It is borrowed from the Jewish, ""of blessed memory"" (after the name of the honoured dead, Prov. x. 17.); with the addition of ""upon whom be peace,"" as opposed to the imprecation, ""May the name of the wicked rot!""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#329</i>] The speeches of the five damsels should be read only by students.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#330</i>] i.e. Those who look for ""another and a better.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#331</i>] The title of Caliph Abu Bakr because he bore truthful witness to the Apostle's mission or, others say, he confirmed the ""Mi'ráj"" or nocturnal journey to Heaven.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#332</i>] All this is Koranic (chaps. ii., etc.).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#333</i>] This may have applied more than once to ""hanging judges"" in the Far West.<br>
<br>

<br>
[<i>FN#335</i>] The Alexander of the Koran and Eastern legends, not to be confounded with the Alexander of Macedon. He will be noticed in a future Night.<br>

<br>
[<i>FN#340</i>] A noted traditionist at Cufa in the seventh century.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#341</i>] Koran, chaps. lxxiv. I (and verse 8 follows). The Archangel Gabriel is supposed to address Mohammed and not a few divines believe this Surah (chapter) to have been first revealed. Mr. Rodwell makes it No. ii. following the Fatrah or silent interval which succeeded No. xcvi. ""Clots of Blood."" See his 2nd Edit. p. 3 for further details.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#342</i>] i.e. dangerous to soul-health.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#343</i>] In the Mac. Edit. ""Abd"" for ""Sa'id."" The latter was a black and a native of Cufa during the first century (A.H ) and is still famous as a traditionist.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#344</i>] Arab. ""Shirk,"" giving a partner to Allah, attending chiefly to Christians and idolaters and in a minor degree to Jews and Guebres. We usually English it by ""polytheism,"" which is clumsy and conveys a wrong idea<br>
<br>

(High-priests) of the Shi'ah school.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#346</i>] An eminent traditionist of the eighth century (A.D.).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#347</i>] The prayers of the Fast-month and Pilgrimage-month are often said in especial places outside the towns and cities; these are the Indian Id(Eed-)gáh. They have a screen of wall about a hundred yards long with a central prayer-niche and the normal three steps for the preacher; and each extremity is garnished with an imitation minaret. They are also called Namáz-gah and one is sketched by Herklots (Plate iii. fig. 2). The object of the trips thither in Zu'l-Ka'adah and Zu'l-Hijjah is to remind Moslems of the ""Ta'aríf,"" or going forth from Meccah to Mount Arafat.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#348</i>] Arab. ""Al-Háfi,"" which in Egyptian means sore-footed as well. He was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (A.D.). He relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint Khálid bin Walíd who lies buried like the poet Ka'ab al-Ahbár near Hums (Emessa) once the Botia, Phrygia, Abdera, Suabia of Syria now Halbun (pronounced Halbáun) near Damascus. I cannot explain how this Kuraysh noble (a glorious figure in Moslem history) is claimed by the Afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak Pukhtu or Pushtu, their rough old dialect of Persian. The curious reader will consult my Pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between Mohammed and Khalid. Again there is general belief in Arabia that the English sent a mission to the Prophet, praying that Khalid might be despatched to proselytise them: unfortunately Mohammed was dead and the ""Ingríz"" ratted. It is popularly held that no armed man can approach Khalid's grave; but I suppose my revolver did not count.<br>

<br>
[<i>FN#354</i>] Founder of the Hanbali, fourth (in date) of the four orthodox Moslem schools. The Caliph al-Mu'atasim bi'llah, son of Harun al-Rashid, who believed the Koran to have been created and not a Logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with Allah, scourged this Imam severely for ""differing in opinion"" (A.H. 220=833). In fact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without a caress of the scourge or the sword.<br>

""Músá"": the Egyptian word was ""Mesu,"" the ""child"" or the ""boy"" (brought up in the palace?), and the Hebrews made it ""Mosheh"" or ""one drawn out of the water;"" ""Mu"" in Egypt being water, the Arab ""Ma""; whence probably the moderns have derived the dim.

[<i>FN#362</i>] Arab. ""Taub"" (Saub), the long shirt popularly written in English Tobe and pronounced so by Egyptians. It is worn by both sexes (Lane, M. E. chaps. i. ""Tob"") in Egypt, and extends into the heart of Moslem Africa: I can compare it with nothing but a long nightgown dyed a dirty yellow by safflower and about as picturesque as a carter's smock-frock.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#363</i>] There is nothing of this in the Koran; and it is a most unhappy addition, as Moses utterly and pretentiously ignored a ""next world.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#364</i>] Koran xxviii. 22-27. Mohammed evidently confounded the contract between Laban and Jacob. (Gen. xxix. 15-39.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#365</i>] So says Al-Hariri (Ass. of Sasan), ""The neighbour before the house and the traveller before the journey."" In certain cities the neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every action and abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand and with the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities. This loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowed from Christianity.<br>

[<i>FN#369</i>] An Egyptian doctor of the law (ninth century).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#370</i>] Koran lxxvii. 35, 36. This is one of the earliest and most poetical chapters of the book.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#371</i>] Abu Hanifah was scourged for refusing to take office and was put to death in prison, it is said by poison (A.H. 150=A.D. 767), for a judicial sentence authorising rebellion against the second Abbaside, Al-Mansur, surnamed Abu'l-Dawánik (Father of Pence) for his exceeding avarice.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#372</i>] ""Lá rayba fí-hi"" says the Koran (ii. 1) of itself; and the saying is popularly applied to all things of the Faith.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#373</i>] Arab. ""Rivál al-Ghayb,"" somewhat like the ""Himalayan Brothers"" of modern superstition. See Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam) for a long and careful description of these ""Mardán-i-Ghayb"" (Pers.), a ""class of people mounted on clouds,"" invisible, but moving in a circular orbit round the world, and suggesting the Hindu ""Lokapálas."" They should not be in front of the traveller nor on his right, but either behind or on his left hand. Hence tables, memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain the station, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#374</i>] A sweetmeat before noticed.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#375</i>] Door hinges in the east are two projections for the top and bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel and threshold. It appears to be the primitive form, for we find it in the very heart of Africa. In the basaltic cities of the Hauran, where the doors are of thick stone, they move easily on these pins. I found them also in the official (not the temple)City of Palmyra, but all broken.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#376</i>] The effect of the poison and of the incantation which accompanied it.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#377</i>] King Omar who had raped her. My sympathies are all with the old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#378</i>] Arab. ""Zunnár,"" the Gr. . Christians and Jews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the Caliph Al- Mutawakkil (AD. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public, hence it became a badge of the Faith. Probably it was confounded with the ""Janeo"" (Brahmanical thread) and the Parsi sacred girdle called Kashti. (Dabistan i, 297, etc.). Both Mandeville and La Brocquière speak of ""Christians of the Girdle, because they are all girt above,"" intending Jacobites or Nestorians.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#379</i>] ""Siláh dár"" (Arab. and Pers.)=a military officer of high rank; literally an ""armour-bearer,"" chosen for velour and trustworthiness. So Jonathan had a ""young man"" (brave) who bare his armour (I Sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and Goliath had a man that bare the shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). Men will not readily forget the name of Sulayman Agha, called the Silahdar, in Egypt. (Lane M. E. chaps. iv.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#380</i>] It will be told afterwards.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#381</i>] The elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and proved himself a good Moslem by not having recourse to civil war.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#382</i>] Arab. ""Ghazwah,"" the corrupt Gallicism, now<br>
Europeanised=raid, foray.<br>
[<i>FN#383</i>] Turk in modern parlance means a Turkoman, a pomade: the settled people call themselves Osmanli or Othmanli. Turkoman=Turk- like.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#384</i>] Arab. ""Nimsá;"" southern Germans, Austrians; from the Slav. ""Nemica"" (any Germans), literally meaning ""The dumb"" (nemac), because they cannot speak Slav.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#385</i>] Arab. ""Dubárá"" from the Slav. ""Dubrovnik,"" from ""Dub"" (an oak) and ""Dubrava"" (an oak forest). Ragusa, once a rival of Venice, gave rise to the word ""Argosy."" D'Herbelot calls it ""Dobravenedik"" or ""Good Venice,"" the Turkish name, because it paid tribute when Venice would not (?).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#386</i>] Arab. ""Jawarnah,"" or, ""Júrnah"" evidently Zara, a place of many names, Jadera (Hirtius de Bell. Alex. cap. 13), Jadra, Zadra (whence the modern term), Diadora, Diadosca and Jadrossa. This important Liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusading days; hence the Arabs came to know its name.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#387</i>] Arab. ""Banu'l-Asfar;"" which may mean ""Pale faces,"" in the sense of ""yeller girls"" (New Orleans) and that intended by North American Indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rather tow-coloured) hair we now call Russians. The races of Hindostan term the English not ""white men,"" but ""red men;"" and the reason will at once be seen by comparing a Britisher with a high-caste Nágar Brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunk exsangue cuminum. The Yellow-faces of the text correspond with the Sansk. ""Svetadvipa""—Whiteman's Land.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#388</i>] Arab. ""Al-Musakhkham."" No Moslem believes that Isa was crucified and a favourite fancy is that Judas, changed to the likeness of Jesus, thus paid for his treason. (Evangel. Barnabæ.) Hence the resurrection is called not ""Kiyámah"" but ""Kumámah""=rubbish. This heresy about the Cross they share with the Docetes, ""certain beasts in the shape of men"" (says Ignatius), who held that a phantom was crucified. So far the Moslems are logical, for ""Isa,"" being angelically, miraculously and immaculately conceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when they hold a vacant place near Mohammed's tomb for the body of Isa after his second coming as a forerunner to Mohammed and Doomday. (Pilgrimage ii. 89.)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#389</i>] A diviner, priest, esp. Jewish, and not belonging to the tribe of Levi.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#390</i>] Again the coarsest word ""Khara."" The allusion is to the<br>
vulgar saying, ""Thou eatest skite!"" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense).<br>
Decent English writers modify this to, ""Thou eatest dirt:"" and Lord<br>
Beaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into ""eating sand.""<br>
[<i>FN#391</i>] These silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, excite<br>
Easterns to fury. I have seen a Moslem wild with rage on hearing a<br>
Christian parody the opening words of the Koran, ""Bismillahi 'l-<br>
Rahmáni 'l-Rahím, Mismish wa Kamar al-din,"" roughly translated,<br>
<br>
""In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate! Apricots and marmalede."" The idea of the Holy Merde might have been suggested by the Hindus: see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the King, who therewith anoints his brow and breast, &amp;c. And, incredible to relate, this is still practiced after a fashion by the Parsis, one of the most progressive and the sharpest witted of Asiatic races.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#392</i>] Meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (of ashes?) as certain do on Ash Wednesday.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#393</i>] Syria, the ""left-hand land"" as has before been explained. The popular saying about its people is ""Shámi shúmi!""—the Syrian is small potatoes (to render the sense Americanicè). Nor did Syrus, the slave in Roman days, bear the best of names. In Al-Hijaz the Syrian is addressed ""Abú Shám"" (Father of Syria) and insulted as ""Abuser of the Salt"" (a traitor). Yet many sayings of Mohammed are recorded in honour of Syria, and he sometimes used Syriac words. Such were ""Bakh, bakh"" (=euge, before noticed), and ""Kakh,"" a congener of the Latin Cacus and Caca which our day has docked to ""cack."" (Pilgrimage iii. 115)<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#394</i>] Koran xiv. 34. ""They (Unbelievers) shall be thrown therein (i.e., the House of Perdition=Hell); and an unhappy dwelling shall it be.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#395</i>] The leg-cut is a prime favourite with the Eastern Sworder, and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#396</i>] Mohammed repeatedly declared (Koran lxi.) that the Christians had falsified the passage (""I go to my Father and the Paraclete shall come,"" John xvi. 7) promising the advent of the Comforter, (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substituting the latter word for glorious, renowned, i.e., Ahmed or Mohammed=the praised one. This may have been found in the Arabic translation of the Gospels made by Warakah, cousin to Mohammed's first wife; and hence in Koran lxi. we find Jesus prophesying of an Apostle ""whose name shall be Ahmad."" The word has consequently been inserted into the Arabic Gospel of Saint Barnabas (Dabistan iii. 67). Moslems accept the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the Gospel; but assert (Koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelessly corrupted, and they are right. Moses, to whom the Pentateuch is attributed, notices his own death and burial—""the mair the miracle,"" said the old Scotch lady. The ""Psalms of David"" range over a period of some five hundred years, and there are three Isaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. The many apocryphal Gospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical at different times and in different places, prove that the four, which are still in use, were retained because they lack the manifest absurdities of their discarded rivals.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#397</i>] Arab. "" Labbayka; "" the Pilgrimage-cry (Night xxii.) which in Arabic is,<br>
<br>
Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!<br>
Lá Sharíka lake, Labbayk'!<br>
Inna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk!<br>
Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!<br>
<br>
Some add ""Here am I, and I honour Thee, the son of Thy two slaves; beneficence and good are all between Thy hands.""With the ""Talbiyah"" the pilgrims should bless the Prophet, pray Allah to grant Heaven and exclaim, ""By Thy mercy spare us from the pains of Hell-fire!"" (Pilgrimage iii. 232.) Labbayka occurs in the verses attributed to Caliph Ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one house faces another); lastly, he professed submission to Allah; in which sense, together with the verbal noun ""Talbiyah,"" it is used by Al- Hanri (Pref. and Ass. of Su'adah).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#398</i>] Arab. ""Kissís"" (plur. Kusús) from .<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#399</i>] Koran ii. The ""red cow"" is evidently the ""red heifer"" of<br>
Barnabas, chaps. vii.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#400</i>] Arab. ""Al-Jásalík""= .<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#401</i>] This is from the first ""Gospel of Infancy,"" wherein Jesus said to his mother, ""Verily I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Word which thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel did declare unto thee; and my Father hath sent me to save the world"" (chaps. i. 2.). The passage is virtually quoted in the Koran (chaps. iii. 141), of course omitting "" the Son of God""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#402</i>] Mohammed allowed his locks to grow down to his ear-lobes but never lower.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#403</i>] Arab. ""Lisám"" I have explained as a covering for the lower face, made by drawing over it the corner of the head-kerchief (Pilgrimage i. 346). The Lisám of the African Tawárik hoods the eyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes all the lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. And this is worn by many men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evil eye. The native Sultans of Darfur, like those of Bornu and others further west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, the ceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. The Kúfiyah or head-kerchief of the Arabs soon reached Europe and became in Low Latin Cuphia; in Spanish Escofia; in Ital. Cuffia or Scuffia; in French Escoffion, Scofion (Reine Marguerite) Coëffe (une pellicule, marque de bonheur) Coiffe and Coife, &amp;c.; the Scotch Curch or Coif, opposed to the maiden snood, and, lastly our Sergeant-at-Law's Coif. Littré, the Learned, who in erudition was né coiffé, has missed this obvious derivation.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#404</i>] ""Cutting,"" throughout the book, alludes to the scymitar with which Arabs never give point; and ""thrusting"" to the footman's spear and the horseman's lance.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#405</i>] A popular phrase, I repeat, for extreme tenor and consternation.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#406</i>] The name usually applies to a well-known district and city of Al Yaman, where ""Koss the eloquent"" was bishop in Mohammed's day: the Negiran of D'Herbelot. Here, however, it is the Syrian Najrán (Nejrân of Missionary Porter's miserable Handbook), now a wretched village near the volcanic Lajjá, about one hundred and twenty miles direct south of Damascus and held by Druzes and Christians.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#407</i>] The Kantár (quintal) of 100 ratls (Ibs.) =98-99 Ibs. avoir.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#408</i>] Arab. ""Juráb (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly),"" the ""curdling of the testicles"" in fear is often mentioned.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#409</i>] Clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied by mediæval Jews.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#410</i>] Arab. ""Sahákah,"" lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a great school for this ""Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love ""; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as ""bazar"" hence Tabzír=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates "" Bazarah"" by slut or wench. He adds "" it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes also entice Zambúr and which are cut off in girlhood."" See also Lane, Lex. s.v.; Tabzír. Both writers confuse excision of the nymphæ with circumcision of the clitoris (Zambúr) Al-Siyúti (Kitab al-Izá' fi'Ilm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery, which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as ""Gamiani,"" and ""Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef,"" Lesbos, 1718. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems and girls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from Europe.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#411</i>] This is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the East. Hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile ""two reds,"" i.e. meat and wine; while the ""two reds,"" which corrupt women, are gold and saffron, that is perfumery. Hence also the saying of Mohammed:— ""Perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for women should have colour and not scent."" (Mishkát al-Masábíh ii. 361.)<br>
<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#412</i>] These are the ""Hibás"" or thin cords of wool which the<br>
Badawi binds round his legs, I believe to keep off cramp.<br>
(Pilgrimage iii. 78).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#413</i>] Crying out ""La iláha illa 'llah."" (There is no god but the<br>
God.); technically called ""Tahlíl.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#414</i>] i.e. Men, angels and devils, the ""Triloka"" (triple people) of the Hindus. Alamín (plur.), never Alamayn (dual), is the Triregno denoted by the papal Tiara, the three Christian kingdoms being Heaven, Hell and Purgatory.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#415</i>] Matrahinna or Mit-Rahinah is a well-known village near Memphis, the name being derived from the old Egyptian Minat-ro- hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal. Let me remark that two of these three words, ""Minat"" and ""Ru,"" are still common in "" Aryan"" Persian.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#416</i>] Kirámat, a sign, a prodigy, opposed to Mu'ujizah, a miracle wrought by a prophet. The Sufis explain this thaumaturgy by Allah changing something of Nature's ordinary course in favour of an especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is Catholic doctrine (See Dabistan, iii. 173).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#417</i>] Koran, x. 25, ""until the earth receive its vesture and be adorned with various plants.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#418</i>] i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#419</i>] A fighter for the faith and now a title which follows the name, e.g. Osmán Páshá Ghází, whom the English press dubbed ""Ghazi Osman.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#420</i>] That is the King of Constantinople.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#421</i>] Cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: "" Shambar"" is the<br>
Arab. form of the Persian "" Chambar.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#422</i>] Koran, ii. 149. Hence the vulgar idea that Martyrs are still alive in the flesh. See my Pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere) for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. The Commentators (Jalál al-Dín, etc.) play tricks with the Koranic words, "" they (martyrs) are not dead but living"" (iii. 179) by placing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the waters of Paradise; whereas the reprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds which drain the sanies and the boiling waters of Hell. Amongst the Greeks a body remaining entire long after death suggests Anathema Maranatha: it is the contrary with Catholic Christians (Boccaccio iv. 5, of the Pot of Basil). Concerning this creed see Maundrell, Letter of 1698.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#423</i>] Tor is ""Mount Sinai"" in the Koran (xcv. 1). I have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: ""It is evident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Coptic Christianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after the visions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the Convent by Justinian belongs to A.D 527. Ras Safsáfah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south is the property of Rüppell"" (Midian Revisited i., 237). I would therefore call the ""Sinaitic"" Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days and Peninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still my conviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Aráif, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj- road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koran writes ""Sainá"" and ""Sínín"") there is a dispute: It is usually derived from the root ""Sanah""=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, would connect it with ""Sin,"" the Assyrian Moon- god as Mount Nebo with the Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunar temple as a Solar fane stands on Ba'al Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or the classical Mount Casius.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#424</i>] Alluding to the miracle of Aaron's rod (the gift of Jethro) as related in the Koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), where the Egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magic twisted and coiled like serpents.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#425</i>] Arab. ""Ayát"" lit. ""signs,"" here ""miracles of the truth,"" 1. c. Koranic versets as opposed to chapters. The ranks of the enemy represent the latter, sword-cuts the former—a very persuasive mode of preaching.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#426</i>] Lane (M. E. chapt.. iii.) shows by a sketch the position of the worshipper during this ""Salám"" which is addressed, some say, to the guardian angels, others suppose to all brother-believers and angels.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#427</i>] i.e., where the Syrians found him.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#428</i>] i.e., Dedianus Arabised; a name knightly and plebian.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#429</i>] In such tales the Wazir is usually the sharp-witted man, contrasting with the ""dummy,"" or master.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#430</i>] Carrier-pigeons were extensively used at this time. The Caliph Al-Násir li-Díni lláh (regn. A.H. 575=1180) was, according to Ibn Khaldún, very fond of them. The moderns of Damascus still affect them. My successor, Mr. Consul Kirby Green, wrote an excellent report on pigeon-fancying at Damascus. The so-called Maundeville or Mandeville in A. D. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeons in Syria as a well-known mode Of intercourse between lord and lord.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#431</i>] Mohammed who declared ""There is no monkery in Al-Islam,"" and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion to the shaveling (Ruhbán). But the ""Gens æterna in quâ nemo nascitur"" (Pliny v. 17) managed to appear even in Al-lslam, as Fakirs,, Dervishes, Súfis, etc. Of this more hereafter.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#432</i>] i.e. her holiness would act like a fascinating talisman.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#433</i>] The ""smoking out"" practice is common amongst the Arabs: hence Marshal Pelissier's so- called "" barbarity."" The Public is apt to forget that on a campaign the general's first duty is to save his own men by any practice which the laws of fair warfare do not absolutely forbid.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#434</i>] i.e. Mohammed, who promised Heaven and threatened Hell.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#435</i>] Arab. ""Ahr"" or ""ihr,"" fornication or adultery, i.e., irreligion, infidelity as amongst the Hebrews (Isaiah xxiii.17).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#436</i>] A sign of defeat.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#437</i>] In English ""last night"": I have already noted that the Moslem day, like the Jewish and the Scandinavian, begins at sundown; and ""layl "" a night, is often used to denote the twenty- four hours between sunset and sunset, whilst ""yaum,"" a day, would by us be translated in many cases ""battle-day.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#438</i>] Iterum the ""Himalayan Brothers.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#439</i>] Again, Mohammed who promised Good to the Good, and vice versâ.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#440</i>] They are sad doggrel like most of the pièces d'occasion inserted in The Nights.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#441</i>] Here ""Kahwah"" (coffee) is used in its original sense of strong old wine. The derivation is ""Akhá""=fastidire fecit, causing disinclination for food, the Matambre (kill- hunger) of the Iberians. In old days the scrupulous called coffee ""Kihwah"" in order to distinguish it from 'Kakwah,"" wine.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#442</i>] i.e. Mohammed, a common title.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#443</i>] That is, fatal to the scoffer and the impious.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#444</i>] Equivalent to our ""The Devil was sick,"" etc.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#445</i>] i.e. to the enemy: the North American Indians (so called) use similar forms of ""inverted speech""; and the Australian aborigines are in no way behind them.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#446</i>] See Vol. i., p. 154 (Night xvi.).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#447</i>] Arab. ""Sauf,"" a particle denoting a near future whereas<br>
""Sa-"" points to one which may be very remote.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#448</i>] From the root ""Shanh""=having a fascinating eye, terrifying. The Irish call the fascinater ""eybitter"" and the victim (who is also rhymed to death) ""eybitten.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#449</i>] i.e., not like the noble-born, strong in enduring the stress of fight.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#450</i>] i.e., of Abraham. For the Well Zemzem and the Place of Abraham see my Pilgrimage (iii. 171-175, etc.), where I described the water as of salt-bitter taste, like that of Epsom (iii. 203). Sir William Muir (in his excellent life of Mahomet, I. cclviii.) remarks that ""the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;"" but soldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be had in Calcutta and elsewhere after Pilgrimage time; and analysis would at once detect the salt.<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#451</i>] Racing was and is a favourite pastime with those hippomanists, the Arabs; but it contrasts strongly with our civilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed. The Prophet is said to have limited betting in these words, ""There shall be no wagering save on the Kuff (camel's foot), the Hafir (hoof of horse, ass, etc.) or the Nasal (arrow-pile or lance head).""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#452</i>] In the Mac. Edit. ""Arman""=Armenia, which has before occurred. The author or scribe here understands by ""Cæsarea"" not the old Turris Stratonis, Herod's city called after Augustus, but Cæsareia the capital of Cappadocia (Pliny, vi. 3), the royal residence before called Mazaca (Strabo).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#453</i>] An idiom meaning ""a very fool.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#454</i>] i.e. Kána (was) má (that which) was (kána).<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#455</i>] A son being ""the lamp of a dark house.""<br>
<br>
[<i>FN#456</i>] When the Israelites refused to receive the Law (the souls of all the Prophets even those unborn being present at the Covenant), Allah tore up the mountain (Sinai which is not mentioned) by the roots and shook it over their heads to terrify them, saying, ""Receive the Law which we have given you with a resolution to keep it"" (Koran chaps. xlx. 170). Much of this story is from the Talmud (Abodah Sar. 2, 2, Tract Sabbath, etc.) whence Al-Islam borrowed so much of its Judaism, as it took Christianity from the Apocryphal New Testament. This tradition is still held by the Israelites, says Mr. Rodwell (p. 333) who refers it to a misunderstanding of Exod. xix. 17, rightly rendered in the E. version ""at the nether part of the mountain.""<br>

"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
Oh, the weather outside is frightful<br>
But the fire is so delightful<br>
And since we've no place to go<br>
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping<br>
And I've brought me some corn for popping<br>
The lights are turned way down low<br>
Let it snow, let it snow<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
When we finally kiss goodnight<br>
How I'll hate going out in the storm<br>
But if you really hold me tight<br>
All the way home I'll be warm<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
And the fire is slowly dying<br>
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing<br>
But as long as you love me so<br>
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
When we finally kiss goodnight<br>
How I'll hate going out in the storm<br>
But if you really grab me tight<br>
All the way home I'll be warm<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>

"<p>[Перевод песни: Travis Scott — «MELTDOWN» ft. Drake]<br>
<br>
[Часть I]<br>
<br>
[Интро: Drake]<br>
Е<br>
Напряжение точно растет<br>
Слишком пьян прямо сейчас<br>
Время T, время T<br>
Время T, время T, время T<br>
<br>
[Куплет 1: Drake]<br>
Чаепитие, как будто у меня есть чашка этого дерьма<br>
Время игры в гольф в без четверти шесть<br>
Я бы с удовольствием трахнул обычную суку<br>
Известные шлюхи скучные, но они остаются на моём члене<br>
Услышал твою новую хуйню, это смущает, дерьмо<br>
Ты говоришь с копами о каком-то ебаном терапевте<br>
Ты ведешь себя так, как будто обожаешь это американское дерьмо<br>
Но, на самом деле, правда в том, что ты боишься шестёрки<br>
Да, ты боишься шестёрки<br>
Да, ты боишься шестёрки<br>
Твой телохранитель отработал на удачу<br>
Теперь ты хочешь стать наследником этого дерьма<br>
Не говори со мной о сравнении, дерьмо<br>
Или поговори с парнем с каким-нибудь высокомерным дерьмом<br>
У нас в руках оружие террористов<br>
Как телевизионные продюсеры  мы, гр, мы показываем это дерьмо<br>
Она просит деньги у своих родителей и прочее дерьмо<br>
Я сказал ей: «У меня нет наличных», а она сказала, что будет ждать стопку рэксов, на каком-нибудь арабском дерьме<br>
Я достаю миллион и смотрю на это дерьмо<br>
Мой член только что затвердел, потому что только что задел провод<br>
У меня нет расписания, приходи и крутись с нами, серьёзно<br>
Чел, нахуй это повествовательное дерьмо<br>
Я уничтожаю цепи, которые купил у твоего босса<br>
Мне похуй на всю эту культурную ценность<br>
С тех пор как V нет рядом, они повесили Луи, они даже не носят это дерьмо<br>
Не приходи к парню по поводу ремонта всякого дерьма<br>
Не приходи к парню, чтобы сохранить дерьмо<br>
Ты везучий, что Vogue подал в суд, потому что я был бы с Wassas в Париже и прочим дерьмом<br>
<br>
[Часть II]<br>
<br>
[Переход]<br>
(<i>I-I—</i>)<br>
<br>
[Куплет 2: Travis Scott]<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл? Ты, блять, с ума сошёл? (А)<br>
И они боятся семёрки (Семь)<br>
После одного-трех мы получили одиннадцать (Е)<br>
Держим это дерьмо открытым, как 7-Eleven (Это ахуенно)<br>
Я дома, у меня в раю семеро<br>
Они думают, что я сатанист, но я остаюсь священным<br>
Малышка-психотерапевт, выкладывает своё дерьмо<br>
Она приближается ко мне и начинает признаваться<br>
Я знаю, что на кону, я кричу: «Освободите Джеффри»<br>
Подключайтесь и принимайте звонки прямо с телефона<br>
Сделал её грустной, не говоря уже о животе<br>
Не будь искренним, я иду по стопам Makaveli<br>
У меня есть сок, теперь он густой (Сок)<br>
Всегда на t-time, всегда готов (T, а), да<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошел? Ты, блять, с ума со— (Да, под кайфом, поехали)<br>
Пакую стопки, пакую, потому что у меня есть собственность (Пакую, стопки, пакую)<br>
Шоколадный AP и шоколадные алмазы (Алмазы), у меня есть фабрика Вилли Вонка (Алмазы)<br>
Сжигаю спортсмена, как калории, найди другое пламя, горячее, чем я, сука<br>
<br>
[Часть III]<br>
<br>
[Переход: Travis Scott]<br>
(О-о)<br>
<br>
[Припев: Drake &amp; <i>Travis Scott</i>]<br>
Е, ты, блять, с ума сошёл? (На)<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл? (Что?)<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл? (На, на)<br>
<i>Ты, блять, с ума сошел? А<br>

Ты, блять, с ума сошёл?</i><br>
<br>
[Куплет 3: Travis Scott]<br>
Сколько техасских парней сделали это? Пара, может быть (Пара, может быть)<br>
Раскачиваюсь в пикапе, детка, нахуй Мерседес (Нахуй Мерседес)<br>
Я трахну сучку-ниггера, но она не сможет родить ребенка (Родить ребенка)<br>
Я пристрелю твою задницу в Walmart, как будто я DaBaby (В Walmart)<br>
Парень косит под Лионеля Месси, я — Том Брэди (У-у)<br>
Раньше, в былые времена, я носил цепи приспущенными (У-у)<br>
Теперь я позволяю цепям висеть, может быть, тебе стоит спрятать свои (Спрячь их, спрячь их)<br>
Ниггеры говорят «<i>Scarface</i>», я такой в реальной жизни (О-о)<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл, или как? Ты, блять, с ума сошёл? (Ёбаный псих)<br>
Чувак, клуб изменился с тех пор, как мы потеряли Мерседес (Прямо сейчас)<br>
Чувак, клика изменилась с тех пор, как они потеряли величайшего (На, на, на)<br>
Мы снаружи с армией, так что тебе нужен... у, у<br>
Эти парни становятся коричневыми, как будто взбивают соус<br>
Устроим цирк снаружи, как будто это Бейли Барнума (Это ахуенно)<br>
Блики, висящие на мне, как будто они действительно стучат (Блики, блики, блики)<br>
Она сдвигает свои трусики в сторону, она хочет, чтобы они были сырыми, когда выцветут (А? А? А? А?)<br>
<br>
[Припев: Travis Scott]<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл? А<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл? А<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл, или что?<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл? Е<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл, или что?<br>
Ты, блять, с ума со—<br>
Ты, блять, с ума со—<br>
Ты, блять, с ума сошёл?</p>

",non-music,E
"<p>As his cab turned by the end of the Pont Royal towards the Gare d'Orsay, M. Etienne Rambert looked at his watch and found, as he had anticipated, that he had a good quarter of an hour before the train that he intended to take was due to start. He called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage.<br>
<br>
""Where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?"" he enquired.<br>
<br>
The porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the Gare d'Orsay, and M. Etienne Rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for Verrières, the station at which he had to alight for the château of Beaulieu.<br>
<br>
Still attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, M. Etienne Rambert proceeded to the booking-office and took a first-class ticket. He spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter.<br>
<br>
""The Luchon train,"" he said; ""where is it?"" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: ""Lead the way, and I will follow.""<br>
<br>
It was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains. M. Etienne Rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage.<br>
<br>
""You want the express, sir?""<br>
<br>
""No, the slow train, my man.""<br>
<br>
The porter showed some surprise, but made no remark.<br>
<br>
""Do you like the front or the back of the train?""<br>
<br>
""The back by choice.""<br>
<br>
""First-class, isn't it?""<br>
<br>
""Yes, first-class.""<br>
<br>
The porter, who had stopped a moment, picked up the heavy valise again.<br>
<br>
""Then there isn't any choice. There are only two first-class carriages on the slow train, and they are both in the middle.""<br>
<br>
""They are corridor carriages, I suppose?"" said Etienne Rambert.<br>
<br>
""Yes, sir; there are hardly any others on the main-line trains, especially first-class.""<br>
<br>
In the ever-increasing crowd Etienne Rambert had some difficulty in following the porter. The Gare d'Orsay has little or none of the attractiveness of the other stations, which cannot fail to have a certain fascination for any imaginative person, who thinks of the mystery attaching to all those iron rails reaching out into the distance of countries unknown to him. It is less noisy than the others also, for between Austerlitz and Orsay the traction is entirely electric. And further, there is no clearly defined separation between the main and the suburban lines.<br>
<br>
On the right of the platform was the train which was to take Etienne Rambert beyond Brives to Verrières, the slow train to Luchon; and on the left of the same platform was another train for Juvisy and all the small stations in the suburbs of Paris.<br>
<br>
Very few people were making for the train to Luchon; but a large crowd was pressing into the suburban train.<br>
<br>
The porter who was piloting M. Etienne Rambert, set the baggage he was carrying down on the footboard of a first-class carriage.<br>
<br>
""There is no one for the slow train yet, sir; if you like to get in first you can choose your own compartment.""<br>
<br>
M. Etienne Rambert acted on the suggestion, but he had hardly set foot in the corridor before the guard, also scenting a generous tip, came to offer his services.<br>
<br>
""It really is the 8.50 you want, sir?"" was his first enquiry. ""You are sure you are not making a mistake?""<br>
<br>
""No,"" Etienne Rambert replied. ""Why?""<br>
<br>
""A great many first-class passengers do make a mistake,"" the man explained, ""and confuse the 8.50 with the 8.45 express.""<br>
<br>
As he spoke the guard took the baggage from the porter who had remained on the platform, and the porter, after being generously remunerated for his trouble by M. Rambert, hurried away to look for other travellers.<br>
<br>
""The 8.45 is the express, isn't it?"" M. Rambert enquired.<br>
<br>
""Yes,"" the guard answered; ""it runs right through without stopping at all the small stations as this train does. It goes in front of this one and gets to Luchon three hours earlier. There it is on the side there,"" and he pointed through the window in the door on the far side to another train on the next rails, in which a number of travellers were already taking their seats. ""If you prefer to go by that one, sir,"" he went on, ""there is still time for you to change; you are entitled to take your choice since you have a first-class ticket.""<br>
<br>
But Etienne Rambert, after a moment's consideration, declined the suggestion.<br>
<br>
""No: I would rather go by the slow train. If I take the express I should have to get out at Brives, and then I should be twelve or thirteen miles from Saint-Jaury, which is my destination; whereas the slow train stops at Verrières, where, by the way, I have already telegraphed to say I shall arrive to-morrow morning.""<br>
<br>
He walked a little way along the corridor, assuring himself that the various compartments were still quite empty, and then turned to the guard.<br>
<br>
""Look here, my man,"" he said, ""I am awfully tired, and I mean to get some sleep to-night; consequently I should like to be alone. Now where shall I be most quiet and undisturbed?""<br>
<br>
The man understood. M. Etienne Rambert's enquiry about the place where he would be most quiet, was an implicit promise of a handsome tip if nobody did disturb him.<br>
<br>
""If you like to settle yourself here, sir,"" the man answered, ""you can draw down the blinds at once, and I dare say I shall be able to find room for any other passengers somewhere else.""<br>
<br>
""Good,"" said M. Rambert, moving towards the compartment indicated. ""I will smoke a cigar until the train starts, and immediately afterwards I will settle down to sleep. By the way, my man, since you seem so obliging, I wish you would undertake to call me to-morrow morning in time for me to get out at Verrières. I am desperately sleepy and I am quite capable of not waking up.""<br>
<br>
The guard touched his cap.<br>
<br>
""You can be perfectly easy, sir, and sleep without the least anxiety. I won't fail.""<br>
<br>
""Very well.""<br>
<br>
When his baggage had been stowed away, and his rugs spread out to make the seat more comfortable still, M. Etienne Rambert repeated his appeal, for he was an old traveller and knew that it does not do to rely too much upon the promises of chance attendants.<br>
<br>
""I can rely upon you, can't I? I may sleep as sound as I like, and you will wake me at Verrières?"" And the more to assure himself that the guard would execute his orders he slipped a franc into his hand.<br>
<br>
When he was left alone, M. Rambert continued his preparations for the night. He carefully drew down the blinds over the door and over the windows of the compartment that gave on to the corridor, and also lowered the shade over the electric light, and then, in order to enjoy the last puffs at his cigar in peace, he opened the window over the other door and leant his elbows on it, watching the final preparations being made by the travellers by the express on the other line.<br>
<br>
The departure of a train is always a picturesque sight, and M. Rambert leant forward inquisitively to note how the passengers had installed themselves in the two compartments which he could see from his coign of vantage.<br>
<br>
There were not many people in the train. As a matter of fact the Brives and Luchon line is not much used at this time of year. If the number of passengers in the express were any criterion Etienne Rambert might reasonably expect that he would be the only one in the slow train. But there was not much time for observations and reflections of this kind. On the platform for the express, which he got a glimpse of through the compartments, people were hurrying up their farewells. The passengers had got into their carriages, and the friends who had come to see them off were standing alone upon the platform. There was the sound of safety locks being fastened by porters, and the noise of trollies being wheeled along bearing articles for sale.<br>
<br>
""Pillows! Rugs! Sweets! Papers!""<br>
<br>
Then came the whistle of the guard, the shriller scream from the electric engine, and then, slowly at first but steadily, more rapidly as the engine got up speed, the express moved along the platform and plunged into the tunnel on the way to Austerlitz.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the guard of the slow train was doing wonders. Shamelessly resolved to assure perfect quiet to ""his"" passenger, he managed, without unduly compromising himself but yet without leaving any doubt about it in any mind, to insinuate discreetly that M. Rambert's carriage was reserved, so that that gentleman might count upon an entirely undisturbed night.<br>
<br>
A few minutes after the express had gone, the slow train drew out in its turn, and disappeared into the darkness of the underground tunnel.<br>
<br>
At the château of Beaulieu young Charles Rambert was just finishing dressing when a gentle tap sounded on the door of his room.<br>
<br>
""It is a quarter to five, Charles. Get up at once!""<br>
<br>
""I am awake already, Thérèse,"" Charles Rambert answered with some pride. ""I shall be ready in two minutes.""<br>
<br>
""What? up already?"" the girl exclaimed from the other side of the door. ""Marvelous! I congratulate you. I'm ready too; I will wait for you in the dining-room. Come down as soon as you are dressed.""<br>
<br>
""All right!"" the young man answered.<br>
<br>
He wasted no time over his toilette, the more so because it was none too warm in his room, for at this early hour it was still quite dark; and then taking his light in one hand he opened his door carefully so as to make no noise, tip-toed along the landing, and went down the staircase to join Thérèse in the dining-room. The girl was an accomplished housekeeper already, and while waiting for the young fellow she had got a scratch meal together.<br>
<br>
""Let us have breakfast quickly,"" she suggested; ""it isn't snowing this morning, and if you like we might walk to the station. We have plenty of time, and it will do us good to have a walk.""<br>
<br>
""It will warm us up anyhow,"" Charles Rambert replied; he was only half-awake, but he sat beside Thérèse, and did justice to the preparations she had made.<br>
<br>
""Do you know that it is very wonderful of you to get up so punctually?"" Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter remarked. ""How did you manage it? Last night you were afraid you would sleep on as usual.""<br>
<br>
""It was not much trouble for me to wake up,"" Charles Rambert answered. ""I hardly closed an eye all night.""<br>
<br>
""But I promised to come and knock at your door myself, so you might have slept without any anxiety.""<br>
<br>
""That's so, but to tell you the truth, Thérèse, I was regularly upset and excited by the thought of papa arriving this morning.""<br>
<br>
They had both finished breakfast, and Thérèse got up.<br>
<br>
""Shall we start?"" she asked.<br>
<br>
""Yes.""<br>
<br>
Thérèse opened the hall door, and the two young people went down the flight of steps leading to the garden. The girl had thrown a big cloak over her shoulders, and she inhaled the pure morning air with keen delight.<br>
<br>
""I love going out in the early morning,"" she declared.<br>
<br>
""Well, I don't like it at all,"" Charles Rambert confessed with characteristic candour. ""Good Lord, how cold it is! And it is still pitch dark!""<br>
<br>
""Surely you are not going to be frightened?"" said Thérèse teasingly.<br>
<br>
Charles Rambert made an irritable movement of vexation and surprise.<br>
<br>
""Frightened? What do you take me for, Thérèse? If I don't like going out in the early morning it's really only because it is cold.""<br>
<br>
She laughed at him while they were crossing the lawn towards the out-buildings, through which she meant to get out on to the high road. As they passed the stables they came across a groom who was leisurely getting an old brougham out of the coach-house.<br>
<br>
""Don't hurry, Jean,"" Thérèse called out as she greeted him. ""We are going to walk to the station, and the only important thing is that you should be there to bring us back.""<br>
<br>
The man touched his cap and the two young people passed through the park gate and found themselves upon the high road.<br>
<br>
It was still very dark, with just a wan reflection in the distance of the sky vaguely outlining some cloud-shapes to the eastward to give some promise of the day. There was no sound to break the silence of the fields, and as they walked briskly along Charles and Thérèse could hear their footsteps ringing on the hard surface of the frozen ground.<br>
<br>
""It must please you awfully to be going to meet your father,"" said Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter half questioningly. ""It is a long time since you have seen him, isn't it?""<br>
<br>
""Three years,"" Charles Rambert answered, ""and then just for a few minutes. He is coming home from America now, and before that he travelled in Spain for a long time.""<br>
<br>
""He was travelling the whole time you were a child, wasn't he?""<br>
<br>
""Yes, always: either in Colombia, looking after his rubber plantations there, or in Spain, where he has a good deal of property too. When he was in Paris he used to come to the school and ask for me, and I saw him in the parlour—for a quarter of an hour.""<br>
<br>
""And your mother?""<br>
<br>
""Oh, mamma was different. You know, Thérèse, I spent all  the childhood that I can remember at the school. I liked the masters and had good chums, and was very happy there, and if the truth must be told I looked forward with anything but pleasure to the holidays, when I had to go to my parents' house. I always felt a stranger with them; my real home was the school-room, where I had my desk and all my own interests. And then, you know, when one is little one doesn't understand things much; I didn't feel having hardly any family, very much.""<br>
<br>
""But you loved your mother very much?""<br>
<br>
Thérèse asked the question quite anxiously, and it was patent that she would have thought it dreadful if her companion had not had a real affection for his mother.<br>
<br>
""Oh, yes, I loved her,"" Charles Rambert answered; ""but I hardly knew her either."" And as Thérèse showed her surprise he went on, telling her something of the secret of his lonely childhood. ""You see, Thérèse, now that I am a man I guess lots of things that I could not have had even a suspicion of then. My father and mother did not get on well together. They were what you call an ill-assorted couple. They were both very good, but their characters did not harmonise. When I was little I always saw mamma silent and sad, and papa active and on the go, and bright and talking at the top of his voice. I half believe he frightened mamma! And then my father was constantly away, whereas mamma hardly ever went out. When a servant took me to the house on Thursdays, I was taken up to say good morning to her, and I invariably found her lying on a sofa in her room, with the blinds down and almost dark. She just touched me with her lips and asked me one or two questions, and then I was taken away again because I tired her.""<br>
<br>
""Was she ill, then?""<br>
<br>
""Mamma always has been ill. I suppose you know, Thérèse, that three months ago—stay, it was just when I had taken my degree and went to Germany—she was sent to an asylum? I believe my father had wanted her to agree to undergo careful treatment of the kind long before, but she would not.""<br>
<br>
Thérèse was silent for a few minutes.<br>
<br>
""You have not been very happy,"" she said presently.<br>
<br>
""Oh, it was only after I grew up that I felt unhappy. When I was a little chap I never thought of how sad it is to have no real father or mother. The last four or five years it has hurt me, but when he came to see me once at school, papa told me he would take me with him as soon as I had taken my degree and grown up. Last October, after my examination, he wrote and told me to be patient a little longer, and that he was hurrying on with the winding up of his business and coming back to France. That gave me a hope which has brightened these last few months, and will also make you understand why I am so pleased this morning at my fathers coming. It seems to me that a new life is going to begin.""<br>
<br>
Day was breaking now: a dirty December day, with the light filtering through heavy grey clouds that drifted along the ground, hid the horizon, clung to the low hills, and then suddenly dispersed in long wisps driven by a keen breeze, that got up in gusts, and drove clouds of dust along the hard frozen ground.<br>
<br>
""I have not been very happy either,"" said Thérèse, ""for I lost my father when I was tiny: I don't even remember him; and mamma must be dead as well.""<br>
<br>
The ambiguous turning of the child's phrase caught Charles Rambert's interested attention.<br>
<br>
""What does that mean, Thérèse? Don't you know if your mother is dead?""<br>
<br>
""Yes, oh yes; grandmamma says so. But whenever I ask for particulars grandmamma always changes the subject. I will echo what you said just now: when you are little you don't know anything and are not surprised at anything. For a long time I took no notice of her sudden reticence, but now I sometimes wonder if something is not being kept back from me—whether it is really true that mamma is no more in this world.""<br>
<br>
Talking like this Thérèse and Charles had walked at a good pace, and now they came to the few houses built around Verrières station. One by one, bedroom windows and doors were being opened; peasants were making their way to the sheds to lead their cattle to the pastures.<br>
<br>
""We are very early,"" Thérèse remarked, pointing to the station clock in the distance. ""Your father's train is due at 6.55, and it is only 6.40 now; we still have a quarter of an hour to wait, and more, if the train is not punctual!""<br>
<br>
They went into the little station and Charles Rambert, thankful for some shelter from the cold, stamped his feet, making a sudden uproar in the empty waiting-room. A porter appeared.<br>
<br>
""Who the deuce is kicking up all this row?"" he began angrily, and then seeing Thérèse, broke off short. ""Ah, Mademoiselle Thérèse,"" he said with the familiar yet perfectly respectful cordiality that marks country folk, ""up already? Have you come to meet somebody, or are you going away?""<br>
<br>
As he spoke, the porter turned a curious eye upon Charles Rambert, whose arrival had caused quite a sensation two days before in this little spot, where with but few exceptions none but people belonging to the neighbourhood ever came by train.<br>
<br>
""No, I am not going away,"" Thérèse replied. ""I have accompanied M. Rambert, who has come to meet his father.""<br>
<br>
""Ah-ha, to meet your papa, sir: is he coming from far?""<br>
<br>
""From Paris,"" Charles Rambert answered. ""Is the train signalled yet?""<br>
<br>
The man drew out a watch like a turnip, and looked at the time.<br>
<br>
""It won't be here for quite another twenty minutes. The work on the tunnel makes it necessary to be careful, and it's always late now. But you will hear when the bell rings: that will be when the train is coming over the level-crossing; it will run into the station three minutes after that. Well, Mademoiselle, I must get on with my work,"" and the man left them.<br>
<br>
Thérèse turned to Charles Rambert.<br>
<br>
""Shall we go on to the platform? Then we shall see the train come in.""<br>
<br>
So they left the waiting-room and began to walk up and down the whole length of the platform. Thérèse watched the jerky movements of the hands of the clock, and smiled at her companion.<br>
<br>
""Five minutes more, and your father will be here! Four minutes more! Ah! There it is!"" and she pointed to a slope in the distance where a slight trail of smoke rose white against the blue of the sky, now clear of cloud. ""Can't you see it? That is the steam from the engine coming out of the tunnel.""<br>
<br>
Ere she finished speaking the quivering whir of the bell echoed through the empty station.<br>
<br>
""Ah!"" said Charles Rambert: ""at last!""<br>
<br>
The two porters who, with the stationmaster, constituted the entire railway staff at Verrières, came bustling along the platform, and while the bell continued its monotonous whirring ring, pulled forward trucks in readiness for any possible luggage. Puffing portentously, the engine slackened speed, and the heavy train slowed down and finally stopped, bringing a noisy atmosphere of life into the station of Verrières that but a moment ago was so still.<br>
<br>
The first-class carriages had stopped immediately in front of Charles and Thérèse, and on the footboard Etienne Rambert stood, a tall, elderly man of distinguished appearance, proud bearing and energetic attitude, with extraordinarily keen eyes and an unusually high and intelligent forehead. Seeing Thérèse and Charles he seized his baggage and in a twinkling had sprung on to the platform. He dropped his valise, tossed his bundle of rugs on to a seat, and gripped Charles by the two shoulders.<br>
<br>
""My boy!"" he exclaimed; ""my dear boy!""<br>
<br>
Although he had hitherto shown so little affection for his child, it was obvious that the man was making a great effort to restrain his emotion, and was really moved when he now saw him again as a grown young man.<br>
<br>
Nor, on his part, did Charles Rambert remain unmoved. As if the sudden grip of this almost stranger, who yet was his father, had awakened a world of memories within him, he turned very pale and his voice faltered as he replied:<br>
<br>
""Papa! Dear papa! I am so glad to see you!""<br>
<br>
Thérèse had drawn tactfully aside. M. Rambert still held his son by the shoulders and stepped back a pace, the better to consider him.<br>
<br>
""Why, you are a man! How you have altered, my boy! You are just what I hoped you would be: tall and strong! Ah, you are my son all right! And you are quite well, hey? Yet you look tired.""<br>
<br>
""I did not sleep well,"" Charles explained with a smile. ""I was afraid I should not wake up.""<br>
<br>
Turning his head, M. Rambert saw Thérèse and held out his hand.<br>
<br>
""How do you do, my little Thérèse?"" he exclaimed. ""You have altered too since I saw you last. I left a little chit of a child, and now I behold a grown-up young lady. Well! I must be off at once to pay my respects to my dear old friend, your grandmother. All well at the château, eh?""<br>
<br>
Thérèse shook hands warmly with M. Rambert and thanked him prettily.<br>
<br>
""Grandmamma is very well; she told me to tell you to excuse her if she did not come to meet you, but her doctor says she must not get up very early.""<br>
<br>
""Of course your grandmamma is excused, my dear. Besides, I have to thank her for her kindness to Charles, and for the hospitality she is going to extend to me for a few days.""<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the train had gone on again, and now a porter came up to M. Rambert.<br>
<br>
""Will you take your luggage with you, sir?""<br>
<br>
Recalled to material things, Etienne Rambert contemplated his trunk which the porters had taken out of the luggage van.<br>
<br>
""Good Lord!"" he began, but Thérèse interrupted him.<br>
<br>
""Grandmamma said she would send for your heavy luggage during the morning, and that you could take your valise and any small parcels with us in the brougham.""<br>
<br>
""What's that? Your grandmamma has taken the trouble to send her carriage?""<br>
<br>
""It's a long way to Beaulieu, you know,"" Thérèse replied. ""Ask Charles if it isn't. We came on foot and the walk would be too tiring for you after a whole night in the train.""<br>
<br>
The three had reached the station yard, and Thérèse stopped in surprise.<br>
<br>
""Why, how's that?"" she exclaimed; ""the carriage is not here.  And yet Jean was beginning to get it ready when we left the château.""<br>
<br>
M. Etienne Rambert was resting one hand on his son's shoulder, and contemplating him with an affectionate, all-embracing survey every now and then. He smiled at Thérèse.<br>
<br>
""He may have been delayed, dear. I tell you what we will do. Since your grandmamma is going to send for my luggage there is no need for me to take my valise; we can leave everything in the cloak-room and start for the château on foot; if my memory serves me right—and it is a very good memory—there is only one road, so we shall meet Jean and can get into the carriage on the way.""<br>
<br>
A few minutes later all three set out on the road to Beaulieu. M. Rambert walked between the two young people; he had gallantly offered his arm to Thérèse, who was not a little proud of the attention, which proved to her mind that she was now regarded as a grown-up young lady. On the other side of his father Charles made answer to the incessant questions put to him.<br>
<br>
M. Etienne Rambert enjoyed the walk in the quiet morning through the peaceful country-side. With a tender half-melancholy he recognised every turn in the road, every bit of scenery.<br>
<br>
""Just fancy my coming back here at sixty years of age, with a great son of eighteen!"" he said with a laugh. ""And I remember as if it were yesterday the good times I have had at the château of Beaulieu. Mme. de Langrune and I will have plenty of memories to talk over. Gad! it must be quite forty years since I came this way, and yet I remember every bit of it. Say, Thérèse, isn't it the fact that we shall see the front of the château directly we have passed this little copse?""<br>
<br>
""Quite true,"" the girl answered with a laugh. ""You know the country very well, sir.""<br>
<br>
""Yes,"" said Etienne Rambert; ""when one gets to my age, little Thérèse, one always does remember the happy days of one's youth; one remembers recent events much less distinctly. Most likely that means, my dear, that the human heart declines to grow old and refuses to preserve any but pictures of childhood.""<br>
<br>
For a few minutes M. Rambert remained silent, as if absorbed in somewhat melancholy reflections. But he soon recovered himself and shook off the tender sadness evoked in his mind by memories of the past.<br>
<br>
""Why, the park enclosure has been altered,"" he exclaimed. ""Here is a wall which used not to be here: there was only a hedge.""<br>
<br>
Thérèse laughed.<br>
<br>
""I never knew the hedge,"" she said. ""I have always seen the wall.""<br>
<br>
""Must we go on to the main gate?"" M. Rambert asked, ""or has your grandmamma had another gate made?""<br>
<br>
""We are going in by the out-buildings,"" the girl answered; ""then we shall hear why Jean did not come to meet us."" She opened a little door half-hidden among the moss and ivy that clothed the wall surrounding the park, and making M. Rambert and Charles pass in before her, cried: ""But Jean has gone with the brougham, for the horses are not in the stable. How was it we did not meet him?"" Then she laughed. ""Poor Jean! He is so muddle-headed! I would not mind betting he went to meet us at Saint-Jaury, as he does every morning to bring me home from church.""<br>
<br>
The little company, Etienne Rambert, Thérèse and Charles, were now approaching the château. Passing beneath Mme. de Langrune's windows Thérèse called merrily up to them.<br>
<br>
""Here we are, grandmamma!""<br>
<br>
There was no reply.<br>
<br>
But at the window of an adjoining room appeared the figure of the steward, Dollon, making a gesture, as if asking for silence.<br>
<br>
Thérèse, in advance of her guests, had proceeded but a few yards when Mme. de Langrune's old servant rushed down the stone flight of steps in front of the château, towards M. Rambert.<br>
<br>
Dollon seemed distraught. Usually so respectful and so deferential in manner, he now seized M. Rambert by the arm, and imperiously waving Thérèse and Charles away, drew him aside.<br>
<br>
""It is awful, sir,"" he exclaimed: ""horrible: a fearful thing has happened. We have just found Mme. la Marquise dead—murdered—in her room!""</p>

<br>
[Verso 1: Los Dareyes De La Sierra &amp; <i>Peso Pluma</i>]<br>
Me humillaron sin saber quién soy<br>
Juzgan a la gente por el billete que ganó<br>
No se dan cuenta que pa' hacerlo hay que ser más cabrón<br>
Y al que miraban para abajo la vuelta les dio<br>
<i>Diamantes en el cuello, </i><i>VVS<br>
Y a veces me visto de Gucci de frente a los pies<br>
Relojes Rolex y Cartier ahí tengo como diez<br>
La camioneta de mis sueños ya</i><i> me la compré</i><br>
<br>
[Pre-Coro: Edgardo Nuñez]<br>
Y si me dicen presumido por vivir como yo vivo<br>
Yo solo disfruto dе las cosas porque jalo un chingo<br>
Se fijan en los billеtes, no en lo que en realidad vale<br>
La lealtad de un buen amigo, sigo siendo el mismo de antes<br>
Me hablan los interesado', obvio voy a contestarles<br>
<br>
[Coro: Los Dareyes De La Sierra]<br>
Pa' mandarlos a la verga, no soy pendejo de nadie<br>
Sigo firme con los míos, aquel que supo ayudarme<br>
Ellos tienen mi respeto y siempre voy a apoyarles<br>
<br>
[Interludio: Edgardo Nuñez, <i>Peso Pluma</i> &amp; <b>Los Dareyes De La Sierra</b>]<br>
Y pa' que sigan hablando, viejo<br>
Pura Doble P, ¿qué no?<br>
<i>¡Cha-chau!<br>
Puro 602, compa Edgardo<br>
Compa Darey</i><br>
<b>¡Fierro Colorado, compa Peso!<br>
¡Jálese, compa Edgardo!</b><br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Peso Pluma &amp; <i>Edgardo Nuñez</i>]<br>
Yo soy humilde aunque ahora me va bien<br>
No le falto el respeto a nadie, saben que soy ley<br>
Aborrezco al envidioso y eso lo sé ver<br>
Siempre habla mal de los otros, menos de lo de él<br>
<i>A puro desvelo armé un cantón<br>
Y logré hacer mucho billete y ayudé al viejón<br>
Me miran que ando en deportivos, todos del año<br>
No me importa lo que me digan, yo sé bien quién soy</i><br>

Y si me dicen presumido por vivir como yo vivo<br>
<i>Yo solo disfruto de la cosas porque jalo un chingo<br>
Se fijan en los billetes, no en lo que en realidad vale<br>
La lealtad de un buen amigo, sigo siendo el mismo de antes<br>
Me hablan los interesados, obvio voy a contestarles</i><br>

[Coro: Peso Pluma &amp; <i>Edgardo Nuñez</i>]<br>
Pa' mandarlos a la verga, no soy pendejo de nadie<br>
Sigo firme con los míos, aquel que supo ayudarme<br>
<i>Ellos tienen mi respeto y siempre voy a apoyarle<br>
Y aquí se está haciendo tarde</i></p>

I ain't spotless, <i>neither is you<br>
For once in my life, I'm gonna see it through<br>
If you want spotless, I'll always lose<br>
You gave me your love, lover, you gave me the truth</i><br>
<br>
[Bridge: Wesley Schultz]<br>
I was alone<br>
You were bettin' on a loser, you were calling my bluff<br>
Holding one another, is it never enough?<br>
You were right there with me<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Wesley Schultz &amp; Zach Bryan]<br>
I can't stop this, neither can you<br>
For once in my life, I'm down to see it through<br>

"<p>[Chorus]<br>
Happy holiday<br>
Happy holiday<br>
While the merry bells keep ringing<br>
Happy holidays to you!<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
It's the holiday season<br>
And Santa Claus is coming 'round<br>
The Christmas snow is white on the ground<br>
When ol' Santa gets into town<br>
He'll be coming down the chimney, down!<br>
(He'll be coming down the chimney, down!)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
It's the holiday season<br>
And Santa Claus has got a toy<br>
For every good girl and good little boy<br>
Santa's a great big bundle of joy<br>
When he's coming down the chimney, down!<br>
(When he's coming down the chimney, down!)<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back<br>
And lots of goodies for you and for me<br>
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick<br>
Hanging on the Christmas tree!<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
It's the holiday season<br>
(The holiday season)<br>
With the whoop-de-do and dickory dock<br>
And don't forget to hang up your sock<br>
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock<br>
He'll be coming down the chimney, down!<br>
(He'll be coming down the chimney, down!)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back<br>
And lots of goodies for you and for me<br>
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick<br>
Hanging on the Christmas tree<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
It's the holiday season<br>
(The holiday season)<br>
With the whoop-de-do and dickory dock<br>
And don't forget to hang up your sock<br>
'Cause at just exactly at 12 o'clock<br>
He'll be coming down the chimney<br>
Coming down the chimney<br>
Coming down the chimney, down!<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back<br>
And lots of goodies for you and me<br>
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick<br>
Hanging on the Christmas tree<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
It's the holiday season<br>
With the whoop-de-do and hickory dock<br>
And don't forget to hang up your sock<br>
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock<br>
He'll be coming down the chimney<br>
Coming down the chimney<br>
Coming down the chimney, down!<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back<br>
And lots of goodies for you and me<br>
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick<br>
Hanging on the Christmas tree<br>

Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>
Same old tired, lonely place<br>
Walls of insincerity<br>
Shifting eyes and vacancy</a><br>
Vanished when I saw your face<br>
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""<br>
Across the room, your silhouette<br>
Starts to make its way to me<br>

Counter all your quick remarks<br>
Like passing notes in secrecy<br>
And it was enchanting to meet you<br>
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you<br>

""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""<br>
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you<br>

Rap Critic here. Let's talk about Pitbull…</a><br>
<br>
So, how do you talk about a rapper who has nothing to say?<br>
<br>
I mean, I can't remember one song from this man that DIDN'T talk about being in a club. As far as I remember, his topics range from ""party party party, and drink, drink, drink"" to ""party party party, and drink, drink, drink … but, like, in another country this time!"". <a href=""/2839532/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-timber-by-pitbul-feat-ke-ha/Geez-even-sean-paul-did-a-love-song-every-once-in-a-while"" data-id=""2839532"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">Geez, even Sean Paul did a love song every once in a while!</a> And I don't have a problem with party music in general, far from it, it's just that anything involving Pitbull's music has a very… processed feel to it, like a prepackaged, factory-sealed, product. Every one of his mini-verses seem like such cliff notes versions of rap music tropes, it's insulting<br>
<br>
Like, dude, come on, LIE TO ME. Can you at least pretend like you're more than ""the go-to guy for optional rap verses on pop songs""? You know how on some radio stations, they'll cut out the rap verse of a song, leaving you with 30 seconds of an awkward voiceless backtrack, as you rap along to words that you could swear were there the last time you heard it? ""California Gurls"". Yeah, because apparently there's still a large amount of people out there who just can't stand the thought of rappers in popular music, so much so that there are radio stations across the country who market themselves on the idea that, ""Hey, if you listen to us, you don't have to wory about all that pesky rap nonsense that's ruining music!"" *play intro to ""California Gurls"". Wait, they even cut him out of the intro? He's not even rapping there!<br>
<br>
I have NEVER heard of something like this happen to other genres of music. I've never heard of a radio station dedicated to editing out violins and saxophone solos from songs because some people don't like jazz or classical music. In fact, I've never heard of a rap station that prides itself on cutting pop singers out of rap songs, but when it comes to rappers on pop songs, people are still saying ""get that damn talky noise out of my ear,"" so much so that you can bank your radio station's appeal on that sentiment alone? That's… disappointing, to say the least. Wait, who were we talking about again? Oh yeah, Pitbull. Sorry, I got distracted by something interesting...<br>
<br>
But yeah, Pitbull to me, always ends up sounding like a guest artist on his own songs most of the time. In fact, I'm surprised no radio station's gotten confused and accidentally cut the the rap verses out of his own songs. <a href=""/2839464/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-timber-by-pitbul-feat-ke-ha/Example-of-pitbulls-song-being-edited"" data-id=""2839464"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">*example of Pitbull's song being edited*</a><br>
<br>
<a href=""/2839470/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-timber-by-pitbul-feat-ke-ha/You-know-i-reviewed-a-flo-rida-song-a-year-or-so-ago"" data-id=""2839470"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">You know, I reviewed a Flo Rida song a year or so ago</a>, and the only reason I decided to do so was because it was called ""I Cry"", and a title like that meant that maybe he would say something I could actually make a full episode ago. And, well, he did say a few things, but for the most part, it was kinda typical. But hey, at least there was that initial interest. Now, <a href=""/2839473/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-timber-by-pitbul-feat-ke-ha/Pitbulls-a-little-different-from-flo-in-that-admittedly-his-spanish-heritage-gives-him-a-a-little-bit-of-flavor-to-his-lyrics"" data-id=""2839473"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">Pitbull's a little different from Flo, in that, admittedly, his Spanish heritage gives him a a little bit of flavor to his lyrics</a>, but not in a really substantial way. But, like Flo Rida, I figure if I do hear a song from that sounds like it'll stand out, I give it a try<br>
<br>
Then, I heard this song, ""Timber"". *song intro* Well that's…certainly different. A country western rap song from a guy from Cuba and a woman who was obviously raised in… in… Nashville, Tennessee? Oh… well, she doesn't sound like it! *beat switches to typical club music* Uh… and neither does this song anymore. Really, the harmonica is the only thing keeping the country theme together. And yeah, <a href=""/2839478/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-timber-by-pitbul-feat-ke-ha/The-sample-comes-from-a-70s-bluesy-song"" data-id=""2839478"" data-editorial-state=""accepted"" data-classification=""accepted"">the sample comes from a 70's bluesy song</a>, but… look at this video. I think you know what they're going for<br>
<br>
It’s going down, I’m yelling timber<br>
You better move<br>
<br>
I will say, that's a relatively witty, catchy first lyric. Unfortunately, I wouldn't say it's strong enough to build a whole song around,  but given how generic the rest of the chorus is, it leads me to believe that that first lyric was the only reason this song was made.  Like, they were thinking, ""Hey, guys, how's this: ""it's going down... like someone shouted timber, get it?"" And… uh… rednecks like trees, right? Rednecks, lumberjacks, same thing, am I right? Am I right, fellas? No, seriously, is that right? I don't know…<br>
<br>
""Let's make a night *Or, a song* you won't remember""<br>
<br>
Okay, let's stop wasting time. Let's get to pit bull. So basically, let's waste more time...<br>
<br>
The bigger they are, the harder they fall<br>
<br>
Okay, that's not a bad opener, continuing with the trees-slash-party metaphor, in that the bigger the tree or the bigger the party, the more intensely hard it's gonna go down. That's… ok<br>
<br>
This biggity boy’s a dignity dog<br>
<br>
Also, I appreciate the callback to the 90's with the Das EFX's placement of ""iggety"" in the middle of words, which is fitting, because it pays homage to the HipHop tradition that, even back in the 90's, rappers could get famous off of spitting a bunch of unimportant nonsense. Seriously, listen to ""They Want EFX"" and tell me it held some deep message about the human condition:<br>
<br>
My thigh bone's connected to my knee bone<br>
My knee bone's connected to my hardy-har-har-har<br>
<br>
No Parks sausages, mom, please<br>

<br>
B - I - N - G - O-oh<br>
You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, hon, so uh<br>
Dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure those guys just got high and tried to reference everything from their childhood as quickly as possible. Hm… I wonder if they went on to write for Family Guy. *play ""Price is Right"" loser horn, look to camera, shrug shoulders*<br>
<br>

<br>
""FACE DOWN, ASS UP, THAT'S THE WAY WE LIK TO FUCK""<br>
<br>
And he's not making a joke about it, he sounds like he was tapped on the shoulder and told to make the lyric less explicit by saying ""booty"" instead ass and saying ""that's the way we like to WHAAT!?"" like his parents just walked in while he was recording the lyrics<br>
<br>
""Face down, booty up, that's the way we like to WHAT!?! Mom, dad, you weren't supposed to be in the studio today?!<br>
<br>
Look, when the only reason you're self-censoring your words is so because you're actively trying to be more radio friendly, then just erase the lyrics and say something else!<br>
<br>
Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane<br>
Nah, it’s just me, ain’t a damn thing changed<br>
<br>
I guess that's an okay reference, saying that even though people may seem him as someone whose ego's reached a great height as far as fame and wealth are concerned, he's still a down to earth guy, but… when you watch the video, it ruins any charm it might have had. He just looks so smug about a line that wasn't really that great. *show his face* Get it, I compared myself to superman, hehe… well, I thought it was funny…*<br>
<br>
Club jumping like Lebron, now Voli<br>
<br>
You know, I would be angry about this blatant interruption of the song for the sole purpose of product placement, but honestly, I'll take this over what he did on the ""Give Me Everything"" song, which, at the very start of the song, synergized repetition of product placement with the fact that rhyming words with themselves has become openly accepted as a way to rap in order to give us this gem:<br>
<br>
Me not working hard?<br>
Yeah, right! Picture that with a Kodak<br>
Or, better yet, go to Times Square<br>
Take a picture of me with a Kodak<br>
<br>
Why yes, Pitbull DID have a deal with Kodak. How did you know? Well, anyways, let's get back to the verse:<br>
<br>
Swing your partner round and round<br>
End of the night, it’s going down<br>
One more shot, another round<br>
End of the night, it’s going down<br>
<br>
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have skipped to the bridge near the end of the song, let's back up by about 45 seconds<br>
<br>
Swing your partner round and round<br>
End of the night, it’s going down<br>
<br>
Wait, I'm sorry, I went too far back! Now, we're in the middle of the first verse, and… wait, keep playing that part<br>
<br>
One more shot, another round<br>
End of the night, it’s going down<br>
<br>
…No… This man, instead of making two full verses, just repeated a two bar phrase for the second  half of BOTH verses. You… cheater!!! Dude, n… really? You just COULDN'T be bothered to write two complete verses? I mean, hey, I guess that makes both our jobs easier. Whatever, you know what? I give this a 2 out of 5<br>
<br>
You could give this song credit for trying to do the country western approach with the harmonica, and the intro that sounds like a more bluesy/country western feel. And to Pit's credit, he's... just not on the song long enough to annoy me. His mannerisms are there, but they're tolerable. Well, except for the ""just repeat one phrase to substitute as the second half of the verse"" thing. It's so obviously jarring to hear, because to my ear, it truly feels like he ran out of things to say and just plugged in the bridge that was supposed to go at the end to make up for unfinished verses. As well, after a while, the phrase ""it's going down"" is used so much, it starts to feel like one of the writers was someone's out-of-touch dad who just figured out what ""it's going down"" meant, and REALLY wanted his kids to know that he was hip to the lingo<br>
<br>
It's goin' down<br>
It's going down<br>
It's goin' down<br>
It's going down<br>
It's goin' down<br>
IT'S, ABOUT, TO GO, DOWN!<br>
<br>
After a while it starts to feel forced, like they're TRYING to make it popular, or people JUST started saying it and they're trying to make it the new Y.O.L.O. or something, but it doesn't have enough personality or catchiness to do so. Well, I'm the Rap Critic!<br>
<br>
You don't have to like my opinion, but I don't have to like your song...</p>

"<p>""Give Me Everything""<br>
(feat. Ne-Yo, Afrojack, Nayer)<br>
<br>
Me not working hard?<br>
Yeah, right! Picture that with a Kodak<br>
Or, better yet, go to Times Square<br>
Take a picture of me with a Kodak<br>
Took my life from negative to positive<br>
I just want y'all know that<br>
And tonight, let's enjoy life<br>
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo<br>
That's right<br>
<br>
Tonight I want all of you tonight<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
For all we know we might not get tomorrow<br>
Let's do it tonight<br>
<br>
Don't care what they say<br>
Or what games they play<br>
Nothing is enough<br>
'Til I have your love<br>
<br>
Let's do it tonight<br>
<br>
I want you tonight<br>
I want you to stay<br>
I want you tonight<br>
<br>
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
<br>
Take advantage of tonight<br>
Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess<br>
But tonight, I can make you my queen<br>
And make love to you endless<br>
This is insane: the way the name growin'<br>
Money keep flowin'<br>
Hustlers move aside<br>
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'<br>
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan<br>
<br>
Put it on my life, baby<br>
I make you feel right, baby<br>
Can't promise tomorrow<br>
But, I promise tonight<br>
Dalé<br>
<br>
Excuse me (Excuse Me)<br>
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight<br>
And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight<br>
And, baby, Ima make you feel so good, tonight<br>
Cause we might not get tomorrow<br>

<br>
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
Give me everything tonight<br>
<br>
Reach for the stars<br>
And if you don't grab 'em<br>
At least you'll fall on top of the world<br>
Think about it<br>
Cause if you slip<br>
I'm gon' fall on top yo girl (hahaa)<br>
What I'm involved with<br>
Is deeper than the masons<br>
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret<br>
My family's from Cuba<br>
But I'm an American Idol<br>
Get money like Seacrest<br>
<br>
Put it on my life, baby<br>
I make you feel right, baby<br>
Can't promise tomorrow<br>
But, I promise tonight<br>
Dalé<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""Hips Don't Lie"" (feat. Wyclef Jean) [Live]]<br>
<br>
[Intro]<br>
Let me introduce you<br>
To one of the most talented men I know<br>
My friend, the genius<br>
Wyclef Jean!<br>
<br>
I wanna see you dance, yeah!<br>
<br>
Here we go!<br>
Put your hands in the air!<br>
Put your hands in the air!<br>
Here we go<br>
¡Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!<br>
Put your hands in the air!<br>
Put your hands in the air!<br>
Put your hands in the air!<br>
Hey<br>
Shakira, Shakira<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean &amp; <i>Shakira</i>]<br>
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)<br>
She make a man wanna speak Spanish<br>
¿Cómo se llama? (¡Sí!), ¿bonita? (¡Sí!)<br>
Shakira, Shakira<br>
<i>Oh, baby, when you talk like that</i> (Oh!)<br>
<i>You make a woman go mad</i> (Come on!)<br>
<i>So be wise</i> (¡Sí!), <i>and keep on</i> (¡Sí!)<br>
<i>Reading the signs of my body</i> (Put your hands up!)<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Shakira &amp; <i>Wyclef Jean</i>]<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
You know my hips don’t lie<br>
And I'm starting to feel you, boy (<i>Come on!)</i><br>
Come on, let's go (<i>Sí!)</i><br>
Real slow (<i>Sí!)</i><br>
Don’t you see, baby? This is perfection<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]<br>
Hey, girl, I can see your body moving<br>
And it's driving me crazy<br>
And I didn't have the slightest idea<br>
Until I saw you dancing<br>
And when you walk up on the dance floor, nobody cannot ignore<br>
The way you move your body, girl<br>
And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it<br>
So you can keep on shakin' it<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean &amp; <i>Shakira</i>]<br>
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)<br>
She make a man wanna speak Spanish<br>
¿Cómo se llama? (¡Sí!), ¿bonita? (¡Sí!)<br>
Mi casa<br>
Shakira, Shakira<br>
<i>Oh, baby, when you talk like that</i> (Oh!)<br>
<i>You make a woman go mad</i> (Oh!)<br>
<i>So be wise (¡Sí!), and keep on</i> (¡Sí!)<br>
<i>Reading the signs of my body</i> (Wave your hands like this!)<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Shakira &amp; <i>Wyclef Jean</i>]<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
You know my hips don't lie<br>
And I'm starting to feel you, boy<br>
Come on, let’s go (<i>¡Sí!)</i><br>
Real slow (<i>¡Sí!)</i><br>
Don’t you see, baby? This is perfection<br>
They know I'm on tonight<br>
My hips don’t lie and I'm starting to feel it's right<br>
All the attraction (<i>¡Sí!)</i><br>
The tension (<i>¡Sí!)</i><br>
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Shakira]<br>
Oh, boy, I can see your body movin’, half-animal, half-man<br>
I don't, don't really know what I'm doin'<br>
But you seem to have a plan<br>
My will and self-restraint have come to fail now, fail now<br>
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so, you know<br>
That's a bit too hard to explain<br>
<br>
[Bridge: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]<br>
Baila en la calle de noche<br>
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)<br>
Baila en la calle de noche<br>
Baila en la calle de día<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean &amp; <i>Shakira</i>]<br>
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)<br>
She make a man wanna speak Spanish<br>
¿Cómo se llama? (¡Sí!), ¿bonita? (¡Sí!)<br>
Shakira, Shakira<br>
<i>Oh, baby, when you talk like that</i> (Oh!)<br>
<i>You know you got me hypnotized</i> (Oh!)<br>
So be wise (¡Sí), and keep on (¡Sí!)<br>
Readin' the signs of my body<br>
<br>
[Refrain: Wyclef Jean &amp; Shakira]<br>
Señorita, feel the conga<br>
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia<br>
<i>Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!</i><br>
En Barranquilla se baila así<br>
¡Barranquillero'!<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]<br>
Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy<br>
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country<br>
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty<br>
We leave the whole club dizzy<br>
Why the CIA wanna watch us?<br>
It's the Colombians and Haitians<br>
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction<br>
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes<br>
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Shakira &amp; <i>Wyclef Jean</i>]<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
My hips don't lie, and I'm starting to feel you, boy<br>
Come on, let's go (<i>Si!)</i><br>
Real slow (<i>Si!)</i><br>
Baby, like this is perfection<br>
They know I'm on tonight (<i>Come on!)</i><br>
My hips don't lie, and I'm starting to feel it's right<br>
All the attraction,(<i>Si!)</i><br>
The tension(<i>Si!)</i><br>
Baby, like this is perfection<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
I'm on tonight, come on!<br>
Everybody, jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!<br>
I'm on tonight, go!<br>
Sean Pauñ, happy birthday! Let's go!!<br>
Come on, come on!<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
Everybody, jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
Go Shaki, go Shaki, go!<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
If you from Miami, put your hands in the air!<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
Go Shaki, go Shaki, go!<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
¡Cumbia de mi tierra!<br>
Come on!<br>
Put your hands in the air! Come on!<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Shakira &amp; Wyclef Jean]<br>
I'm on tonight<br>
You know my hips don't lie<br>
And I'm starting to feel you, boy (Come on!)<br>
Come on, let's go, (¡Sí!)<br>
Real slow (Put your hands up!)<br>
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection (Put your hands up!)<br>
They know I'm on tonight<br>
You know my hips don't lie<br>
And I'm starting to feel it's right (Come on!)<br>
All the attraction (¡Sí!)<br>
The tension (¡Sí!)<br>
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection<br>
<br>
[Outro: Wyclef Jean &amp; Shakira]<br>
No fighting tonight!<br>
No fighting!<br>
No fighting, right, people?<br>
Shakira, Shakira<br>
¡Gracias!<br>
¡Gracias, Wyclef!<br>
Thank you!<br>
Thank you so much!<br>
Make some noise!<br>
Make some noise!<br>
Put your hands in the air!<br>
Put your hands up!<br>
¡Gracias!<br>
¡Hasta siempre!<br>
¡Los quiero mucho!</p>

"<p>[Letra de ""Mas Altas Que Bajadas""]<br>
<br>
[Intro]<br>
Aún recuerdo cuando empezaba, la feria no la buscaba<br>
Pero cuando le echas ganas más te ayuda Dios<br>
El pedo aquí está en la jugada<br>
Si le pegas todo, ganas, si no, regresas con nada<br>
Y así pensé yo<br>
<br>
[Puente Instrumental]<br>
<br>
[Verso 1]<br>
Hoy son más altas que bajadas, ya no me humillan pa' nada<br>
La ropita no es prestada, me la compré yo<br>
La vida no está tan pelada y fácil como yo pensaba<br>
Pero chale, peor es nada, y pa' adelante voy<br>
Usaba la ropa tumbada, y tumbada sigue luciendo<br>
Solo que se elevó mucho el precio al marcador<br>
El Cartier dice que es mi tiempo, dos ochitos de veneno y una corta<br>
Mi San Judas, protegido estoy<br>
Los Ángeles, del mero centro, pa' que ustedes vayan viendo de dónde proviene el morro que salió un cabrón<br>
Mis hijas es lo que más quiero, si me las tocan me prendo<br>
Ya se sabe que no miento, no soy fanfarrón<br>
Con huevos y con la cortita, nadie le atora un topón<br>
<br>
[Interludio Instrumental]<br>
<br>
[Verso 2]<br>
En los aires tengo mi casa, mirando a todo el que pasa<br>
De aquí arriba no se escuchan, ládrenle mejor<br>
El Mercedes no se me raja<br>
Nomás basta una llamada pa' llegarle y desde una tumbarle el cantón<br>
Me superé y fue de la nada<br>
Me gustó la vida cara, los diamantes, la ropita de diseñador<br>
De cien, si no, no quiero nada<br>
La máquina pa' contar la feria porque es un vergazo lo que muevo yo<br>
Antes la andábamos perreando pero la cosa cambió<br>

"<p>In the 40-plus years since their 1975 formation, Iron Maiden have served as the embodiment of all that defines heavy metal. In this fan-validated genre, they’ve done everything on their own terms, even back in their earliest days where they refused to conform to punk standards in order to secure a record deal. The unwavering Steve Harris had a vision, compromising nothing (except maybe for the tempo of “Flight of Icarus”) as Iron Maiden’s timeless songs and mythical stage productions won fans over worldwide with little help from the mainstream so many of their peers thrived on.<br>
<br>
Boasting, in our estimation, the strongest catalog in metal, ranking every song from Eddie and the boys was a daunting but welcome challenge. Each song a storybook of sorts, Iron Maiden have taken their listeners through the war-torn skies where fighter pilots clashed in World War II, ushered the condemned on the lonely walk to the gallows, traveled back to ancient Egypt where men became gods (not a far cry from their immortal heavy metal status) and through other historic moments and realms of fantastic escape through literature and film.<br>
<br>
Even in the 21st century, Iron Maiden’s output has contested their stunning seven album streak in the ‘80s. Not content to resign themselves to being a greatest hits band, they’ve alternated album tours with nods to specific eras in their past, demonstrating the staying power of their entire catalog, even resurrecting two classics from the divisive Blaze Bayley era on their 2018 “Legacy of the Beast” tour.<br>
<br>
No other band has maintained such a level of dominance for so long, a notion that becomes soberingly evident as you scroll through our ranking of Iron Maiden’s songs below, with dozens of fan-favorites appearing well beyond the 75 mark.<br>
<br>
Up the irons today, tomorrow and for all eternity — even if eternity should fail.<br>
<br>
Every Iron Maiden Song Ranked From Worst to Best<br>
Scroll through the gallery to see how we ranked every song Iron Maiden have written.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>165. ""The Angel and the Gambler"" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)</b><br>
The Blaze Bayley era of Iron Maiden coincided with a massive downturn in the acceptance of ‘80s heavy metal. The band was clearly struggling, and “The Angel and the Gambler” is the biggest miss of their career from the chintzy “Baba O’Reilly” ripoff to the cartoon soundboard orchestration to the painstakingly repetitive chorus that goes on for three minutes more than it should have. Now, onto better things...<br>
<br>
<b>164. ""Weekend Warrior"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
If there’s one thing we didn’t want Iron Maiden to write a song about, it was football (they call it “football,” we call it “soccer”). Okay, football hooliganism in this case, but “Weekend Warrior” was still a lyrical square peg in a heavy metal world full of dragon and/or spaceship-shaped holes. Just so you know. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>163. ""I Live My Way"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
Only available on the 12-inch vinyl version of the “Man On The Edge” single, “I Live My Way” probably wins an award for being one of the most obscure Maiden songs. Sadly, it’s not one of the most memorable. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>162. ""Burning Ambition"" - ""Running Free"" Single (1980)</b><br>
Easily the worst song Maiden recorded with Paul Di’Anno, it doesn’t fit in with the rest of the output from that era. Had they continued down this road, they’d be little more than a mainstream leaning hard rock band. It makes an interesting B-side to “Running Free,” but we’re glad it didn’t make the cut for the band’s flawless self-titled debut. (BI)<br>
<br>
<b>161. ""Nodding Donkey Blues"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
Iron Maiden never were a blues band but they definitely know how to have fun with the genre. This B-side to “Be Quick Or Be Dead” is a prime example. Let’s just say that this song is kind of their tongue-in-cheek version of “Whole Lotta Rosie.” Bonus: a boogie-woogie piano solo, during which Bruce deadpans “There should be some kind of guitar solo here…” (BI)<br>
<br>
<b>160. ""Quest for Fire"" - 'Piece of Mind' (1983)</b><br>
Welcome to the worst Iron Maiden song of the ‘80s. Films have provided Maiden with rich lyrical inspiration, but on “Quest for Fire,” they tread in the shallowest of waters, nicking the 1981 film of the same name (which was adapted from the 1911 book of the same name) for a source material. It’s a ham-fisted attempt to write about early man’s discovery of fire and the subsequent pursuit for those precious embers, but it comes across as a drunken studio romp rife with hokey riffing and bottom-feeding lyrics. For all the classics Harris gave us, he’s earned at least one pass. He’s lucky “The Trooper” is also on ‘Piece of Mind.’ (JD)<br>
<br>
<b>159. ""Como Estais Amigos"" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)</b><br>
It turned out to be Blaze Bayley’s swan song, but “Como Estasis Amigos” was one of the few songs on ‘Virtual XI’ that really put his voice to good use. Unfortunately, the album’s thin sonics and fatal lack of urgency made this a less emotional finale than it could’ve been. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>158. ""Black Bart Blues"" - ""Can I Play With Madness"" Single (1988)</b><br>
The B-side to “Can I Play With Madness?” could have been called “OK, Now I’m Playing With Madness!” It’s easy to imagine that, after working on the heavy and proggy ‘Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son,’ Maiden wanted to have some light-hearted fun. This Van Halen-like jam definitely is fun, and also pretty bonkers: the lyrics are about “Black Bart,” allegedly a suit of armor that the band picked up on their adventures. Somehow Bart meets a woman with a mysterious background: “Don't know where she's been/Maybe she's an acrobat/Spends her evenings dancing on a pole.” If that’s not weird enough, Bruce Dickinson argues with a high pitched character during the song, and just when you think that the song is finished, Nicko McBrain takes over and screws around for about two more minutes. It’s too weird to describe, but you can find the track on YouTube and check it out. (BI)<br>
<br>
<b>157. ""The Apparition"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
One of those songs that probably seemed like a good idea at the time, “The Apparition” brought a staccato funk vibe to the Maiden table. Something like that, anyway. The instrumental and solo sections are great, but the verses verge on a confused mess. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>156. ""Virus"" - 'Best of the Beast' (1996)</b><br>
As if ‘The X-Factor’ wasn’t grim and harrowing enough, the stand-alone single that followed it took Maiden into even more hopeless, anguished territory. Blaze Bayley does his best to keep the whole thing cracking along, but it’s essentially a monochrome dirge with no real tune. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>155. ""No Prayer for the Dying"" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)</b><br>
Easily the weakest album the band have made with Bruce on board, ‘No Prayer For The Dying’ was sold to fans as a ‘back-to-basics’ affair. The reality was that much of it sounded unimaginative and half-baked. The title track, while eminently likable, is almost certainly not on your Maiden Spotify playlist. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>154. ""Don't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger"" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)</b><br>
Needlessly drawn out and powered by some rather pedestrian riffs that surely wouldn’t have made the grade on earlier Maiden albums, “Don’t Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger” stumbles on its own complexity and has an ending that doesn’t work. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>153. ""Roll Over Vic Vella"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
A semi-cover of Chuck Berry’s “Roll Over Beethoven” with new lyrics about the band’s roadie, Vic Vella. Chuck Berry covers, unsurprisingly, aren’t Iron Maiden’s strong suit. On the other hand, it’s better than Judas Priest’s “Johnny B. Goode.” (BI)<br>
<br>
<b>152. ""Hooks in You"" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)</b><br>
Adrian Smith has written so many songs that are vastly better than “Hooks In You” that it seems a bit pointless to mention it at all. But we must, if only to celebrate the phrase “New ideas for the décor tonight!” Never thought we’d hear Bruce sing that, to be fair. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>151. ""Wasting Love"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
A well-intended but unsatisfying ballad on ‘Fear Of The Dark,’ an album that had plenty of much more exciting moments, “Wasting Love” is both an overlong showcase for Bruce Dickinson’s voice and a good excuse to go and make some tea. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>150. ""The Educated Fool"" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)</b><br>
Stymied by its anaemic production and a palpable lack of killer material, ‘Virtual XI’ isn’t without its merits and “The Educated Fool” boasts at least one great melody to justify its inclusion. Compared to “The Clansman,” however, it’s not up to scratch. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>149. ""Tears of a Clown"" - 'The Book of Souls (2015)</b><br>
Briefly played during Maiden’s ‘Book Of Souls’ live campaign, this self-explanatory salute to troubled funny men is yet another great example of Adrian Smith’s subtly subversive contributions to the Maiden sound. But a Smokey Robinson cover would have been much funnier, if we’re honest. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>148. ""El Dorado"" - 'The Final Frontier' (2010)</b><br>
It starts with what sounds like an ending: a typically contrary Maiden move, let’s face it. “El Dorado” is not one of the band’s greatest singles, but it did win a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 2011. So hooray for that. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>147. ""Out of the Shadows"" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)</b><br>
Brimming with moments of unashamed prog abandon, this oddity gave ‘A Matter Of Life And Death’ one of its rare moments of emotional respite, albeit mainly because Steve Harris’ bass-line is so goddamn hypnotic. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>146. ""Fortunes of War"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
After a relatively exciting opening triumvirate of new songs, ‘The X-Factor’ slows down for “Fortunes Of War” and loses practically all of its momentum. The lyrics are brooding and full of quiet rage, but the music beneath them is not among Maiden’s finest five minutes. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>145. ""The Aftermath"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
The lumbering nadir of ‘The X-Factor,’ “The Aftermath” arrives after “Fortunes Of War” and “Look For The Truth” have already drained your lifesblood. The longest, darkest and least memorable of the three, it does at least hammer home the point that Steve Harris was in a terrible mood. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>144. ""Mother Russia"" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)</b><br>
By 1990, Maiden fans were used to the band’s albums containing a grandiose epic or two. But after the glories of “Rime Of The Ancient Mariner” and “Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son,” “Mother Russia” was a slight anti-climax. You can bet Dimmu Borgir liked it, though. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>143. ""Childhood's End"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
There are more than a few unsung gems lurking on Maiden’s less celebrated albums, and the skewed goth-prog splendour of “Childhood’s End” is firmly among them. By no means a classic, it does give ‘Fear Of The Dark’ a rare moment of forward-thinking oomph. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>142. ""Look for the Truth"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
The big downfall of ‘The X-Factor’ is the prolonged period of slow, miserable songs halfway through. “Look For The Truth” is particularly weak, with predictable chord changes serving only to hammer home the lack of a genuinely punchy melody. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>141. ""Listen With Nicko, Part XI"" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)</b><br>
Nicko McBrain: he’s just ahead of his time. He was a podcaster decades before podcasts (or even iPods). On 1990’s ‘The First Ten Years’ box set, he recorded a bunch of monologues as bonus tracks. They were so popular (or, at least, someone told Nicko that they were), that he recorded another one as a bonus track for ‘No Prayer For The Dying.’ Note to Nicko: the world needs to know about your comedic brilliance. Seriously, please start a podcast. (BI)<br>
<br>
<b>140. ""Age of Innocence"" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)</b><br>
""Age of Innocence"" finds Iron Maiden returning to the well of film and literature to vent their frustrations with the world and its rocky systems of government. The vitriol here is fairly shallow though, echoing the same tired sentiments of countless citizens of the world and while, yes, its certainly angsty with some aggressive riffing, it's not very inspired. (JD)<br>
<br>
<b>139. ""The Man Who Would Be King"" - 'The Final Frontier' (2010)</b><br>
With Dave Murray’s ultra-melodic instincts all over it, the penultimate epic from ‘The Final Frontier’ veers from swooshing keys and a disembodied Bruce floating in the haze to long stretches of full-on Maiden bombast, replete with what sound like post-In Flames harmonies. That’s a joke for our older readers, by the way. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>138. ""For the Greater Good of God"" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)</b><br>
Steve Harris loves a good epic. He also loves a heart-wrenching war story. This nine-minute sprawl from ‘A Matter Of Life And Death’ combines the two to chilling and faintly morose effect. Resurrected for the current “Legacy Of The Beast” tour, it’s not a party banger. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>137. ""2 A.M."" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
One slow, sad song too many for most fans, when they reached the end of Maiden’s most emotionally gruelling album, “2 A.M.” works best in isolation. A pretty but spiky ballad, beautifully sung by Blaze, it’s a straightforward outpouring of melancholy and angst. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>136. ""Mission From 'Arry"" - ""2 Minutes to Midnight"" Single (1984)</b><br>
Although Bruce Dickinson doesn’t appear on this recording, we have him to thank for it. “Mission From ‘Arry” is a recording of a pretty intense (but funny) argument between Steve Harris (a.k.a. “‘Arry”) and Nicko McBrain that Bruce was kind enough to record for the rest of us; it reached the public as a b-side to “2 Minutes To Midnight.” Apparently, during a gig, Steve Harris’ bass gear broke down, and he sent a roadie to tell McBrain to extend his drum solo while they were fixing it. The moral of the story is: don’t interrupt a drummer DURING the solo. But if you do, be sure to record the ensuing brawl. (BI)<br>
<br>
<b>135. ""The Pilgrim"" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)</b><br>
Arguably the runt of the ‘A Matter Of Life And Death’ litter, “The Pilgrim” is an essential part of the album but not a song you’re likely to whistle in the shower. Fast-paced and edgy, it’s every bit as progressive as the songs around it, but lacks one truly heart-stopping moment. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>134. ""Dance of Death"" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)</b><br>
Lauded and loathed in equal measure for being a little bit too close to Spinal Tap’s “Stonehenge” routine for comfort, “Dance Of Death” wears its prog rock influences with pride and really doesn’t care if you like songs about wizards or not. So there. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>133. ""Déjà Vu"" - 'Somewhere in Time' (1986)</b><br>
One of the fastest tracks on ‘Somewhere In Time,’ “Déjà vu” is much loved by Maiden fans of a certain age, partly because it’s a rare Dave Murray/Steve Harris co-write (we nerds love this shit) and partly because the twin-lead moments are spectacular. The lyrics are a bit daft, however. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>132. ""Chains of Misery"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
Uncomfortably close to the kind of one-dimensional metal that Maiden had always avoided, “Chains Of Misery” is unusual for the band’s decision to use gang vocals in the chorus. Worth a try, perhaps, but it doesn’t really work. This is more filler than killer. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>131. ""Judgement of Heaven"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
A song that just about saves ‘The X-Factor’ from falling asleep at the wheel, “Judgement Of Heaven” has a killer chorus that is sadly not quite matched by the rest of the tune. A great vocal from Blaze Bayley, however, and a wistfully quasi-spiritual lyric thrown in for free. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>130. ""When the Rivers Runs Deep"" - 'The Book of Souls (2015)</b><br>
A strong candidate for the weakest track on ‘The Book Of Souls,’ “When The River Runs Deep” just about earns its place on Maiden’s latest album thanks to a brilliantly off-the-wall Adrian Smith solo four minutes in. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>129. ""Sheriff of Huddersfield"" - 'Somewhere in Time' (1986)</b><br>
Maiden’s best B-sides have generally been spirited covers or, very occasionally, the sound of grown men dicking about. A tribute to manager Rod Smallwood that pulls no punches about the great man’s reported miserliness, it’s actually a half-decent song (with stupid lyrics). (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>128. ""The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg"" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)</b><br>
The first song to be released from ‘A Matter Of Life And Death,’ this dark, heavy and seemingly unlikely single arrived tied to some vague promotional scheme involving a the mysterious identity of the song’s titular hero. No, we don’t know how that worked out either. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>127. ""Journeyman"" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)</b><br>
Maiden’s much-vaunted leap into acoustic territory was one of Dance Of Death’s most memorable moments. With a vague hint of Jethro Tull and a large dollop of world-weary resignation, “Journeyman” worked pretty well live, too. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>126. ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" - 'Somewhere in Time' (1986)</b><br>
Another Steve Harris composition reportedly inspired by his voracious movie-watching habits, this rapacious epic may pale beside the better songs on ‘Somewhere In Time,’ but it’s still a riot of spiralling leads and lithe, rhythmic wallop. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>125. ""Lord of the Flies"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
It’s never been that hard to keep track of Steve Harris’ reading and watching habits. This song’s thematic debt to William Golding’s legendary novel was fully in keeping with the dark aesthetic of ‘The X-Factor,’ but Maiden have seldom sounded less chirpy. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>124. ""Holy Smoke"" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)</b><br>
Belatedly addressing the TV preacher phenomenon with no great subtlety, “Holy Smoke” is not one of Maiden’s best singles, but it is notable for boasting (a) a rare sighting of a curse word in a Maiden song (Bruce says ‘shit!’) and (b) one of the best/worst videos ever made. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>123. ""Satellite 15... The Final Frontier"" - 'The Final Frontier' (2010)</b><br>
Opinion was split on the values of “Satellite 15,” a noisy futuristic intro with jarring programmed drums, and it still sounds like what it was (an Adrian Smith demo), but “The Final Frontier” is a nuts-out, sky-punching Maiden anthem, so it’s not all bad news. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>122. ""Justice of the Peace"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
A Murray/Harris co-write confined to the b-side on the second of two CD single versions of “Man On The Edge” (it was a confusing time to be alive, folks), this fair-to-middling rabble-rouser is arguably more exciting than a good third of ‘The X-Factor.’ Just saying. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>121. ""Fates Warning"" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)</b><br>
Literally no one’s favourite Maiden song, “Fates Warning” was probably not named after the iconic progressive metal band, not least because it lacks a single interesting musical idea. A major low point in the first Bruce era, you just can’t whistle it in the shower, can you? (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>120. ""The Mercenary"" - 'Brave New World' (2000)</b><br>
On an album full of joyful demonstrations of their renewed prowess, Iron Maiden could probably have left “The Mercenary” off ‘Brave New World,’ simply because it’s the kind of song you suspect they can write in their collective sleep. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>119. ""The Unbeliever"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
Tucked at the back-end of somewhat overlong ‘The X-Factor,’ “The Unbeliever” may be a song that many fans never quite got round to listening to. But they should: it’s a scowling, nihilistic affair with some neat proggy touches. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>118. ""Death or Glory"" - 'The Book of Souls (2015)</b><br>
Custom built for live performance, “Death Or Glory” saw Adrian Smith reasserting himself as master of brevity and bombast. Bruce Dickinson’s instruction to “climb like a monkey” never made a great deal of sense, but this is heavy metal, not chemistry. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>117. ""Afraid to Shoot Strangers"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
Perhaps against the odds, this rambling epic has made occasional visits to Maiden’s set lists over the last 25 years. It’s a tense and turbulent war story, the horrors of the Gulf War brought eloquently to life by Steve Harris. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>116. ""Invaders"" - 'The Number of the Beast' (1982)</b><br>
Few would argue that “Invaders” is a classic like “Run To The Hills” or “The Number Of The Beast,” but it’s hard to imagine Maiden’s triumphant 1982 breakthrough album without this mad-eyed, riff-driven ambush as its starting point.<br>
<br>
<b>115. ""New Frontier"" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)</b><br>
Three decades after joining Iron Maiden, Nicko McBrain earned his first writing credit on the ‘Frankenstein’-inspired “New Frontier.” The track’s kicking energy and single-leaning approach is the last bit of joy to be found as darkness looms large over the ensuing four tracks that close out the ‘Dance of Death’ record. Despite its charm, it doesn’t have as much staying power on the dynamic recording, but it’s always a fun one when it pops up either on shuffle or when cruising through ‘Dance of Death.’ (JD)<br>
<br>
<b>114. ""Man on the Edge"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
The first Blaze Bayley-fronted Maiden song to be released, “Man On The Edge” came as a great relief to many diehards. Spiky and aggressive, its re-imagining of Michael Douglas’ peerless film ‘Falling Down’ gave ‘The X-Factor’ some much needed energy. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>113. ""From Here to Eternity"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
A disappointingly prosaic rock and roller from the intermittently great ‘Fear Of The Dark,’ this mostly unloved single always seemed a bit unimaginative, especially since only four years had passed since ‘Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son.’ (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>112. ""These Colours Don't Run"" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)</b><br>
Sharon Osbourne may deserve a songwriting credit on “These Colours Don’t Run,” since the track wouldn’t exist without her egging of Iron Maiden at Ozzfest 2005. Named after the sentiment Bruce Dickinson aired onstage, “These Colours Don’t Run” is another solid wartime effort from Maiden worthy of its seven minute run time. (GH)<br>
<br>
<b>111. ""The Edge of Darkness"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
One of several moody, predominantly slow-paced epics that Steve Harris wrote to showcase Blaze Bayley’s powerful, gritty voice, this was a highlight of the underrated second half of ‘The X-Factor,’ albeit not one you’d necessarily play at a party. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>110. ""Wildest Dreams"" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)</b><br>
Maiden went through a period where every new album seemed to be preceded by a short, snappy three-to-four-minute sing-along single. “Wildest Dreams” isn’t one of the band’s best but it served its purpose perfectly well as a set opener on the ‘Dance Of Death’ tour. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>109. ""Invasion"" - 'The Soundhouse Tapes' (1979)</b><br>
Blustery and naïve it may be, but “Invasion” is an exciting snapshot of early Maiden, when harnessing the energy of punk at least seemed to be part of the band’s modus operandi. Revered for its presence on ‘The Soundhouse Tapes’ alone, it’s basically impossible to dislike. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>108. ""The Fallen Angel"" - 'Brave New World' (2000)</b><br>
There’s nothing wrong with ‘The Fallen Angel.” It’s a sturdy Maiden anthem with some great riffs and a huge chorus. It’s just nowhere near as life-affirming as “The Wicker Man” or other classics from ‘Brave New World.’ So there’s that. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>107. ""The Assassin"" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)</b><br>
One of the most adventurous and distinctive songs on ‘No Prayer For The Dying,’ “The Assassin” was a little out of place on an otherwise disappointingly straightforward album. Worth a second glance, it offers faint clues to Maiden’s eventual rebirth as prog metal overlords. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>106. ""Gates of Tomorrow"" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)</b><br>
A decent showcase for the occasional Harris/Dickinson/Gers team-up, “Gates Of Tomorrow” is a no-nonsense stormer that was perhaps too firmly rooted in trad Maiden territory to stand out amid the gently eclectic menu offered up by ‘Dance Of Death.’ (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>105. ""The Man of Sorrows"" - 'The Book of Souls (2015)</b><br>
All glory to Mr. Dave Murray on this one. The guitarist’s legato technique is flawless and unparalleled as notes elegantly blossom from his smooth, overtly-melodic delivery. He sets the mood on “The Man of Sorrows” (not to be confused with Bruce’s ‘Accident of Birth’ solo track, “Man of Sorrows”), with his fluttering lead work and the song quickly takes on a theme of hope enveloped in uncertainty with striding rhythms, bombastic synths and melancholic melodies. (JD)<br>
<br>
<b>104. ""Face in the Sand"" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)</b><br>
‘Dance Of Death’ was a strange combination of classic Maidenisms and unexpected left-turns. “Face In The Sand” takes an age to get going, but its Floyd-esque slow-build suits the darker intent of mature Maiden perfectly. Extra points for Nicko’s thudding double-kicks. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>103. ""The Fugitive"" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)</b><br>
A song that promises much but delivers slightly less, “The Fugitive” is a classic Steve Harris anthem: straight-ahead riffs and linear lyrics, with a bonus detour into moderately proggy territory for the song’s actually rather brilliant instrumental mid-section. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>102. ""When Two Worlds Collide"" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)</b><br>
Contrary to received wisdom, there are lots of cool moments on ‘Virtual XI’ and the spooky intro to “When Two Worlds Collide” is one of them. Unfortunately, the song then lumbers when it should soar, its relatively lively chorus and neat harmonies somehow lacking that essential Maiden spark. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>101. ""Different World"" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)</b><br>
Unashamedly saluting the melodic power of Thin Lizzy, the opening track on ‘A Matter Of Life And Death’ is a straightforwardly incisive exercise in hard rock songwriting and strong evidence that Bruce Dickinson should sing in a lower register more often. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>100. ""Mother of Mercy"" - 'The Final Frontier' (2010)</b><br>
Reaffirming Bruce Dickinson’s ability to hit notes that only dogs can hear, “Mother Of Mercy” is not an obvious highlight of ‘The Final Frontier,’ but it boasts a performance from Bruce that will cheerfully take the paint from your walls. The closing riff is enjoyably gnarly, too. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>99. ""Blood on the World's Hands"" - 'The X Factor' (1995)</b><br>
‘The X-Factor’ is an album of shadowy terrors and slow-motion menace, but it also has its fair share of quirky moments. “Blood On The World’s Hands” starts with one of Steve Harris’ trademark, rough-hewn bass solos and then transforms into a grinding, epic anti-ballad. (DL)<br>
<br>
<b>98. ""The Nomad"" - 'Brave New World' (2000)</b><br>
One of several Maiden songs to transport us all to a vast, bleak and sun-ravaged desert, “The Nomad” gave ‘Brave New World’ its most sumptuously epic moment. A tribute to “The rider of the desert sands,” its opulent sprawl deftly matches the subject matter, scorched grain for grain. (DL)</p>

Papá Dios me ayuda sin tener que madrugar<br>

To' el que está puesto pa' hacer dinero<br>

Que sigan pasándola cabrón<br>

Los quiero, gente, con cojone', los amo, puñeta</p>

"<p>[Letra de ""GRACIAS POR NADA""]<br>
<br>
[Intro]<br>
Ey, no sé si cachaste lo que te quise decir<br>
Es que tú ere' masoquista, te lo vuelvo a repetir, ey<br>
Aunque me llame tu mai, aunque aparezca tu pai<br>
Aunque baje Jesucristo y nos vuelva a bendecir<br>
Lo nuestro no lo vuelvo a revivir, no lo vuelvo a revivir<br>
Solo me resta decirte (Ey, ey)<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Gracias por nada, gracias por nada<br>
Ya no hay pa' ti ni bicho ni Prada<br>
Ya yo te caché, ma, te vas pichada<br>
Recoge tus cosa' y no dejes nada (No)<br>
Gracias por nada, gracias por nada<br>
Ya no hay pa' ti ni bicho ni Prada (No)<br>
Yo sé lo que hiciste, una hijеputada<br>
Tú vete tranquila, no me dеbe' nada<br>
<br>
[Verso]<br>
Porque to' lo que te di fue de corazón<br>
Si te veo de nuevo es por el retrovisor<br>
Si tú me ves de nuevo, es por el televisor<br>
Una peli de amor que no existió, porque<br>
Yo pensaba que tú era' Julieta y yo era tu Romeo<br>
Pero vi que estaba erróneo<br>
Tú me tenía' dormido y con insomnio (Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)<br>
Pero a media noche desperté y te pillé to' los texts<br>
Tú con él, yo pichándole a toa'<br>
Mírame a los ojo', no me bajes la cabeza<br>
No estás siendo sincera y eso es lo que me pesa<br>
Tú enrolaste y te fumaste las promesa'<br>
Tú estás buena, pero eso no es belleza<br>
Bonito es que siempre digan la verdad<br>
Yo no 'toy pa' esto y meno' a esta edad, ey<br>
Los días malo' no se cansan, je<br>
Aborrecío', estoy que me mudo pa' Kansa'<br>
Si ponemo' nuestros errore' en la balanza<br>
Yo fallé más que tú, pero en darte mi confianza<br>
Ey, ey<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Gracias por nada, gracias por nada<br>
Ya no hay pa' ti ni bicho ni Prada<br>
Ya yo te caché, ma, te vas pichada<br>
Recoge tus cosa' y no dejes nada<br>
Gracias por nada, gracias por nada<br>
Ya no hay pa' ti ni bicho ni Prada<br>
Yo sé lo que hiciste, una hijeputada<br>
Tú vete tranquila, no me debes nada</p>

[Приспів: Coi Leray]<br>
О Боже, вона далеко від передмістя<br>
Приїхала в місто за коханням, а тепер їй боляче<br>
О Боже, вона далеко від передмістя<br>
Далеко, дуже далеко від передмістя<br>
<br>
[Куплет 1: Coi Leray]<br>
Кохання у маленькому місті, закоханість, не лікується<br>
Занадто багато п'ю, занадто багато думаю, тону в думках<br>
Я під кайфом, будь ласка, не плач, не сумнівайся в мені<br>
Ти не знаєш, що таке кохання, ти лише показуєш його, перестань мене розчаровувати<br>
<br>
[Перед приспів: Coi Leray]<br>
Самолюб, він не любить себе, він намагається любити мене<br>
Арештуй мене, скажи йому правду, він мені не довіряє<br>
Самолюб, він не любить себе, намагається любити мене<br>

[Приспів: Coi Leray]<br>
О Боже, вона далеко від передмістя<br>
Приїхала в місто за коханням, а тепер їй боляче<br>
Ох, як далеко вона від передмістя<br>
Далеко, дуже далеко від передмістя<br>
<br>
[Куплет 2: Coi Leray]<br>
Великі мрії (Йоу), так, великі крики, так (Ох, є)<br>
Вона вразлива<br>
Ненавидить бачити, так (Воу), грошові схеми, так (Воу)<br>
Життя сумнівне<br>
Мої друзі їздять (Йоу) на нових бумерах (Ох, є)<br>
Кабріолети з відкидним верхом<br>
Любиш тусуватися, а тепер кажеш, що ненавидиш<br>
Відчуваю себе інтровертом<br>
<br>
[Перед приспів: Coi Leray]<br>
Самолюб, він не любить себе, він намагається любити мене<br>
Арештуй мене, скажи йому правду, він мені не довіряє<br>

Що ж, усе буває вперше, чи не так?</p>

Lucky for me, no, he never caught us, oh<br>

Rubbin' two nickels just tryin' to make a dime<br>

Drop her down to four-wheel drive on a Friday night<br>
Crackin' open a cold Bud Light<br>
Oh, we ride<br>
Pushin' through the hard love, lookin' for my give-a-fuck<br>
Needle peggin' ninety-five, but that's alright<br>

<br>
DISCOURSE ON EDUCATION,<br>
<br>
DELIVERED AT THEIR REQUEST BEFORE THEM,<br>

<br>
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DISCOURSE.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The celebrated Historian of England, David Hume,<br>
in the account of his life written in the 65th year of his<br>
age by himself, says, '' I am, or rather was (for that is the<br>
style I must now use in speaking of myself, which em-<br>
boldens me the more to speak my sentiments) ; I tvas, I<br>
say, a man of mild disposition,"" &amp;c. then giving his own<br>
character, according to his own estimate of it.<br>
<br>
Men and women of Braintree ! I have lived eight years<br>
longer in this world of vicissitudes and cares, than David<br>
Hume had lived when he felt himself bound to assume<br>
this style, and when he considered it as investing him<br>
with the privilege of speaking more boldly his sentiments,<br>
than he might have done while speaking in the present<br>
tense.<br>
<br>
Am I not then authorised by his example, to invert the<br>
order of his transition from the present to the past, and to<br>
say — I was or rather I am one of yourselves ? I was born<br>
at Braintree ; and in the revolution of time, I am, one of<br>
the oldest inhabitants of that Town. In Braintree I first<br>
beheld the light of Heaven — first breathed the atmosphere<br>
of your granite rocks — first sucked with my mother's<br>
milk the love of Liberty, and the reverence for the Gospel<br>
of truth. In early childhood, in the midst of the storm<br>
of the war of Independence, in the dead of Winter, I<br>
embarked at the very spot where your forefathers landed<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
at the foot of Mount Wollaston — I embarked, with a<br>
father, upon the tempestuous ocean, for realms beyond the<br>
Atlantic tide ; defying the battle and the breeze for the<br>
cause of your Country. Since then, for a space of forty<br>
years I led a wandering life, in distant regions ; always in<br>
the service of your fathers or in yours ; always grateful to<br>
Heaven for having made me a Braintree boy, and always<br>
feeling the sentiments, which once on losing sight of the<br>
blue hills in your neighborhood, I committed to paper in<br>
the following lines :<br>
<br>
And you, ye distant hills of blue —<br>
<br>
To whom I bid, with bosom burning,<br>
When wending far, my last Adieu ;<br>
<br>
And first to greet mine eyes returning;<br>
Oh ! how shall speech in words convey,<br>
<br>
Words, the heart holds not in derision,<br>
The pang that points your parting ray.<br>
<br>
The bliss that wings your meeting vision.<br>
<br>
Let me then in addressing you, fellow citizens of Brain-<br>
tree, say I ivas or rather I am a native of the town of<br>
Braintree, and let that be your motive for indulging me<br>
with the freedom of speech — with more boldness than I<br>
might presume to use, if I came among you as a stranger.<br>
<br>
And I make this appeal to your kind and indulgent<br>
feelings because I shall need it. David Hume took it as a<br>
warrant of authority to speak his sentiments boldly,<br>
because at the age of 65 he claimed to be a man of a<br>
former age ; restrained by none of those prudential consid-<br>
erations which admonish a speaker in addressing the public<br>
to abstain from exciting topics, and to say nothing with<br>
which the prepossessions of his hearers might not cordially<br>
sympathise — Yet he had not then attained, and never<br>
reached the allotted boundary of old age to man — the<br>
three score years and ten of his earthly pilgrimage ; which<br>
I have already passed. I have then a stronger claim than<br>
his upon the mere score of age to speak my sentiments<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
boldly, and that which is thus my right, becomes my im-<br>
perious and overrnling duty, towards you the inhabitants<br>
of my native town, of which through all the wanderings<br>
of a long and eventful life, I have never ceased in the<br>
sincerity of my soul to say,<br>
<br>
"" Where'er I roam, whatever realms I see,<br>
My heart untravell'd fondly turns to thee.""<br>
<br>
When I undertook the arduous, but not unwelcome task<br>
of addressing you in public, it was intimated to me that it<br>
might be agreeable to yon to hear me upon that most in-<br>
teresting subject to you and to your posterity, the educa-<br>
tion of your children ; and the desire of discoursing to you<br>
upon the theme, not less than in the manner the most<br>
acceptable to yourselves, was of strong prevailment to in-<br>
duce a ready compliance with that intimation.<br>
<br>
But what could I possibly say to you for the advance-<br>
ment of the cause of education which you do not habit-<br>
ually say to yourselves ? — We are almost daily celebrating<br>
in every part of New England, the accomplishment of two<br>
centuries since the first gathering of a church or the<br>
incorporation of a town. A few weeks only have past<br>
away since the filial reverence of the descendants from the<br>
first founders of the church and religious society at Mount<br>
Wollaston, paid this tribute of commemoration to the<br>
virtues of their forefathers — and within the compass of<br>
another year it is your purpose to strew flowers over the<br>
sepulchres of those patriarchs of our land by a similar<br>
festival to keep in remembrance the founders of our prim-<br>
itive town of Braintree. We have embalmed anew the<br>
venerable remains of our first Pastor and Teacher William<br>
Thomson and Henry Flint ; but there is an incident con-<br>
nected with the history of the latter, not less precious<br>
than any other memorial in his individual life. On his<br>
grave stone, yet standing in the cemetery of the church in<br>
Q,uincy, of which he was a principal founder, is yet legible<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8<br>
<br>
the following record — "" Here lies interred the body of the<br>
Rev. Mr. Henry Flint, who came to New England in the<br>
year 1635, was ordained the first teacher of the church of<br>
Braintray 1639, and died April 27, 1668. He had the<br>
character of a gentleman, remarkable for his piety, learning,<br>
wisdom and fidelity in his ofiice."" Men and women of<br>
Braintree ! had the monumental inscription upon the tomb<br>
of the beloved instructor and spiritual monitor, counseller<br>
and guide, of your forefather pilgrims of the first cis-<br>
atlantic generation terminated here, might I not have<br>
invited you to pause and meditate — ^to inquire how much<br>
of the peace, how much of the earthly happiness, how<br>
much of the piety and virtue, how much of the eternal<br>
welfare of your ancestors of five generations, of yourselves,<br>
of your children and your children's children to the end<br>
of time, may be directly and indirectly traced to those<br>
qualities thus testified as characteristics of this venerable<br>
man ? — But the blessed memorial stops not here, it proceeds<br>
— "" By him on his right hand lies the body of Margery,<br>
his beloved consort who died March 1686-7. Her maid-<br>
en name was Hoar. She was a gentlewoman of piety,<br>
prudence, and peculiarly accomplished for instructing young<br>
gentlewomen, many being sent to her from other towns,<br>
especially from Boston."" Women of Braintree, let me<br>
now appeal to you ! If I was authorised to inquire how<br>
highly is to be estimated by your townsmen of the present<br>
generation, the blessing of being descended from fathers<br>
who were fed with the nourishment of the bread of life<br>
by a shepherd of souls so distinguished as the first teacher<br>
of the Braintree Church, how much more emphatically<br>
may I ask the same question of you, who in addition to<br>
the enjoyment of the same benefits, may look back to<br>
the matrons of the town from its first foundation, as blest<br>
with the means of education suited to the tenderness, the<br>
refinement and delicacy of their sex. The solicitude of<br>
the first fathers of New England for the education of<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
9<br>
<br>
their sons has been among their brightest claims to renown<br>
in all succeeding ages. And shall it not be among the<br>
garlands of glory to the women of Braintree, that in the<br>
roll of their primitive mothers, the wife of their first<br>
pastor was not only eminent as an instructress of wisdom<br>
and virtue, but that her services to the age and land in<br>
which she lived, were so worthily appreciated by her<br>
surviving cotemporary inhabitants of the town, that their<br>
grateful acknowledgment and remembrance of them yet<br>
lives and breathes and speaks to us all, from the assembled<br>
multitude of the surrounding dead, and from the voice of<br>
her husband's tomb.<br>
<br>
— It is an opinion universally entertained that the first<br>
and great impulse to the settlement of New England was<br>
Religion. But has it been sufficiently considered, and<br>
may I be permitted to inquire, whether Religion is not<br>
herself the child of Education, and whether it would not<br>
be more proper to say, that Education was from its first<br>
origin the governing principle of the settlement of New<br>
England, or in other words that Education was the mother<br>
of New England ?<br>
<br>
What is Religion 1 Is it not the sentiment in the heart<br>
of man, of his own immortal nature, and of his responsi-<br>
bility to a tribunal not of earth for his conduct upon earth.<br>
The existence of a God ; the immortality of the human<br>
soul, and future retribution, are the elements of what is<br>
called Natural Religion — but even these first principles are<br>
not of spontaneous growth in the human heart. They<br>
are the fruits of Education — they must be taught. They<br>
were revealed by God himself to the first created man,<br>
and to his' partner in the Garden of Eden, and they are<br>
still taught to Christians of all denominations in the Mo-<br>
saic narrative of the Creation.<br>
<br>
But this is not the Religion which prompted the settle-<br>
ment of New England — for this is a creed common to<br>
the Christian, Mohammedan and Jew throughout the habi-<br>
2<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
10<br>
<br>
table globe. The first settlers of New England were<br>
Christians of the most straitest sect. Their text-book<br>
was the Bible ; a book written by various authors — in<br>
different periods of the world — the latest, sixteen hundred<br>
years remote, at the time of the settlement of New Eng-<br>
land, and all, in languages no longer extant save in the<br>
memory of the profoundly learned.<br>
<br>
In this book were contained the history of the human<br>
race from the creation of the world ; a rule of faith, for the<br>
relations between man and his Maker ; a rule of life, for<br>
the government of his relations with his fellow creature<br>
man — and the glorious gospel of the blessed God. But<br>
in the wise and inscrutable dispensations of Providence,<br>
this book of divine inspiration for its composition, had<br>
been committed to the uninspired intellect of man for its<br>
construction. What the meaning was of any one state-<br>
ment of fact, principle, sentiment or opinion contained in<br>
it, was to be ascertained by the ordinary operations of the<br>
human mind. It was mind impressed upon paper, in the<br>
characters of the alphabet. But the first five books of<br>
this compilation, the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses,<br>
had been written very recently after the first invention of<br>
alphabetical writing, and contained in that mode of<br>
incorporating thought two thousand years of history<br>
before the existence of that invention ; when the narra-<br>
tive of events, and the lessons of morals, and the precepts<br>
of instruction must necessarily have been delivered from<br>
mind to mind, by some other mode of conveyance. It is<br>
well known that before the invention of alphabetical<br>
writing, the Egyptian records were kept in what was<br>
called hieroglyphics, or an art of expressing thought by<br>
imagery. Writing was the picture of thought. Material<br>
substances were thus represented by their portraiture, a<br>
man, a horse, a bird, a fish. The sun, moon and stars,<br>
mountains, trees and rivers, every object in nature visible<br>
to the eye, could be represented to the eye, by imitation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11<br>
<br>
In the progress of human improvement certain properties<br>
were observed invariably to belong to certain material sub-<br>
stances, and by common agreement the material substance<br>
was exhibited for the property belonging to it. Hence the<br>
extension of the art of hieroglyphic writing, and I submit<br>
to your consideration a conjecture which has often occurred<br>
to me, that the account of the creation in the book of Gen-<br>
esis, was only a transfer to alphabetic writing, of more an-<br>
cient Egyptian memorials in hieroglyphics. For we are<br>
expressly told that Moses was learned in all the wisdom of<br>
the Egyptians, and this may account for the representa-<br>
tion of the Spirit of evil in the form of a Serpent, and for<br>
that of life, and for the knowledge of good and evil,<br>
abstractions of the mind, in the shape of trees growing in<br>
the garden of Paradise.<br>
<br>
Be this however as it may, the books of Moses are<br>
written in the Hebrew language, a dialect of the Phoeni-<br>
cian ; as it was spoken by the children of Israel at the<br>
time of their emigration from Egypt about fifteen hundred<br>
years before the birth of Christ. The subsequent histori-<br>
cal books, from Joshua, the immediate successor of Moses,<br>
to Ezra and Nehemiah, contain the history of more than<br>
one thousand years, in the same language, modified from<br>
age to age, through the long lapse of years, and by the<br>
intermixture of the children of Israel with the various<br>
nations of Palestine, and with the Assyrians, Babylonians,<br>
Modes and Persians, by whom they were successively<br>
subdued and carried into captivity. The Psalms of David,<br>
as they are called, but really of him and of several other<br>
writers ranging through a period of a thousand years, the<br>
Proverbs, the Canticles, and the Ecclesiastes of Solomon,<br>
and the solemn and awful revelations from Heaven com-<br>
mitted to writing by seventeen prophets, are in the same<br>
language, with an intermixture of the Chaldaic in the<br>
books composed after the Babylonian captivity. All the<br>
Books of tlie New Testament, as originally composed, are<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
12<br>
<br>
in the Greek language, and there are translations of all the<br>
Books of the Old Testament into the Greek and Latin<br>
languages, of so great antiquity, that by the vast majority<br>
of the Christian world they are considered in all respects<br>
of equal, and in some passages of superior authority to the<br>
Hebrew.<br>
<br>
These books, thus composed, are universally admitted,<br>
by all Christians of all denominations, as containing a rule<br>
of faith and a rule of life for all human kind. But, con-<br>
sidered merely as history, they relate a series of events<br>
almost entirely miraculous, that is of special interpositions<br>
of divine Providence, suspending the ordinary laws of<br>
physical nature, and operating by preternatural agency.<br>
Considered as prophecies, their predictions are darkly and<br>
mysteriously blended with their history — and there is<br>
among Christians great diversity of opinion, with regard<br>
to the import and meaning of the prophecies — diversities<br>
which have given rise to bitter controversies, to furious<br>
dissensions, and to cruel, bloody and exterminating wars.<br>
<br>
The Founder of the Christian religion himself, promised<br>
as a Redeemer of mankind from the transgression of their<br>
first parents in paradise — promised by a covenant of Al-<br>
mighty God with Abraham the father of the faithful, in<br>
the clear, explicit and repeated declaration that in his seed<br>
all the families of the earth should be blessed — promised<br>
again to his son Isaac, and to his son Jacob — promised<br>
through a long succession of ages, to Moses, to Daniel, to<br>
Solomon, to a long line of prophets and of kings — the Foun-<br>
der of the Christian religion himself, was crucified as a<br>
malefactor — numbered with the transgressors of that very<br>
law which he came to fulfil and to abolish. He suffered<br>
the ignominious death of the Cross, by the sentence of the<br>
law, delivered from Sinai, as understood and expounded<br>
by the high priest instituted by that divine dispensation.<br>
<br>
But this crucified Galilean, was the Saviour of the<br>
world — the Redeemer promised at the expulsion of<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
13<br>
<br>
Adam from Paradise. In a career of four years of man-<br>
hood immediately preceding his death, he had unfolded<br>
to the world of mankind a new i^ule of life — a com-<br>
plete system of morals, founded upon two first principles ;<br>
two elementary ideas. The one, was life and immor-<br>
tality, or in other words, the resurrection. The other,<br>
was the law of brotherly love, founded upon the principle<br>
of the natural equality of mankind and the resulting prin-<br>
ciple of peace on earth, good will to men, and the duty<br>
of universal application of doing unto others as you would<br>
that they should do unto you. In these two elementary<br>
principles, all Christians of all denominations concur.<br>
Whoever derides or disbelieves them or either of them can<br>
have no claims to the title of a Christian. It was not<br>
indeed for the promulgation of either of these doctrines<br>
that he suffered death. It was for the assertion of his<br>
own authority as the promised Messiah, for the declaration<br>
that he was the Son of God — that he possessed and ex-<br>
ercised the power of performing miracles, and of forgiving<br>
sins ; and for the unqualified assertion, that if they should<br>
put him to death he would by his own resurrection and<br>
ascension within three days, prove the truth of his doc-<br>
trine of immortal life. He was accordingly sentenced to<br>
death, and the sentence was executed in strict conformity<br>
to the Law of Moses as it was understood by the Priests,<br>
the Scribes and Pharisees, the Ministers and Interpreters<br>
of the Law, And as he had foretold, on the third day<br>
from his crucifixion he rose again from the dead, was<br>
seen and conversed with by hundreds of his disciples for<br>
the space of forty days ; and then leaving them with the<br>
explicit declaration that all power was given unto him in<br>
heaven and in earth, and with the express command<br>
therefore^ to go and teach all nations, baptizing them in<br>
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy<br>
Ghost — teaching them, to observe all things whatsoever<br>
he had comrnanded the disciples, and with the promise<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
14<br>
<br>
that he would be with them always, even unto the end of<br>
the world.<br>
<br>
Christian brethren and sisters ! when I undertook to<br>
discourse to you upon the subject of Education — upon<br>
the first superficial survey of my subject, under a sort of<br>
prepossession, that considerations connected with your<br>
temporal and worldly welfare would be the only motives<br>
proper to be presented by a layman to your minds, I<br>
naturally inquired of myself, as at the entrance of this<br>
address I have inquired of you, what I could possibly say<br>
to you for the promotion of the cause of education, which<br>
you do not daily and habitually say to yourselves ? But<br>
when, desirous of presenting in front the arguments which<br>
could operate at once upon your hearts and minds, I<br>
turned my thoughts to the principles and impulses which<br>
had influenced and directed your venerable ancestors, the<br>
first settlers of New England, the first and overruling mo-<br>
tive, which stood forth in prominent relief as the corner-stone<br>
of their History was Religion — the Christian Religion —<br>
And as this was not simply the Religion of Nature, but<br>
peculiarly the Religion of a Book, the first reference to<br>
that Book, its history and character, immediately disclosed<br>
the source of that deep and intense interest, that fervid<br>
and unceasing anxiety, which glowed in the bosoms of all<br>
the first founders of New England. The Religion of the<br>
Bible must be taught. It must be instilled into the mind<br>
of childhood, and believed even before it is understood.<br>
Worldly motives and interests, have been the exclusive or<br>
the predominating influences to the settlement of all other<br>
colonial establishments known to the history of mankind.<br>
The only exception of ancient history was the emigration<br>
of Abraham from Ur of Chaldea, and the subsequent<br>
exodus of his descendants, the children of Israel, from<br>
Egypt to settle in the promised land. They carried with<br>
them a Code of Laws delivered by God himself to Moses<br>
upon Mount Sinai, which they accepted by an express<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
15<br>
<br>
and formal covenant, often repeated by their posterity, and<br>
binding upon them through all the vicissitudes of their<br>
fortunes, till the promised Mediator of the New Covenant<br>
appeared in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. He came<br>
among them, declaring himself as having existed before<br>
Abraham, as commissioned expressly by his Father and<br>
their Father, by his God and their God, to deliver to them<br>
a New Law, to fulfil and partially to supersede the Law<br>
delivered from Sinai. He came claiming to be their<br>
prophet, priest and king — but he declared that his king-<br>
dom was not of this world — It was the kingdom of<br>
Heaven — It was the resurrection from death to immortal<br>
life, — and his new Law — his new command — first to his<br>
own people, the children of Israel, and then to the whole<br>
race of man in that and all succeeding ages — was the Law<br>
of Love, That they should love one another.<br>
<br>
This simple and all-pervading principle was not in the<br>
Law of Moses. It was not in any preexisting code of<br>
Laws ever imposed upon men. It was buried in the heart<br>
of man, blended and surrounded with every selfish and<br>
sordid passion to which his fall from Paradise had sur-<br>
rendered him. But it was there, and Jesus who knew<br>
what was in man brought it forth, and proclaimed it as<br>
the transcendent and paramount Law of man's nature.<br>
At the same time he told his disciples, that as a test of his<br>
principles he must himself sutler a cruel and ignominious<br>
death — a death reserved for malefactors and slaves. He<br>
told them, that they must all expect for proclaiming the<br>
glad tidings of his gospel to share his fate and suffer like<br>
him — That their own hearts were so incrusted with evil<br>
passions, and perverse customs and traditions, that they<br>
themselves did not fully comprehend the extent and<br>
universality of his Law — That to conform their practice<br>
to it, they must be regenerated, must be born again, and<br>
become entirely new men — That they themselves knew<br>
not what spirit they were of, and that devoted to him<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
16<br>
<br>
and his doctrines as they declared and believed themselves<br>
to be, they would all desert and deny him at his last<br>
hour — as they did.<br>
<br>
But he gave in his own person the proof of his doctrine<br>
of resurrection from the dead — and after that event, he<br>
promised them the Holy Ghost, as a Comforter for all<br>
they had suffered, and all they had yet to endure, and<br>
commanded them to go forth and teach all nations to ob-<br>
serve whatsoever things he had commanded them.<br>
<br>
Now this teaching of the commandments of Christ, to<br>
be observed by all nations, was by the express terms of<br>
the commission, recorded in the Gospel of St. Matthew, to<br>
continue to the end of the world — and wherever the<br>
Christian religion is established, this teaching must be to<br>
child/'e7i, and it must continue through life. For it is not<br>
only doctrine but observance that must be taught — Faith<br>
and Works.<br>
<br>
The doctrine of immortal life, is so congenial to the<br>
heart even of unregenerate man ; it is so soothing even to<br>
his selfish passions, that it is easily believed by all to<br>
whom it is taught. Though not explicitly revealed in<br>
the Old Testament, it was believed, not as an article of<br>
faith, but as a speculative opinion by the generality of the<br>
Jewish nation ; excepting by the sect of the Sadducees,<br>
who denied it altogether. A clear, undoubting conviction<br>
of it, is the first article of the Christian faith, and it is<br>
accordingly taught by Christians of every denomination.<br>
A future state of retribution, a resurrection of bliss to all<br>
who have done good, and of condemnation to all who<br>
have done evil, is also a fundamental article of Christianity,<br>
although the particular nature of the happiness to be en-<br>
joyed, and the nature and extent of the condemnation to<br>
be endured, have not been explicitly revealed.<br>
<br>
But the doctrine of eternal life, is not the only lesson to<br>
be taught by the disciples of Jesus to all nations, to the<br>
end of the world — ^it is to be taught in connection indis-<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
17<br>
<br>
soluble with the new commandment, to love one another.<br>
Among his last words at the table of the passover imme-<br>
diately before his death, he gave this neio commandment<br>
— and repeating it expressly said, "" by this shall all men<br>
know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to<br>
another.""<br>
<br>
This precept, too, was understood by all his apostles, as<br>
embracing the whole substance of his commands — nor has<br>
it ever been questioned by any human being, recognizing<br>
his authority as a divine teacher of religion and morals.<br>
<br>
And with these two principles universally received by<br>
all who call upon the name of Christ, and acknowledge<br>
him as their Lord and Master, how is it comprehensible,<br>
that this religion of awful responsibility to God for the<br>
observance of universal benevolence to man, should have<br>
been for more than sixteen hundred years, from the day<br>
of Christ's passion till the settlement of New England,<br>
the source and cause from age to age of the bloodiest and<br>
most desolating wars that ever afflicted the human race.<br>
By what unaccountable perversity in the composition of<br>
the animal man, the only animated being on the face of<br>
the terraqueous globe, endowed by his Creator with the<br>
faculty of reason, is it, that the religion of Conscience and<br>
of Love, of glory to God in the highest, and of peace on<br>
earth, good will to men, should in the process of its<br>
operations on the heart and mind of man towards that<br>
consummation of its destiny, promised and intended by its<br>
Founder, when the practice of Christians shall correspond<br>
with the Christian faith, and all the kingdoms of the<br>
earth shall become the kingdoms of the Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
have been doomed to make its way through oceans of<br>
blood — through ages of persecution, through hatred<br>
and revenge, through bigotry and superstition, through<br>
avarice and ambition, through fraud and hypocrisy,<br>
through lust and pride, through fanaticism and delu-<br>
sion, through all that the Spirit of evil cau devise and all<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
18<br>
<br>
that fallen man, .the compound of the tiger and the fox<br>
can perpetrate, to that serene empyrean of Heaven upon<br>
earth, when the Lion shall lie down with the Lamb,<br>
when the swords shall be beaten into ploughshares and<br>
the spears into pruning hooks — when nation shall no<br>
longer rise against nation, neither shall they learn war<br>
any more ?<br>
<br>
Christian Friends ! — The radical cause of this deplor-<br>
able inconsistency, and of all this melancholy depravity<br>
in the History of Mankind is defective Educaiion. That<br>
the human heart is deceitful above all things, and despe-<br>
rately wicked, had been said by divine inspiration, hun-<br>
dreds of years before the birth of the Redeemer, nor until<br>
his appearance upon earth had there been any improve-<br>
ment in its condition. Jesus was a teacher sent from God,<br>
to reveal the doctrine of immortal life and future retribu-<br>
tion, and to teach the way on earth to eternal blessedness<br>
in Heaven.<br>
<br>
But when the teacher has done his part, there remains<br>
to be performed the part of the learner. It was never<br>
promised by Jesus or his Apostles that the system of faith<br>
and of morals which he taught, should be forthwith re-<br>
ceived, understood and practised upon by all mankind. In<br>
confirmation of his doctrine of immortality, and to authen-<br>
ticate his mission from heaven, he performed miracles, or<br>
as he called them, mighty works. In illustration of the<br>
practice which he commanded his disciples to observe<br>
and to teach, he spoke in parables for the space of four<br>
years, disclosing even in minute detail the practical appli-<br>
cation of his new commandment of mutual love, to all the<br>
ordinary concerns of human life. But he came to teach,<br>
and not to compel. His Law was a Law of Liberty. He<br>
left the human mind and human action free, and the first<br>
lesson that he gave to his disciples was that he came to<br>
revolutionize the very nature of man — to regenerate him<br>
from the womb — to extirpate from his bosom all the evil<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
19<br>
<br>
passions to which he had been surrendered by the disobe-<br>
dience of his first parents to the commandment of God,<br>
and to purify unto himself a pecuhar people, zealous of<br>
good works. Bat he gave them no encouragement to<br>
hope that this revolution in the very nature of man would<br>
be immediately or even speedily accomplished. He fore-<br>
warned them that he must himself suffer death in confir-<br>
mation of his mission by the treachery of one of them-<br>
selves. He announced and bewailed the impending ruin<br>
and destruction of Chorazin, of Bethsaida, of Jerusalem<br>
herself, for the hardness of the hearts of their people, who<br>
despised his authority, and rejected his commands. He<br>
told them plainly that they should have persecution in<br>
the world in proportion to their fidelity to him, and that<br>
he came not to bring Peace upon earth but a sword.<br>
<br>
A sword say you ? for what ? for what but for self-<br>
defence ? He brought it not for conquest — for tyranny<br>
or oppression — but he brought it to be used by his dis-<br>
ciples for their own defence, in their conflicts with the<br>
world against the tyranny and oppression of others. He<br>
was himself put to death, as he had foretold he should be,<br>
and upon his trial, rebuked one of his earliest disciples,<br>
for using the sword that he had brought, not in self-<br>
defence, but in useless and furious animosity against a<br>
servant of the high priest.<br>
<br>
In the execution of the command which he gave them<br>
after his resurrection and immediately before his ascen-<br>
sion, to go forth and teach all nations till the end of the<br>
world to observe all the commands which he had delivered<br>
to them — they went forth and taught. For the space of<br>
more than three hundred years, they met in return for<br>
this teaching, persecution, martyrdom, and cruel death.<br>
Still they taught — and still according to that beautiful<br>
parable of their Lord and Master, of the sower and the<br>
seed — although much of their seed fell by the way side<br>
and was devoured by the fowls of the air, much upon<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
20<br>
<br>
stony places, where it could take no root, but sprang up<br>
and under a scorching sun, soon withered away ; much<br>
among thorns, which sprang up and choked them — yet<br>
other fell upon good ground, and brought forth fruit,<br>
some an hundred fold, some sixty fold, some thirty fold.<br>
And thus, under ten successive merciless decrees of so<br>
many Roman Emperors, masters of the world, prohibiting<br>
upon pain of death, this teaching of the disciples of Jesus,<br>
it was still making its way into the heart of man, irresis-<br>
tibly superseding the institutions of the Levitical Law,<br>
undermining and overthrowing the idolatrous worship of<br>
the Roman Empire, and prostrating before the simple<br>
command of mutual love from the lips of the Teacher of<br>
Nazareth, all the thrones and dominions, principalities and<br>
powers of the Earth.<br>
<br>
At length after more than three hundred years of pro-<br>
scription and persecution, the religion of Jesus ascended<br>
the imperial throne of the Ccesars, and was proclaimed<br>
mistress of the world. But alas ! the seed which until<br>
then had fallen by the way side and been devoured by<br>
the fowls of the air, was now destined to fall upon stony<br>
places, to spring up without root, and to wither away<br>
under the scorching sun of imperial power. Constantine<br>
adopted and professed and ordained the Christian religion,<br>
not in its own spirit of obedience to God and love to man,<br>
but as an instrument of conquest — as a weapon of war.<br>
He had seen or pretended to have seen a vision of a<br>
crucifix, at noon-day, transcending the light of the sun,<br>
and bearing the legible inscription in the Greek language<br>
— ""By this, conquer."" It was in the midst of a formidable<br>
war that this supernatural apparition presented itself to his<br>
eyes, which a cotemporary Christian historian, Eusebius,<br>
bishop of CaBsarea, declares was related by Constantine<br>
to himself many years after, confirmed by the solemnity<br>
of an oath. But whether this vision was the result of a<br>
fanatical delusion imposing upon the optical nerves of<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
21<br>
<br>
Constantine himself, or whether it was a fraudulent and<br>
deliberate imposture, it carried with it internal evidence,<br>
that the establishment of Christianity upon the throne of<br>
the world, was not in the true spirit of the Redeemer,<br>
life, immortality and brotherly love, but war, hatred and<br>
conquest. Constantine therefore stripped from all the<br>
warlike standards of the empire the bird of prey, the<br>
Roman Eagle ; and supplied his place with the Labarum,<br>
the conquering and unconquerable emblem of the cross —<br>
and thenceforth the banners of the cross themselves<br>
became the banners of fraud and imposture, and the<br>
standard of a crucified Saviour, was waved over em-<br>
battled legions marching to conquest, instead of peaceful<br>
disciples teaching all nations the law of immortal life<br>
and of brotherly love.<br>
<br>
And upon this vicious foundation was soon erected a<br>
system of ecclesiastical hierarchy, in the progress of which<br>
the bishops of Rome, assuming to be the successors of<br>
Saint Peter, with the pastoral staff of a shepherd and the<br>
ring of a fisherman, arrogated to themselves a dominion<br>
over their brethren of the Christian faith, to which no<br>
sovereign of earthly origin ever presumed to aspire. From<br>
teachers of the gospel of Christ they were gradually<br>
metamorphosed by the ascendancy which they acquired<br>
over the minds of men, not only into sovereign temporal<br>
princes, but into superior beings, exempt from all the<br>
infirmities of human nature, invested with absolute and<br>
uncontrollable power, armed with the authority of setting<br>
up and putting down kings, of absolving subjects from<br>
the ties of allegiance to their sovereigns, of laying whole<br>
nations under interdict, and of distributing at their dis-<br>
cretion all the territories of the earth ; and to cap the<br>
climax of blasphemy, not only to forgive and redeem<br>
from punishment the transgressions of men, but to grant<br>
for money indulgences for the perpetration of crimes.<br>
Can it be conceived as possible that this abominable<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
22<br>
<br>
system of fraud and imposture was actually consummated,<br>
originating in the adoption of Christianity by Constantine,<br>
commencing by small and imperceptible beginnings, but<br>
swelling and expanding into portentous immensity, for the<br>
space of nearly twelve hundred years, till the appointed<br>
day of Martin Luther.<br>
<br>
And during the same period, some of the seeds fell<br>
among thorns, which grew up with them and choked<br>
them — thorns of internal dissension and thorns of external<br>
war. Rival ambition had manifested itself among the<br>
twelve apostles of Jesus, even while he lived ; nor was it<br>
wholly extinguished by his severe admonition that they<br>
knew not what spirit they were of. Immediately after<br>
his decease, irritating debates and sharp animosities sprung<br>
up among them — multitudes of the Jewish converts main-<br>
taining that the whole Levitical law continued unre-<br>
pealed, and the proselytes from the gentiles inflexibly<br>
refusing to submit to the rite of circumcision, or to restrict<br>
themselves to the distinction between clean and unclean<br>
meats, or to encumber themselves with the burthensome<br>
ritual of the Mosaic law. In the Instructions of Jesus<br>
to his disciples, he had dwelt with emphatic solemnity<br>
upon the indispensable necessity of Faith in him and his<br>
doctrines, for admission to the kingdom of Heaven and<br>
for salvation to their immortal souls — but the law which<br>
he gave was a law of universal love, and no stronger<br>
evidence of Faith in him could be exhibited than by<br>
implicit observance of that Law. Now Faith, in the<br>
sense in which it was required by Jesus of his disciples,<br>
has been defined by the Apostle of the Gentiles ""the<br>
substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things<br>
not seen."" It is belief — a property of man's immortal<br>
soul, possessed by no other being upon earth. For belief<br>
gives to future time the anticipated certainty of the<br>
past — it annihilates time and space, and is the most<br>
powerful of all the arguments of natural religion to prove<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
23<br>
<br>
the immortal nature of man. Well then might Jesus and<br>
his Apostles, in their teaching of mankind, dwell upon the<br>
transcendent importance and irresistible efficacy of this<br>
passive faith, this firm belief in the divine mission of<br>
the Saviour and in the promises of his gospel, for there is<br>
another property of faiih^ by which it regulates the con-<br>
duct of men. This is active faith, and is the foundation<br>
of all the moral relations between man and his fellow-<br>
creature man. This faith in action, is the adamantine<br>
chain which holds the moral elements of the world<br>
together. Faith in its passive sense may be considered<br>
as synonymous with confidence — in its active sense with<br>
fidelity. The definition of faith by St. Paul in the 11th<br>
chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, is of passive<br>
faith — and he says elsewhere that it comes by hearing<br>
— and hearing by the word of God. But all the illus-<br>
trations throughout the whole of that chapter of the<br>
unbounded power of faith, consist of its efiicacy to the<br>
production of works ; as confidence in God ; as passive<br>
faith — belief in the omnipotence and goodness of God.<br>
<br>
You have all observed, my friends, in reading and<br>
comparing together the strong language of St. Paul in<br>
urging this all comprehensive power and influence of<br>
faith, with that of his brother Apostle James in the<br>
second chapter of his Epistle, where he seems to represent<br>
faith as altogether subordinate to works ; there is an<br>
apparent difierence between the two Apostles, as to the<br>
sense in which they understand the term Faith. The<br>
difference is only apparent. The definition of St. Paul<br>
is strictly confined to faith in its passive sense, as synony-<br>
mous with belief — confidence in God — but all his illus-<br>
trations, both special from Abel to Samuel and the prophets,<br>
and general, of the sufi'erings endured and of wonders per-<br>
formed by the faithful, are all, without a single exception,<br>
instances of faith manifested by works. So that St.<br>
James, who so emphatically declares that faith without<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
24<br>
<br>
works is dead, and that the devils believe and tremble,<br>
manifestly refers only to that faith which is synonymous<br>
with belief, while St, Paul as manifestly refers to that<br>
faith which is synonymous with fidelity — the faith<br>
which is manifested in action, by the performance of<br>
good works. There is therefore no real difference be-<br>
tween the doctrines of the two Apostles ; but need I tell<br>
you that there was a difference, a deep and radical dif-<br>
ference of impression upon the minds of the disciples who<br>
heard them, with regard to this doctrine of faith and<br>
works, which after a lapse of nearly nineteen hundred<br>
years yet remains unadjusted, and which even now may<br>
expose me to the suspicion of heresy for this simple state-<br>
ment of my own views of the case. I pray you to under-<br>
stand that I am not about to involve myself or you in the<br>
controversy between Faith and Works — that I only<br>
speak historically ; only point out to you some of the<br>
thorns of internal dissension among which the seed of<br>
the blessed gospel fell immediately after it had been sown,<br>
and in the first century of the Christian era. And then<br>
came the trials of the Apostles ; the repeated imprison-<br>
ments of Peter ; the martyrdom of Stephen by a frantic<br>
multitude, and of James by the tyrant Herod ; the cruel<br>
persecutions first inflicted and afterwards endured by<br>
Paul ; the charges against the Christians of setting fire<br>
to Rome by Nero, and the long train of ten Persecutions<br>
from that time till the conversion of Constantino — while<br>
at the same time from the teeming fancies of the converts<br>
to Christianity multitudes of wild"", extravagant and absurd<br>
sectarian creeds sprung up in the rank soil of the human<br>
heart, to obscure the divine light of the gospel and to choke<br>
the seed of the sower. The time will allow me barely to<br>
glance at the melancholy fertility of the successive growths<br>
of thorns which choked the seeds of the truth as it is in<br>
Jesus, for many centuries by the imposture of Mahomet<br>
founded upon the principle of inextinguishable War, in<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
25<br>
<br>
direct opposition to that of perpetual and universal Peace,<br>
the pure and simple doctrine of Christianity — or by that<br>
perversion of Cln-istian principle generated by the false<br>
religion of the Koran, the Crusades for the recovery of<br>
the Sepulchre of Christ from the infidels, and the short<br>
lived establishment of a Christian kingdom in what was<br>
termed the holy land.<br>
<br>
Of all these obstructions to the establishment of the<br>
peacetul kingdom of Christ upon earth, the most terrible<br>
and the most fatal, was the dominion which the bishops<br>
of Rome, in the name and as the pretended successors of<br>
Saint Peter, had usurped over the minds of men. Instead<br>
of teaching all nations the observance of the commands<br>
of Christ, the bishops of Rome had in a long succession<br>
of ages erected a Sovereignty for ruling all nations, and<br>
teaching them only the commands of men — and they<br>
ruled with a rod of iron. We all know that the reforma-<br>
tion of this anti-Christian system was commenced by<br>
Martin Luther, and that although for ages before, in-<br>
eifectual struggles against it had been crushed by its<br>
power, it was the monstrous pretension and practice of<br>
selling indulgences for the commission of crimes, which<br>
was first contested and then assailed by him as a teacher<br>
of nations to the observance of the commands of Christ,<br>
according to the commission given by the Saviour to his<br>
disciples at the moment preceding his ascension.<br>
<br>
Of the progress of the Protestant Reformation it is<br>
impossible for me here to speak ; but in discoursing to you<br>
upon the importance and the transcendent duties of edu-<br>
cation, I pray you to remark that the direct issue between<br>
the Protestant reformers and the papal usurpations was<br>
educatioti. It was the freedom of thought against or-<br>
ganized power. It had been established as one of the<br>
fundamental articles of the Catholic faith, that the Roman<br>
Pontiff — the head of the Church — was infallible — that<br>
his will was law. That the keys of Heaven had been<br>
4<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
26<br>
<br>
transmitted to him in uninterrupted succession from Saint<br>
Peter, and that aU other powers upon earth, were bound<br>
to imphcit obedience to his decrees, issued with a fraudulent<br>
semblance of humility in the professed capacity of a<br>
servant of servants. To secure this implicit obedience<br>
to his will, the word of God itself, the Scriptures of the<br>
Old and New Testament, were withheld from the in-<br>
spection of the People, and reserved to the exclusive<br>
possession of the Priesthood — for many ages not only<br>
the great mass of the People, but the Rulers of the earth,<br>
kings and emperors, were not even taught to read, and<br>
when in the revolutions of time, the languages in which<br>
the Oracles of God had been composed became extinct,<br>
no translation of them into any of the languages of modern<br>
Europe had been published, until Luther with his own<br>
hand, in defiance of the papal law, made the first trans-<br>
lation of them into German,<br>
<br>
Thus one of the first consequences of the Protestant<br>
Reformation was to unlock the Holy Scriptures to the<br>
understandings of the people — but that they might be<br>
qualified to receive them, it became indispensably neces-<br>
sary to teach the great mass of the people the art of read-<br>
ing. It was also necessary that this art should be taught<br>
in childhood ; not only because childhood is the period of<br>
human life best adapted to the reception of all religious<br>
impressions, but because the tenderness of affection for<br>
children had been signally manifested throughout his life<br>
by the Founder of Christianity, and because one of his<br>
most peremptory and affecting commands to his disciples<br>
had been, "" Suffer little children to come unto me, and<br>
forbid them not.""<br>
<br>
Education, then, the education of children, and the art<br>
of reading, was the primary impulse to the Protestant<br>
Reformation. The right of reading the Bible, was the<br>
first privilege secured to every follower of Christ, by the<br>
successful assault of Martin Luther upon the supremacy<br>
of the Church of Rome.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
27<br>
<br>
But the Reformation was the work of ages — it is not<br>
yet consummated. The Bible is the word of God, the<br>
seed of righteousness upon earth, and of blessedness in<br>
the world to come. But of this seed, much still falls by<br>
the way side, much on stony places, much among thorns ;<br>
and even of that which falls upon good ground, the returns<br>
are unequal, according to the richness of the soil and the<br>
variety of the seasons. Luther translated the Scriptures<br>
into the German language, and made them thus accessible<br>
to all his countrymen who could read. He was followed<br>
by a host of pious and learned men, of the other European<br>
nations, who translated the holy writings into the several<br>
languages of their respective countries, and thus the study<br>
of the Scriptures became the universal occupation of all<br>
the Christian nations. The invention of printing, which<br>
had preceded only by a few years the daring innovations<br>
of Luther, multiplied as the sands of the sea, the readers<br>
of the canonized books, and the splendid Polyglott Bible,<br>
compiled with immense labor, and published with princely<br>
magnificence by Cardinal Ximenes, furnished the learned<br>
patriarchs of the Reformation the means of correcting and<br>
improving their versions of the Old and New Testaments<br>
in the modern languages, by collating and comparing with<br>
each other not only the text of the Scriptures themselves,<br>
but the commentaries upon them and expositions of their<br>
contents, as well by the Doctors of the Jewish Sanhedrim,<br>
as by the Fathers of the Christian Church.<br>
<br>
The seals of divine revelation were thus broken, and<br>
the Bible was opened to the inspection and examination<br>
of the Protestant Christian throughout the world. But<br>
two steps further became indispensably necessary to the<br>
full enjoyment of the inestimable treasure thus dispensed<br>
to all classes of the community. The first was education<br>
— by dispensing to the whole people, the knowledge of<br>
the art of reading — and the second Avas the right of private<br>
judgment, or in other words the privilege of every reader,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
28<br>
<br>
to exercise the faculties of his own understanding in the<br>
interpretation of what he reads.<br>
<br>
And here we find the source of that inseparable connec-<br>
tion between knowledge, and virtue and liberty, which<br>
characterized your forefathers, the Puritan settlers of New<br>
England, beyond every other people upon earth. Other<br>
Colonies have been settled under the impulse of worldly<br>
interests — of commercial enterprise — of romantic adventure<br>
for the search of gold or silver mines, or from the baser<br>
motive of ambition varnished over with zeal — the conquest<br>
of unoffending nations under the hypocritical pretence of<br>
converting them to the Christian faith.<br>
<br>
The transcendent and overruling principle of the first<br>
settlers of New England, was Conscience. All the mon-<br>
archies of Christendom resisted the reformation of Luther.<br>
A war of thirty years was the immediate consequence of<br>
his secession from the Church of Rome, in his native land<br>
— a war, the ravages and desolation of which still arrest<br>
the traveller over those regions in his path, with the melan-<br>
choly reflection that the ruin inflicted by the hand of man,<br>
as it surpasses the destructive power, bids defiance even to<br>
the repairing hand of time. The wars of the Reformation<br>
extended over all Europe. They were modified by the<br>
political agitations and convulsions of the age. The spirit<br>
of reform was arrested in its progress by the apostacy of<br>
Henry the 4th in France — it severed from the crown of<br>
Spain the Provinces of the United Netherlands, and con-<br>
verted them into a Republic. It overthrew the dynasty<br>
of the Stuarts in Great Britain ; brought one of its monarchs<br>
to the block ; and expelled another and his family for-<br>
ever from the throne. In the process of these convulsions<br>
a portion of the people of England, withdrew from the<br>
field of persecution and of blood ; not from any motives<br>
of worldly welfare, but to the total sacrifice of them all,<br>
for the uninterrupted enjoyment of the rights of conscience ;<br>
for the privilege of holding the Holy Scriptures as their<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
29<br>
<br>
only rule of faith, and of interpreting them by the dictates<br>
of their own understanding.<br>
<br>
Now to a colony thus composed, the education of their<br>
children was a necessary of life more indispensable than<br>
food, or raiment, or shelter. Their bodies might perish<br>
by famine, or by nakedness, or by exposure to the inclem-<br>
ency of winter snows and barren rocks, in a region where<br>
it has recently been said that granite and ice are the only<br>
productions of nature — but animal life, the preservation of<br>
their bodies, was to them but a secondary concern. The<br>
food for which they hungered and thirsted was for the<br>
nourishment of the spirit, and the preservation of the<br>
never dying soul. This was the Faith that came by<br>
hearing. The first of all their wants was teachers —<br>
teachers for themselves — teachers for their children.<br>
<br>
Was I not then justified in saying that Education was<br>
the mother of New England ? — that the predominating<br>
and controlling impulse which brought our forefathers<br>
from a land where they were in the enjoyment of every<br>
temporal blessing, and which they tenderly loved, as their<br>
country, to a howling wilderness where they could enjoy<br>
nothing but Conscience and Freedom, was Education 7<br>
Such is the testimony of their History — what is the lan-<br>
guage of their Laws ?<br>
<br>
With the first settlers of the Massachusetts Colony,<br>
there came over learned and pious men, educated at the<br>
English Universities, and some of them among the most<br>
eminent divines of the age. On board the Arabella, the<br>
vessel in which Governor Winthrop came, religious<br>
worship was regularly performed, every Lord's day, even<br>
in the most tempestuous weather ; and immediately after<br>
their departure from the coast of England, they appointed<br>
two days in the week, upon which Mr. Phillips, their<br>
minister, catechised the people.<br>
<br>
On their arrival in this land, their first care was to keep<br>
a day of thanksgiving in all their plantations, and no<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
30<br>
<br>
sooner had they fixed upon the three hills as the spot for<br>
their settlement, than they formed themselves into a<br>
church, and chose Mr. Wilson their Teacher, Mr. Newell<br>
an Elder, and Mr. Gager and Mr. Aspenwall, Deacons.<br>
Nor is it to be forgotten that in our own town of Braintree,<br>
the gathering of the church preceded the incorporation of<br>
the town — that the primary cause of the formation of the<br>
church, was the inconvenience and sometimes impossibility<br>
for the inhabitants of Mount Wollaston to attend public<br>
worship at Boston, and that small as their numbers were,<br>
they chose two persons for the administration of their<br>
spiritual concerns, one under the denomination of Pastor,<br>
and the other of Teacher.<br>
<br>
Within six years after their landing in the wilderness,<br>
four hundred pounds were given by the General Court of<br>
the Massachusetts Colony towards the establishment of<br>
-a public school at Newtown, afterwards called Cambridge ;<br>
.and two years later, a teadter of the word of God, John<br>
Harvard, self-expatriated from England, as if by an ex-<br>
press dispensation of divine Providence, came, for one<br>
short year to break the bread of life to the Church at<br>
Charlestown, and then to depart for the world of spirits,<br>
leaving his whole fortune for the foundation of a College<br>
-which will bear his name in reverence and honor on the<br>
wings of Time to the end of the world.<br>
<br>
In the same year in which that illustrious body sent forth<br>
the first fruits of New England education to the world,<br>
the General Court enacted a law declaring, that "" For as<br>
much as the good education of children is of singular<br>
behoof and benefit to any commonwealth — that the<br>
.selectmen of every town, in the several precincts and<br>
quarters where they dwell, shall have a vigilant eye over<br>
their brethren and neighbors to see, first, that none of<br>
them shall sufler so much barbarism in any of their<br>
families as not to endeavor to teach, by themselves or<br>
kOthers, their children and apprentices, so much learning,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
31<br>
<br>
as may enable them perfectly to read the English tongue,<br>
and knowledge of the capital laws.""<br>
<br>
Also that all masters of families do once a week (at the<br>
least) catechise their children and servants in ilte grounds<br>
and principles of religion.<br>
<br>
There are other provisions in this law, all adapted to<br>
the purpose of carrying it into full execution.<br>
<br>
Four years later (in 1646) in the enactment of a code<br>
of criminal law, it was provided, that if any child or<br>
children, above sixteen years old, and of sufficient under-<br>
standing, shall curse or smite their Jiatural father or<br>
mother, he or they shall be put to death, unless it can be<br>
sufficiently testified that the parents have been very<br>
unchristianly negligent in the education of such children<br>
— and a law in the same words was some years afterwards<br>
enacted in the Plymouth Colony.<br>
<br>
And in May, 1647, in addition to all these preceding en-<br>
actments for the teaching of religion by the organization<br>
of Churches, and for the instruction of children in their<br>
families, a general law was passed, requiring of every<br>
township within the jurisdiction, consisting of fifty house-<br>
holders, to appoint forthwith, a teacher of all such chil-<br>
dren who should resort to him, to write and read, to be<br>
paid either by the parents or masters of such children or<br>
by the inhabitants of the town. And further, that every<br>
town consisting of one hundred families or householders-<br>
should set up a grammar school, the master thereof being<br>
able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the<br>
university.<br>
<br>
And listen to the beautiful — may I not say sublime<br>
preamble to this law, declaring the motive and purpose<br>
of its enactment.<br>
<br>
"" It being one chief project of Satan to keep man from<br>
the knowledge of the Scripture, as in former times keep-<br>
ing them in unknown tongues, so in these latter times by<br>
persuading from the use of tongues, that so at least the<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
32<br>
<br>
true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded<br>
and corrupted with false glosses of deceivers ; to the end<br>
that learning may not be buried in the graves of our fore-<br>
fathers, in Church and Commonwealth, the Lord assisting<br>
our endeavors. It is therefore ordered by this court and<br>
authority thereof,"" &amp;c.<br>
<br>
Here then, in the Laws enacted by the first settlers of<br>
New England, is a complete system of instruction, based<br>
upon the principle that human life, from the cradle to the<br>
grave, is a school — That at every period of his existence,<br>
man wants a teacher, and that his pilgrimage upon earth<br>
is but a term of childhood, in which he is to be educated<br>
for the manhood of a brighter world. Let the scoffer at<br>
the demure spirit and austere manners of the Puritans,<br>
survey the history of mankind — let him ransack the<br>
annals of every gathering of man into society from the<br>
confusion of Babel to the settlement of Sierra Leone, New<br>
South Wales or Liberia, and find a parallel to this primi-<br>
tive code of New England Colonial Law !<br>
<br>
This system continued in full force until, in the progress<br>
and vicissitudes of the reformation in the parent coun-<br>
try, the charter of the Colony was annulled by the despi-<br>
cable tyrant Charles the Second. Immediately after the<br>
revolution of 1688, a new Charter was obtained from<br>
William and Mary, including the Colonies of Massachu-<br>
setts and Plymouth as well as the District of Maine and<br>
Nova Scotia. By the vacation of the Charter, all the<br>
preceding Colonial Laws were understood to have been<br>
superseded with it, and as the jurisdiction of the New<br>
Province extended over several preceding Colonies, which<br>
had been governed by different laws, an entire new<br>
system of Legislation became necessary. Hence, among<br>
the laws of the very first sessions of the General Court<br>
mider the new Charter, was an Act for the Settlement<br>
and Support of Ministers and Schoolmasters.<br>
<br>
This Statute preserved and fortified the system of<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
33<br>
<br>
education which sixty years before had been established<br>
by the founders of the Colony — the system of universal<br>
education, providing at once for the support of the Pastor<br>
and the Schoolmaster, the teacher of adult age and the<br>
teacher of children, by the common contributions of all.<br>
In proportion as the population, and the worldly wealth of<br>
the Province increased, this system was expanded and<br>
enlarged by subsidiary legislation, till the revolution<br>
which severed the North American Colonies from the<br>
British Empire, At that time, when the People of the<br>
Commonwealth were called upon in their sovereign<br>
capacity to form a Constitution of Government for them-<br>
selves, they declared by a special Article in their Declara-<br>
tion of Rights, that as the happiness of a people, and the<br>
good order and preservation of civil government, essentially<br>
depend upon piety, religion and morality ; and as these can-<br>
not be generally diffused through a community, but by the<br>
institution of the public worship of God, and of public<br>
instructions in piety, religion and morality, therefore the<br>
Legislature were authorized to require the several towns,<br>
parishes, precincts and other bodies politic or religious<br>
societies, to make suitable provision, at their own expense,<br>
for the institution of the public worship of God, and for<br>
the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers<br>
of piety, religion and morality, in all cases where such pro-<br>
vision shall not be made voluntarily.<br>
<br>
Such was the opinion and such the ordinance of your<br>
fathers in the days of their severest trials, and when their<br>
afflictions taught them to place all their reliance upon<br>
their Creator. The people of Massachusetts in their days<br>
of prosperity and enjoyment have seen fit to repeal this<br>
Article of their Bill of Rights, and to leave the support of<br>
religion and morality, and of their teachers to the volun-<br>
tary contributions of the People alone. Fondly would I<br>
hope that this constitutional alteration has proceeded from<br>
no growing indifference to the cause of piety, religion and<br>
5<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
34<br>
<br>
morality, but from a firm conviction that they will be as<br>
liberally and effectively supported by voluntary contribu-<br>
tion, as they ever have been by legislative enactment.<br>
<br>
The Constitution of the Commonwealth had also a<br>
special Chapter, for the preservation, protection, and pro-<br>
motion of all the rights, privileges and immunities of<br>
Harvard University ; and the general encouragement of<br>
Literature — making it the special duty of Legislatures and<br>
Magistrates in all future periods of the Commonwealth, to<br>
cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, and all<br>
seminaries of them : especially the University at Cam-<br>
bridge, public schools, and grammar schools in the towns.<br>
<br>
From these provisions in the Constitution of the State,<br>
we have ample evidence, that at no period of our history<br>
has the interest of the People in behalf of education been<br>
more ardent and intense than it was at the time when in<br>
the midst of a most calamitous and terrible civil war, they<br>
were first summoned to exercise the rights and to wield<br>
the powers of an Independent People.<br>
<br>
I have already detained you too long to protract the<br>
call upon your attention, by entering upon a detail of the<br>
legislation of the Commonwealth on the subject of edu-<br>
cation since that time. It is no pleasant recollection to<br>
bring to your minds, and it is yet a duty with which I<br>
cannot dispense, to remark that the very first act of legis-<br>
lation under the government of the Commonwealth, for<br>
the instruction of youth, and for the promotion of good<br>
education, presents a painful relaxation if not an inex-<br>
cusable dereliction of the spirit which until then had<br>
animated all our forefathers. The act of 1693, merely<br>
repeating the provisions of that of 1647, required that<br>
every town having the number of fifty householders, or<br>
upwards, should be consianily provided of a schoolmaster<br>
to teach children to read and write, and that in every<br>
town of one hundred families, there should be kept a<br>
grammar school, by a person well instructed in the<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
35<br>
<br>
tongues. In the act of 1789, the duty requh-ed of towns<br>
of fifty householders is only to have schoolmasters to<br>
teach reading and writing, for such term of time as shall<br>
be equivalent to six months for one school in each year.<br>
Towns of one hundred families only, were required to<br>
keep a teacher of reading and writing the year round ; and<br>
only towns of two hundred families to keep a grammar<br>
school.<br>
<br>
You will observe that by this alteration of the law,<br>
one-half the time of all the children of the Common-<br>
wealth, of teachable age for learning to read and write,<br>
was taken away, and the same principle as might easily<br>
be shown pervaded the whole law, diminishing the facili-<br>
ties for acquiring education, provided by the law, at least<br>
by one-half. What were the motives for this change I<br>
presume not now to inquire ; but I cannot otherwise than<br>
consider it as evidence of an unhappy decline of that<br>
fervid spirit, for the education of children, which was so<br>
signally characteristic of the Pilgrim fathers of the Colony<br>
— of the native fathers of the Province — and of the<br>
founders of the Constitutional Commonwealth, The<br>
general spirit of your laws relative to education, since<br>
that time, has been to multiply the objects of study upon<br>
your children, and to diminish the time which you allow<br>
them for making the acquisition of learning. This evil<br>
has not yet been removed. You may be startled at<br>
hearing that since the act of 1789, you yourselves have<br>
enjoyed facilities of learning at most half equal to those<br>
which your forefathers enjoyed from the first settlement<br>
of the Colony — and that your children now enjoy no<br>
more than you have possessed yourselves. I speak not now<br>
of private schools and academies endowed by the benefi-<br>
cence of individuals, or accessible to the children of<br>
opulence ; but of schools provided by law, and accessible<br>
to the children of all. In very recent years, the People<br>
of the Commonwealth have kindled with a fresh ardor<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
^<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
36<br>
<br>
in the cause of education, and their Legislature have<br>
shared largely of their noble enthusiasm. The annual<br>
returns of schools, from all the towns of the Common-<br>
wealth ; the institution of a liberal and enlightened Board<br>
of Education ; the annual reports and indefatigable labors<br>
of their able and eloquent Secretary ; and the provision<br>
made, by an affecting union of individual munificence<br>
with public bounty, for normal schools, to elevate the<br>
standard of instruction by the education of accomplished<br>
teachers — all these are pledges of delightful promise for<br>
the improvement of the rising and future generations.<br>
<br>
But my friends and brethren of my native town, to<br>
return to the radical thought upon which I invited you<br>
to consider this subject, and which you may perhaps<br>
think more appropriate to the religious exercises of the<br>
Lord's day, and to the hallowed lips of your reverend<br>
pastor, than to the amusement of a weekday, and the<br>
discourse of a man of the world, let me close as I began<br>
with intreating you to bear in mind that the invincible<br>
spirit which brought your Puritan fathers to New Eng-<br>
land, was Education. Let us impress it indelibly on our<br>
own minds ; let us impress it to the extent of our ability<br>
upon others, that Education is the business of human life<br>
— that our religion is the religion of a book — and that the<br>
meaning of that book is intrusted by divine Providence<br>
to the deliberate judgment of our own understandings.<br>
That as the child must be educated for manhood upon<br>
earth, so the man must be educated upon earth, for<br>
heaven ; and finally that where the foundation is not laid<br>
in Time, the superstructure cannot rise for Eternity.</p>

Tell you, you're the greatest<br>
But once you turn, they hate us (ha)<br>
<br>
Oh, the misery<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>

My enemy (yeah)<br>
(Look out for yourself)<br>
Uh, look, okay<br>
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me<br>
I'm praying that somebody hope for me<br>
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be<br>
P-posted, being a wreck of emotions<br>
Ready to go whenever, just let me know<br>
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor<br>
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""<br>
They wanna plot on my trot to the top<br>
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box<br>
I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock<br>
To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I had it<br>
And I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'<br>
They want a static with precision, I'm automatic quarterback<br>
I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up<br>
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Oh, the misery<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
Spare the sympathy<br>
Everybody wants to be my enemy (I swear)<br>
Pray it away, I swear, I'll never be a saint, no way<br>

Pray it away, I swear, I'll never be a saint<br>

<br>
[Pre-coro: Alex Favela]<br>
En mi Mojave, yo me acuerdo de ti<br>
Me di un salazo y un perico pa' olvidarme de ti<br>
Ando manejando por las calles donde te vi<br>
Traigo la Forty para el gato que te aleje de mí<br>
Que no se asome porque<br>

[Coro: Joaquín Medina]<br>
Trae tostón arriba del Convoy<br>
Las babys y el alcohol<br>
Ya me pegué un jalón<br>
Pues es lo verga, la mota en su entrepierna<br>
Me dio su vape de menta<br>
Quiere que se lo dé en la camioneta<br>
Quiere que se lo meta<br>
Prueba una molly y se calienta<br>
Se viene y ni la piensa</p>

[Verso]<br>
Baby, recuesta aquí tu cabeza en mi pecho<br>
Hace ya meses que esto siento tenso<br>
No miento, aquí en mi cora lo presiento<br>
No me dices nada, quieres discutir<br>
Baby, recuerda que yo vivo de momentos<br>
Tendré que borrar fotos y videos<br>
A la verga, se fueron nuestros recuerdos<br>
¿Qué es lo que te cambia? Tú no eras así<br>
<br>
[Coro]<br>
Y me dijo tu mamá<br>
Si nos miró tan feliz, por qué te portas así<br>
Cuando todo te lo daba, yo siеmpre pensaba en ti<br>
Y tus bеsos son tatuajes, nunca se arrancan de mí<br>
Y me dijo tu mamá<br>
Que por qué ando de cabrón, que qué fue lo que pasó<br>
Que me miro más tatuado, que qué es eso de ""sad boy""<br>
Le dije: ""¿Doña, qué hago si su hija me lastimó?""<br>
<br>
[Interludio]<br>
Uh<br>
Puro Junior H<br>

[Coro]<br>
Y me dijo tu mamá<br>
Si nos miró tan feliz, por qué te portas así<br>
Cuando todo te lo daba, yo siempre pensaba en ti<br>
Y tus besos son tatuajes, nunca se arrancan de mí<br>
Y me dijo tu mamá<br>
Que por qué ando de cabrón, que qué fue lo que pasó<br>
Que me miro más tatuado, que qué es eso de ""sad boy""<br>
Le dije: ""¿Doña, qué hago si su hija me lastimó?""<br>

A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight<br>

Here to stay is a new bird<br>
He sings a love song as we go along<br>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br>
In the meadow we can build a snowman<br>
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown<br>
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No man""<br>

Later on we'll conspire<br>
As we dream by the fire<br>
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made<br>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br>
Over the ground lies the mantle of light<br>
A heaven of diamond in the lovely night<br>
In the meadow we can build a snowman<br>
Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown<br>
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" And then we'll say, ""No man""<br>

"<p>[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]<br>
Let me take the night, I love real easy<br>
And I know that you'll still wanna see me<br>
On the Sunday morning, music real loud<br>
Let me love you while the moon is still out<br>
<br>

Something in you lit up heaven in me<br>
The feeling won't let me sleep<br>
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel<br>

One kiss is all it takes<br>
Fallin' in love with me<br>

",rap,D
"<p>John and Mitchy were gettin' kinda itchy<br>
Just to leave their folk music behind<br>
Zal and Denny workin' for a penny<br>
Tryin' to get a fish on the line<br>
In a coffee house Sebastian sat<br>
And after every number they'd pass the hat<br>
McGuinn and McGuire just a-gettin' higher in L.A<br>
You know where that's at<br>
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass<br>
Zal he said, ""Denny, you know there aren't many<br>
Who can sing a song the way that you do, let's go South""<br>
Denny said, ""Zally, golly, don't you think that I wish<br>
I could play guitar like you""<br>
Zal, Denny, and Sebastian sat, at the Night Owl<br>
And after every number they'd pass the hat<br>
McGuinn and McGuire still a-gettin higher in L.A<br>
You know where that's at<br>
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass<br>
When Cass was a sophomore, planned to go to Swarthmore<br>
But she changed her mind one day<br>
Standin' on the turnpike, thumb out to hitchhike<br>
""Take me to New York right away""<br>
When Denny met Cass, he gave her love bumps<br>
Called John and Zal and that was the Mugwumps<br>
McGuinn and McGuire couldn't get no higher<br>
But that's what they were aimin' at<br>
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass<br>
Mugwumps, high jumps, low slumps, big bumps<br>
Don't you work as hard as you play<br>
Make up, break up, everything is shake up<br>
Guess it had to be that way<br>
Sebastian and Zal formed the spoonful<br>
Michelle, John, and Denny gettin' very tuneful<br>
McGuinn and McGuire just a-catchin' fire in L.A<br>
You know where that's at<br>
And everybody's gettin' fat except Mama Cass<br>
Broke, busted, disgusted, agents can't be trusted<br>
And Mitchy wants to go to the sea<br>
Cass can't make it, she says, ""We'll have to fake it""<br>
We knew she'd come eventually<br>
Greasin' on American Express cards<br>
Tents low rent, but keepin' out the heat's hard<br>
Duffy's good vibrations and our imaginations<br>
Can't go on indefinitely<br>
And California dreamin' is becomin' a reality</p>

<br>
[Pre-Estribillo]<br>
El antro está lleno, pero llego y más se llena (Más se llena)<br>
Cuando llego se levanta la cadena (Prra)<br>
Tu novio se gana en año y medio mi quincena<br>
La niña obscena, no le da pena (No le da—, no le da—)<br>
<br>
[Estribillo]<br>
Pu-Pu-Puta, arrímame tu culo pero ya<br>
Tiene casa, pero no tiene que llegar (No, no, no, no)<br>
Puta, arrímame tu culo pero ya<br>
Se mueven más rico las que no tienen papá (Puta, puta)<br>
Pu-Pu-Pu-Puta, arrímame tu culo pero ya (Pero ya)<br>
Tiene casa, pero no tiene que llegar (No, no, no, no)<br>
Pu-Puta, arrímame tu culo pero ya<br>
Se mueven más rico las que no tienen papá<br>

Me encanta cuando lo lames, te voy a dar el jarabe<br>
Nadie me cambia los planes, ni a los Jóvenes Titanes (No, no, no)<br>
Si te parto el ano es para que el pito me embarres (Ouh, shit)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Estribillo]<br>
Em-Em-Embárramelo todo y escúpeme en la boca (Prra)<br>
Sabes que nadie como tu papi te provoca<br>

[Verso 2]<br>
Abre l—, abre l—, abre l—, abre las dos patas, te voy a dejar los tenis puestos, obvio<br>
Para que sea fácil correr si llega tu novio (Jaja)<br>
Al rey del morbo nadie le quitará el podio<br>
Te chupo la vagina, niña, con todo y microbios, delicioso<br>
Si va a tronar, que truene (Que truene)<br>
Te la meto el sábado y te la saco hasta el jueves<br>
Vente con tu prima, para las dos tengo pene<br>
El puercototote, pero siempre con higiene<br>
Te quito con los dientes blancotes ese Michael Kors<br>
Yo no me vacuné, ay, qué rico que tengas tos<br>
Tó-Tó-Tóseme, yo quiero la infección (Yeah, yeah)<br>
A mí se me para hasta con la escena lésbica en la peli de Buzz<br>
<br>

Te hizo falta tu papá, por eso quieres que te pegue (Que te pegue)<br>
Terminas llorando pero me gusta que ruegues<br>

"<p>[Deutscher Songtext zu „STAR WALKIN’ (League of Legends Worlds Anthem)“]<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Sag niemals, dass es vorbei ist, wenn ich atme<br>
Renne zum Mondlicht und ich beschleunige<br>
Ich bin auf dem Weg zu den Sternen, bereit, weit zu gehen<br>
Ich laufe auf den Sternen<br>
Sag niemals, dass es vorbei ist, wenn ich atme<br>
Renne zum Mondlicht und ich beschleunige<br>
Ich bin auf dem Weg zu den Sternen, bereit, weit zu gеhen<br>
Ich laufe auf den Stеrnen<br>
<br>
[Strophe 1]<br>
Auf der Mission, ganz hoch zu kommen<br>
Ich weiß, dass ich dabei sterben werde, nach einem Leben zu greifen, das ich eigentlich überhaupt nicht brauche<br>
Nie auf Antworten gehört, habe eine Lektion von den Weisen gelernt<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Du solltest niemals einen Ratschlag von einem Nigga annehmen, der es nicht versucht<br>
Sie sagten, ich würde es nicht lebendig raus schaffen<br>
Sie sagten mir, ich würde nie den Aufstieg sehen<br>
Deshalb muss ich sie jedes mal töten (Muss sie auch bluten sehen)<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Sag niemals, dass es vorbei ist, wenn ich atme<br>
Renne zum Mondlicht und ich beschleunige<br>
Ich bin auf dem Weg zu den Sternen, bereit, weit zu gehen<br>
Ich laufe auf den Sternen<br>
Sag niemals, dass es vorbei ist, wenn ich atme<br>
Renne zum Mondlicht und ich beschleunige<br>
Ich bin auf dem Weg zu den Sternen, bereit, weit zu gehen<br>
Ich laufe auf den Sternen<br>
<br>
[Strophe 2]<br>
War dieser Nigga, seit ich aus meiner Mama kam (Wuh)<br>
Danke Gott, dass Papa nie ein Kondom trug (Wuh)<br>
Beweise jedes Mal, dass sie falsch liegen, bis es normal ist<br>
Warum sollte man Legenden huldigen, wenn du weißt, dass du ihnen beitreten kannst? (Ihnen beitreten kannst)<br>
Diese Niggas mögen mich nicht, sie mögen mich nicht<br>
Wahrscheinlich wollen sie mich bekämpfen<br>
Kommt schon, versucht es, macht euch nichts vor<br>
Sie haben mich runter gedrückt, aber ich habe nie geschrien<br>
Warum ich?<br>
Wort von den Weisen<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Sag niemals, dass es vorbei ist, wenn ich atme<br>
Renne zum Mondlicht und ich beschleunige<br>
Ich bin auf dem Weg zu den Sternen, bereit, weit zu gehen<br>
Ich laufe auf den Sternen<br>
Sag niemals, dass es vorbei ist, wenn ich atme<br>
Renne zum Mondlicht und ich beschleunige<br>
Ich bin auf dem Weg zu den Sternen, bereit, weit zu gehen<br>
Ich laufe auf den Sternen<br>
(Laufe auf den Sternen)<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Sag niemals, dass es vorbei ist, wenn ich atme<br>
Renne zum Mondlicht und ich beschleunige<br>
Ich bin auf dem Weg zu den Sternen, bereit, weit zu gehen<br>
Ich laufe auf den Sternen</p>

Sentado en tu casa llorando esperando que llame (Yeah)<br>
'Tás sufriendo por mí<br>
No es por nada pero yo disfruto que el karma te gane<br>
Baby no es maldad, ni es por engreída<br>
Pero ojo por ojo, diente por diente, ley de la vida<br>

The party's on<br>
The spirit's up<br>
We're here tonight<br>

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime<br>
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime<br>

",pop,C
"<p>Let us begin with the Self in its widest acceptation, and follow it up to its most delicate and subtle form, advancing from the study of the empirical, as the Germans call it, to that of the pure, Ego.<br>
The Empirical Self or Me. The Empirical Self of each of us is all that he is tempted to call by the name of me. But it is clear that between what a man calls me and what he simply calls mine the line is difficult to draw. We feel and act about certain things that are ours very much as we feel and act about ourselves. Our fame, our children, the work of our hands, may be as dear to us as our bodies are, and arouse the same feelings and the same acts of reprisal if attacked. And our bodies themselves, are they simply ours, or are they us? Certainly men have been ready to disown their very bodies and to regard them as mere vestures, or even as prisons of clay from which they should some day be glad to escape.<br>
<br>
We see then that we are dealing with a fluctuating material. The same object being sometimes treated as a part of me, at other times as simply mine, and then again as if I had nothing to do with it at all. In its widest possible sense, however, a man's Self is the sum total of all that he CAN call his, not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account. All these things give him the same emotions. If they wax and prosper, he feels triumphant; if they dwindle and die away, he feels cast down, - not necessarily in the same degree for each thing, but in much the same way for all. Understanding the Self in this widest sense, we may begin by dividing the history of it into three parts, relating respectively to -<br>
<br>
1. Its constituents;<br>
2. The feelings and emotions they arouse, -- Self-feelings;<br>
3. The actions to which they prompt, -- Self-seeking and Self-preservation.<br>
<br>
1. The constituents of the Self may be divided into two classes, those which make up respectively -<br>
<br>
(a) The material Self;<br>
(b) The social Self;<br>
(c) The spiritual Self; and<br>
(d) The pure Ego.<br>
<br>
<br>
(a) The body is the innermost part of the material Self in each of us; and certain parts of the body seem more intimately ours than the rest. The clothes come next. The old saying that the human person is composed of three parts - soul, body and clothes - is more than a joke. We so appropriate our clothes and identify ourselves with them that there are few of us who, if asked to choose between having a beautiful body clad in raiment perpetually shabby and unclean, and having an ugly and blemished form always spotlessly attired, would not hesitate a moment before making a decisive reply.[1] Next, our immediate family is a part of ourselves. Our father and mother, our wife and babes, are bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. When they die, a part of our very selves is gone. If they do anything wrong, it is our shame. If they are insulted, our anger flashes forth as readily as if we stood in their place. Our home comes next. Its scenes are part of our life; its aspects awaken the tenderest feelings of affection; and we do not easily forgive the stranger who, in visiting it, finds fault with its arrangements or treats it with contempt. All these different things are the objects of instinctive preferences coupled with the most important practical interests of life. We all have a blind impulse to watch over our body, to deck it with clothing of an ornamental sort, to cherish parents, wife and babes, and to find for ourselves a home of our own which we may live in and 'improve.'<br>
<br>
An equally instinctive impulse drives us to collect property; and the collections thus made become, with different degrees of intimacy, parts of our empirical selves. The parts of our wealth most intimately ours are those which are saturated with our labor. There are few men who would not feel personally annihilated if a life-long construction of their hands or brains - say an entomological collection or an extensive work in manuscript - were suddenly swept away. The miser feels similarly towards his gold, and although it is true that a part of our depression at the loss of possessions is due to our feeling that we must now go without certain goods that we expected the possessions to bring in their train, yet in every case there remains, over and above this, a sense of the shrinkage of our personality, a partial conversion of ourselves to nothingness, which is a psychological phenomenon by itself. We are all at once assimilated to the tramps and poor devils whom we so despise, and at the same time removed farther than ever away from the happy sons of earth who lord it over land and sea and men in the full-blown lustihood that wealth and power can give, and before whom, stiffen ourselves as we will by appealing to anti-snobbish first principles, we cannot escape an emotion, open or sneaking, of respect and dread.<br>
<br>
(b) A man's Social Self is the recognition which he gets from his mates. We are not only gregarious animals, liking to be in sight of our fellows, but we have an innate propensity to get ourselves noticed, and noticed favorably, by our kind. No more fiendish punishment could be devised, were such a thing physically possible, than that one should be turned loose in society and remain absolutely unnoticed by all the members thereof. If no one turned round when we entered, answered when we spoke, or minded what we did, but if every person we met 'cut us dead,' and acted as if we were non-existing things, a kind of rage and impotent despair would ere long well up in us, from which the cruellest bodily tortures would be a relief; for these would make us feel that, however bad might be our plight, we had not sunk to such a depth as to be unworthy of attention at all.<br>
<br>
Properly speaking, a man has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him and carry an image of him in their mind. To wound any one of these his images is to wound him.[2] But as the individuals who carry the images fall naturally into classes, we may practically say that he has as many different social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself to each of these different groups. Many a youth who is demure enough before his parents and teachers, swears and swaggers like a pirate among his 'tough' young friends. We do not show ourselves to our children as to our club-companions, to our customers as to the laborers we employ, to our own masters and employers as to our intimate friends. From this there results what practically is a division of the man into several selves; and this may be a discordant splitting, as where one is afraid to let one set of his acquaintances know him as he is elsewhere; or it may be a perfectly harmonious division of labor, as where one tender to his children is stern to the soldiers or prisoners under his command.<br>
<br>
The most peculiar social self which one is apt to have is in the mind of the person one is in love with. The good or bad fortunes of this self cause the most intense elation and dejection - unreasonable enough as measured by every other standard than that of the organic feeling of the individual. To his own consciousness he is not, so long as this particular social self fails to get recognition, and when it is recognized his contentment passes all bounds.<br>
<br>
A man's fame, good or bad, and his honor or dishonor, are names for one of his social selves. The particular social self of a man called his honor is usually the result of one of those splittings of which we have spoken. It is his image in the eyes of his own 'set,' which exalts or con- demns him as he conforms or not to certain requirements that may not be made of one in another walk of life. Thus a layman may abandon a city infected with cholera; but a priest or a doctor would think such an act incompatible with his honor. A soldier's honor requires him to fight or to die under circumstances where another man can apologize or run away with no stain upon his social self. A judge, a statesman, are in like manner debarred by the honor of their cloth from entering into pecuniary relations perfectly honorable to persons in private life. Nothing is commoner than to hear people discriminate between their different selves of this sort: ""As a man I pity you, but as an official I must show you no mercy; as a politician I regard him as an ally, but as a moralist I loathe him;"" etc., etc. What may be called 'club-opinion' is one of the very strongest forces in life.[3] The thief must not steal from other thieves; the gambler must pay his gambling-debts, though he pay no other debts in the world. The code of honor of fashionable society has throughout history been full of permissions as well as of vetoes, the only reason for following either of which is that so we best serve one of our social selves. You must not lie in general, but you may lie as much as you please if asked about your relations with a lady; you must accept a challenge from an equal, but if challenged by an inferior you may laugh him to scorn: these are examples of what is meant.<br>
<br>
(c) By the Spiritual Self, so far as it belongs to the Empirical Me, I mean a man's inner or subjective being, his psychic faculties or dispositions, taken concretely; not the bare principle of personal Unity, or 'pure' Ego, which remains still to be discussed. These psychic dispositions are the most enduring and intimate part of the self, that which we most verily seem to be. We take a purer self-satisfaction when we think of our ability to argue and discriminate, of our moral sensibility and conscience, of our indomitable will, than when we survey any of our other possessions. Only when these are altered is a man said to be alienatus a se.<br>
<br>
Now this spiritual self may be considered in various ways. We may divide it into faculties, as just instanced, isolating them one from another, and identifying ourselves with either in turn. This is an abstract way of dealing with consciousness, in which, as it actually presents itself, a plurality of such faculties are always to be simultaneously found; or we may insist on a concrete view, and then the spiritual self in us will be either the entire stream of our personal consciousness, or the present 'segment' or 'section' of that stream, according as we take a broader or a narrower view - both the stream and the section being concrete existences in time, and each being a unity after its own peculiar kind. But whether we take it abstractly or concretely, our considering the spiritual self at all is a reflective process, is the result of our abandoning the outward-looking point of view, and of our having become able to think of subjectivity as such, to think ourselves as thinkers.<br>
<br>
This attention to thought as such, and the identification of ourselves with it rather than with any of the objects which it reveals, is a momentous and in some respects a rather mysterious operation, of which we need here only say that as a matter of fact it exists; and that in everyone, at an early age, the distinction between thought as such, and what it is 'of' or 'about,' has become familiar to the mind. The deeper grounds for this discrimination may possibly be hard to find; but superficial grounds are plenty and near at hand. Almost anyone will tell us that thought is a different sort of existence from things, because many sorts of thought are of no things - e.g., pleasures, pains, and emotions; others are of non-existent things - errors and fictions; others again of existent things, but in a form that is symbolic and does not resemble them - abstract ideas and concepts; whilst in the thoughts that do resemble the things they are 'of' (percepts, sensations), we can feel, alongside of the thing known, the thought of it going on as an altogether separate act and operation in the mind.<br>
<br>
Now this subjective life of ours, distinguished as such so clearly from the objects known by its means, may, as aforesaid, be taken by us in a concrete or in an abstract way. Of the concrete way I will say nothing just now, except that the actual 'section' of the stream will ere long, in our discussion of the nature of the principle of unity in consciousness, play a very important part. The abstract way claims our attention first. If the stream as a whole is identified with the Self far more than any outward thing, a certain portion of the stream abstracted from the rest is so identified in an altogether peculiar degree, and is felt by all men as a sort of innermost centre within the circle, of sanctuary within the citadel, constituted by the subjective life as a whole. Compared with this element of the stream, the other parts, even of the subjective life, seem transient external possessions, of which each in turn can be disowned, whilst that which disowns them remains. Now, what is this self of all the other selves?<br>
<br>
Probably all men would describe it in much the same way up to a certain point. They would call it the active element in all consciousness; saying that whatever qualities a man's feelings may possess, or whatever content his thought may include, there is a spiritual something in him which seems to go out to meet these qualities and contents, whilst they seem to come in to be received by it. It is what welcomes or rejects. It presides over the perception of sensations, and by giving or withholding its assent it influences the movements they tend to arouse. It is the home of interest, - not the pleasant or the painful, not even pleasure or pain, as such, but that within us to which pleasure and pain, the pleasant and the painful, speak. It is the source of effort and attention, and the place from which appear to emanate the fiats of the will. A physiologist who should reflect upon it in his own person could hardly help, I should think, connecting it more or less vaguely with the process by which ideas or incoming sensations are 'reflected' or pass over into outward acts. Not necessarily that it should be this process or the mere feeling of this process, but that it should be in some close way related to this process; for it plays a part analogous to it in the psychic life, being a sort of junction at which sensory ideas terminate and from which motor ideas proceed, and forming a kind of link between the two. Being more incessantly there than any other single element of the mental life, the other elements end by seeming to accrete round it and to belong to it. It becomes opposed to them as the permanent is opposed to the changing and inconstant.<br>
<br>
One may, I think, without fear of being upset by any future Galtonian circulars, believe that all men must single out from the rest of what they call themselves some central principle of which each would recognize the foregoing to be a fair general description, - accurate enough, at any rate, to denote what is meant, and keep it unconfused with other things. The moment, however, they came to closer quarters with it, trying to define more accurately its precise nature, we should find opinions beginning to diverge. Some would say that it is a simple active substance, the soul, of which they are thus conscious; others, that it is nothing but a fiction, the imaginary being denoted by the pronoun I; and between these extremes of opinion all sorts of intermediaries would be found.<br>
<br>
Later we must ourselves discuss them all, and sufficient to that day will be the evil thereof. Now, let us try to settle for ourselves as definitely as we can, just how this central nucleus of the Self may feel, no matter whether it be a spiritual substance or only a delusive word.<br>
<br>
For this central part of the Self is felt. It may be all that Transcendentalists say it is, and all that Empiricists say it is into the bargain, but it is at any rate no mere ens rationis, cognized only in an intellectual way, and no mere summation of memories or mere sound of a word in our ears. It is something with which we also have direct sensible acquaintance, and which is as fully present at any moment of consciousness in which it is present, as in a whole lifetime of such moments. When, just now, it was called an abstraction, that did not mean that, like some general notion, it could not be presented in a particular experience. It only meant that in the stream of consciousness it never was found all alone. But when it is found, it is felt; just as the body is felt, the feeling of which is also an abstraction, because never is the body felt all alone, but always together with other things. Now can we tell more precisely in what the feeling of this central active self consists, - not necessarily as yet what the active self is, as a being or principle, but what we feel when we become aware of its existence?<br>
<br>
I think I can in my own case; and as what I say will be likely to meet with opposition if generalized (as indeed it may be in part inapplicable to other individuals), I had better continue in the first person, leaving my description to be accepted by those to whose introspection it may commend itself as true, and confessing my inability to meet the demands of others, if others there be.<br>
<br>
First of all, I am aware of a constant play of furtherances and hindrances in my thinking, of checks and releases, tendencies which run with desire, and tendencies which run the other way. Among the matters I think of, some range themselves on the side of the thought's interests, whilst others play an unfriendly part thereto. The mutual inconsistencies and agreements, reinforcements and obstructions, which obtain amonst these objective matters reverberate backwards and produce what seem to be incessant reactions of my spontaneity upon them, welcoming or opposing, appropriating or disowning, striving with or against, saying yes or no. This palpitating inward life is, in me, that central nucleus which I just tried to describe in terms that all men might use. But when I forsake such general descriptions and grap- ple with particulars, coming to the closest possible quarters with the facts, it is difficult for me to detect in the activity any purely spiritual element at all. Whenever my introspective glance succeeds in turning round quickly enough to catch one of these manifestations of spontaneity in the act, all it can ever feel distinctly is some bodily process, for the most part taking place within the head. Omitting for a moment what is obscure in these introspective results, let me try to state those particulars which to my own consciousness seem indubitable and distinct.<br>
<br>
In the first place, the acts of attending, assenting, negating, making an effort, are felt as movements of something in the head. In many cases it is possible to describe these movements quite exactly. In attending to either an idea or a sensation belonging to a particular sense-sphere, the movement is the adjustment of the sense-organ, felt as it occurs. I cannot think in visual terms, for example, without feeling a fluctuating play of pressures, convergences, divergences, and accommodations in my eyeballs. The direction in which the object is conceived to lie determines the character of these movements, the feeling of which becomes, for my consciousness, identified with the manner in which I make myself ready to receive the visible thing. My brain appears to me as if all shot across with lines of direction, of which I have become conscious as my attention has shifted from one sense-organ to another, in passing to successive outer things, or in following trains of varying sense-ideas.<br>
<br>
When I try to remember or reflect, the movements in question, instead of being directed towards the periphery, seem to come from the periphery inwards and feel like a sort of withdrawal from the outer world. As far as I can detect, these feelings are due to an actual rolling outwards and upwards of the eyeballs, such as I believe occurs in me in sleep, and is the exact opposite of their action in fixating a physical thing. In reasoning, I find that I am apt to have a kind of vaguely localized diagram in my mind, with the various fractional objects of the thought disposed at particular points thereof; and the oscillations of my attention from one of them to another are most distinctly felt as alternations of direction in movements occurring inside the head.[4]<br>
<br>
In consenting and negating, and in making a mental effort, the movements seem more complex, and I find them harder to describe. The opening and closing of the glottis play a great part in these operations, and, less distinctly, the movements of the soft palate, etc., shutting off the posterior nares of the mouth. My glottis is like a sensitive valve, intercepting my breath instantaneously at every mental hesitation or felt aversion to the objects of my thought, and as quickly opening, to let the air pass through my throat and nose, the moment the repugnance is overcome. The feeling of the movement of this air is, in me, one strong ingredient of the feeling of assent. The movements of the muscles of the brow and eyelids also respond very sensitively to every fluctuation in the agreeableness or disagreeableness of what comes before my mind.<br>
<br>
In effort of any sort, contractions of the jaw-muscles and of those of respiration are added to those of the brow and glottis, and thus the feeling passes out of the head properly so called. It passes out of the head whenever the welcoming or rejecting of the object is strongly felt. Then a set of feelings pour in from many bodily parts, all 'expressive' of my emotion, and the head-feelings proper are swallowed up in this larger mass.<br>
<br>
In a sense, then, it may be truly said that, in one person at least, the 'Self of selves,' when carefully examined, is found to consist mainly of the collection of these peculiar motions in the head or between the head and throat. I do not for a moment say that this is all it consists of, for I fully realize how desperately hard is introspection in this field. But I feel quite sure that these cephalic motions are the portions of my innermost activity of which I am most distinctly aware. If the dim portions which I cannot yet define should prove to be like unto these distinct portions in me, and I like other men, it would follow that our entire feeling of spiritual activity, or what commonly passes by that name, is really a feeling of bodily activities whose exact nature is by most men overlooked.<br>
<br>
Now, without pledging ourselves in any way to adopt this hypothesis, let us dally with it for a while to see to what consequences it might lead if it were true.<br>
<br>
In the first place, the nuclear part of the Self, intermediary between ideas and overt acts, would be a collection of activities physiologically in no essential way different from the overt acts themselves. If we divide all possible physiological acts into adjustments and executions, the nuclear self would be the adjustments collectively considered; and the less intimate, more shifting self, so far as it was active, would be the executions. But both adjustments and executions would obey the reflex type. Both would be the result of sensorial and ideational processes discharging either into each other within the brain, or into muscles and other parts outside. The peculiarity of the adjustments would be that they are minimal reflexes, few in number, incessantly repeated, constant amid great fluctuations in the rest of the mind's content, and entirely unimportant and uninteresting except through their uses in furthering or inhibiting the presence of various things, and actions before consciousness. These characters would naturally keep us from introspectively paying much attention to them in detail, whilst they would at the same time make us aware of them as a coherent group of processes, strongly contrasted with all the other things consciousness contained, - even with the other constituents of the 'Self,' material, social, or spiritual, as the case might be. They are reactions, and they are primary reactions. Everything arouses them; for objects which have no other effects will for a moment contract the brow and make the glottis close. It is as if all that visited the mind had to stand an entrance-examination, and just show its face so as to be either approved or sent back. These primary reactions are like the opening or the closing of the door. In the midst of psychic change they are the permanent core of turnings-towards and trunings-from, of yieldings and arrests, which naturally seem central and interior in com-parison with the foreign matters, apropos to which they occur, and hold a sort of arbitrating, decisive position, quite unlike that held by any of the other constituents of the Me. It would not be surprising, then, if we were to feel them as the birthplace of conclusions and the starting point of acts, or if they came to appear as what we called a while back the 'sanctuary within the citadel' of our personal life.[5]<br>
<br>
If they really were the innermost sanctuary, the ultimate one of all the selves whose being we can ever directly experience, it would follow that all that is experienced is, strictly considered, objective; that this Objective falls asunder into two contrasted parts, one realized as 'Self,' the other as 'not-Self;' and that over and above these parts there is nothing save the fact that they are known, the fact of the stream of thought being there as the indispensable subjective condition of their being experienced at all. But this condition of the experience is not one of the things experienced at the moment; this knowing is not immediately known. It is only known in subsequent reflection. Instead, then, of the stream of thought being one of con-sciousness, ""thinking its own existence along with whatever else it thinks,"" (as Ferrier says) it might be better called a stream of Sciousness pure and simple, thinking objects of some of which it makes what it calls a 'Me,' and only aware of its 'pure' Self in an abstract, hypothetic or conceptual way. Each 'section' of the stream would then be a bit of sciousness or knowledge of this sort, including and contemplating its 'me' and its 'not-me' as objects which work out their drama together, but not yet including or contemplating its own subjective being. The sciousness in question would be the Thinker, and the existence of this thinker would be given to us rather as a logical postulate than as that direct inner perception of spiritual activity which we naturally believe ourselves to have. 'Matter,' as something behind physical phenomena, is a postulate of this sort. Between the postulated Matter and the postulated Thinker, the sheet of phenomena would then swing, some of them (the 'realities') pertaining more to the matter, others (the fictions, opinions, and errors) pertaining more to the Thinker. But who the Thinker would be, or how many distinct Thinkers we ought to suppose in the universe, would all be subjects for an ulterior metaphysical inquiry.<br>
<br>
Speculations like this traverse common-sense; and not only do they traverse common sense (which in philosophy is no insuperable objection) but they contradict the fundamental assumption of every philosophic school. Spiritualists, transcendentalists, and empiricists alike admit in us a continual direct perception of the thinking activity in the concrete. However they may otherwise disagree, they vie with each other in the cordiality of their recognition of our thoughts as the one sort of existent which skepticism cannot touch.[6] I will therefore treat the last few pages as a parenthetical digression, and from now to the end of the volume revert to the path of common-sense again. I mean by this that I will continue to assume (as I have assumed all along, especially in the last chapter) a direct awareness of the process of our thinking as such, simply insisting on the fact that it is an even more inward and subtle phenomenon than most of us suppose. At the conclusion of the volume, however, I may permit myself to revert again to the doubts here provisionally mooted, and will indulge in some metaphysical reflections suggested by them.<br>
<br>
At present, then, the only conclusion I come to is the following: That (in some persons at least) the part of the innermost Self which is most vividly felt turns out to consist for the most part of a collection of cephalic movements of 'adjustments' which, for want of attention and reflection, usually fail to be perceived and classed as what they are; that over and above these there is an obscurer feeling of something more; but whether it be of fainter physiological processes, or of nothing objective at all, but rather of subjectivity as such, of thought become 'its own object,' must at present remain an open question, - like the question whether it be an indivisible active soul-substance, or the question whether it be a personification of the pronoun I, or any other of the guesses as to what its nature may be.<br>
<br>
Farther than this we cannot as yet go clearly in our analysis of the Self's constituents. So let us proceed to the emotions of Self which they arouse.<br>
<br>
2. Self-Feeling. These are primarily self-complacency and self-dissatisfaction. Of what is called 'self-love,' I will treat a little farther on. Language has synonyms enough for both primary feelings. Thus pride, conceit, vanity, self-esteem, arrogance, vainglory, on the one hand; and on the other modesty, humility, confusion, diffidence, shame, mortification, contrition, the sense of obloquy and personal despair. These two opposite classes of affection seem to be direct and elementary endowments of our nature. Associationists would have it that they are, on the other hand, secondary phenomena arising from a rapid computation of the sensible pleasures or pains to which our prosperous or debased personal predicament is likely to lead, the sum of the represented pleasures forming the self-satisfaction, and the sum of the represented pains forming the opposite feeling of shame. No doubt, when we are self-satisfied, we do fondly rehearse all possible rewards for our desert, and when in a fit of self-despair we forebode evil. But the mere expectation of reward is not the self-satisfaction, and the mere apprehension of the evil is not the self-despair, for there is a certain average tone of self-feeling which each one of us carries about with him, and which is independent of the objective reasons we may have for satisfaction or discontent. That is, a very meanly-conditioned man may abound in unfaltering conceit, and one whose success in life is secure and who is esteemed by all may remain diffident of his powers to the end.<br>
<br>
One may say, however, that the normal provocative of self-feeling is one's actual success or failure, and the good or bad actual position one holds in the world. ""He put in his thumb and pulled out a plum, and said what a good boy am I."" A man with a broadly extended empirical Ego, with powers that have uniformly brought him success, with place and wealth and friends and fame, is not likely to be visited by the morbid diffidences and doubts about himself which he had when he was a boy. ""Is not this great Babylon, which I have planted?""[7] Whereas he who has made one blunder after another, and still lies in middle life among the failures at the foot of the hill, is liable to grow all sicklied o'er with self-distrust, and to shrink from trials with which his powers can really cope.<br>
<br>
The emotions themselves of self-satisfaction and abasement are of a unique sort, each as worthy to be classed as a primitive emotional species as are, for example, rage or pain. Each has its own peculiar physiognomical expression. In self-satisfaction the extensor muscles are innervated, the eye is strong and glorious, the gait rolling and elastic, the nostril dilated, and a peculiar smile plays upon the lips. This whole complex of symptoms is seen in an exquisite way in lunatic asylums, which always contain some patients who are literally mad with conceit, and whose fatuous expression and absurdly strutting or swaggering gait is in tragic contrast with their lack of any valuable personal quality. It is in these same castles of despair that we find the strongest examples of the opposite physiognomy, in good people who think they have committed 'the unpardonable sin' and are lost forever, who crouch and cringe and slink from noticean, d [sic] are unable to speak aloud or look us in the eye. Like fear and like anger, in similar morbid conditions, these opposite feelings of Self may be aroused with no adequate exciting cause. And in fact we ourselves know how the barometer of our self-esteem and confidence rises and falls from one day to another through causes that seem to be visceral and organic rather than rational, and which certainly answer to no corresponding variations in the esteem in which we are held by our friends. Of the origin of these emotions in the race, we can speak better when we have treated of -<br>
<br>
3. Self-Seeking and Self-Preservation. These words cover a large number of our fundamental instinctive impulses. We have those of bodily self-seeking, those of social self-seeking, and those of spiritual self-seeking.<br>
<br>
All the ordinary useful reflex actions and movements of alimentation and defence are acts of bodily self-preservation. Fear and anger prompt to acts that are useful in the same way. Whilst if by self-seeking we mean the providing for the future as distinguished from maintaining the present, we must class both anger and fear with the hunting, the acquisitive, the home-constructing and the tool-constructing instincts, as impulses to self-seeking of the bodily kind. Really, however, these latter instincts, with amativeness, parental fondness, curiosity and emulation, seek not only the development of the bodily Self, but that of the material Self in the widest possible sense of the word.<br>
<br>
Our social self-seeking, in turn, is carried on directly through our amativeness and friendliness, our desire to please and attract notice and admiration, our emulation and jealousy, our love of glory, influence, and power, and indirectly through whichever of the material self-seeking impulses prove serviceable as means to social ends. That the direct social self-seeking impulses are probably pure instincts is easily seen. The noteworthy thing about the desire to be 'recognized' by others is that its strength has so little to do with the worth of the recognition computed in sensational or rational terms. We are crazy to get a visiting-list which shall be large, to be able to say when any one is mentioned, ""Oh! I know him well,"" and to be bowed to in the street by half the people we meet. Of course distinguished friends and admiring recognition are the most desirable - Thackeray somewhere asks his readers to confess whether it would not give each of them an exquisite pleasure to be met walking down Pall Mall with a duke on either arm. But in default of dukes and envious salutations almost anything will do for some of us; and there is a whole race of beings to-day whose passion is to keep their names in the newspapers, no matter under what heading, 'arrivals and departures,' 'personal paragraphs,' 'interviews,' - gossip, even scandal, will suit them if nothing better is to be had. Guiteau, Garfield's assassin, is an example of the extremity to which this sort of craving for the notoriety of print may go in a pathological case. The newspapers bounded his mental horizon; and in the poor wretch's prayer on the scaffold, one of the most heartfelt expressions was: ""The newspaper press of this land has a big bill to settle with thee, O Lord!""<br>
<br>
Not only the people but the places and things I know enlarge my Self in a sort of metaphoric social way. 'Ça me connaît,' as the French workman says of the implement he can use well. So that is comes about that persons for whose opinion we care nothing are nevertheless persons whose notice we woo; and that many a man truly great, many a woman truly fastidious in most respects, will take a deal of trouble to dazzle some insignificant cad whose whole personality they heartily despise.<br>
<br>
Under the head of spiritual self-seeking ought to be included every impulse towards psychic progress, whether intellectual, moral, or spiritual in the narrow sense of the term. It must be admitted, however, that much that commonly passes for spiritual self-seeking in this narrow sense is only material and social self-seeking beyond the grave. In the Mohammedan desire for paradise and the Christian aspiration not to be damned in hell, the materiality of the goods sought is undisguised. In the more positive and refined view of heaven many of its goods, the fellowship of the saints and of our dead ones, and the presence of God, are but social goods of the most exalted kind. It is only the search of the redeemed inward nature, the spotlessness from sin, whether here or hereafter, that can count as spiritual self-seeking pure and undefiled.<br>
<br>
But this broad external review of the facts of the life of the Self will be incomplete without some account of the<br>
<br>
Rivalry and Conflict of the Different Selves. With most objects of desire, physical nature restricts our choice to but one of many represented goods, and even so it is here. I am often confronted by the necessity of standing by one of my empirical selves and relinquishing the rest. Not that I would not, if I could, be both handsome and fat and well dressed, and a great athlete, and make a million a year, be a wit, a bon-vivant, and a lady-killer, as well as a philosopher; a philanthropist, statesman, warrior, and African explorer, as well as a 'tone-poet' and saint. But the thing is simply impossible. The millionaire's work would run counter to the saint's; the bon-vivant and the philanthropist would trip each other up; the philosopher and the lady-killer could not well keep house in the same tenement of clay. Such different characters may conceivably at the outset of life be alike possible to a man. But to make any one of them actual, the rest must more or less be suppressed. So the seeker of his truest, strongest, deepest self must review the list carefully, and pick out the one on which to stake his salvation. All other selves thereupon become unreal, but the fortunes of this self are real. Its failures are real failures, its triumphs real triumphs, carrying shame and gladness with them. This is as strong an example as there is of that selective industry of the mind on which I insisted some pages back (p. 284 ff.). Our thought, incessantly deciding, among many things of a kind, which ones for it shall be realities, here chooses one of many possible selves or characters, and forthwith reckons it no shame to fail in any of those not adopted expressly as its own.<br>
<br>
I, who for the time have staked my all on being a psychologist, am mortified if others know much more psychology than I. But I am contented to wallow in the grossest ignorance of Greek. My deficiencies there give me no sense of personal humiliation at all. Had I 'pretensions' to be a linguist, it would have been just the reverse. So we have the paradox of a man shamed to death because he is only the second pugilist or the second oarsman in the world. That he is able to beat the whole population of the globe minus one is nothing; he has 'pitted' himself to beat that one; and as long as he doesn't do that nothing else counts. He is to his own regard as if he were not, indeed he is not.<br>
<br>
Yonder puny fellow, however, whom every one can beat, suffers no chagrin about it, for he has long ago abandoned the attempt to 'carry that line,' as the merchants say, of self at all. With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-feeling in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do. It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities; a fraction of which our pretensions are the denominator and the numerator our success: thus, Self-esteem = Success / Pretensions. Such a fraction may be increased as well by diminishing the denominator as by increasing the numerator.[8] To give up pretensions is as blessed a relief as to get them gratified; and where disappointment is incessant and the struggle unending, this is what men will always do. The history of evangelical theology, with its conviction of sin, its self-despair, and its abandonment of salvation by works, is the deepest of possible examples, but we meet others in every walk of life. There is the strangest lightness about the heart when one's nothingness in a particular line is once accepted in good faith. All is not bitterness in the lot of the lover sent away by the final inexorable 'No.' Many Bostonians, crede experto (and inhabitants of other cities, too, I fear), would be happier women and men to-day, if they could once for all abandon the notion of keeping up a Musical Self, and without shame let people hear them call a symphony a nuisance. How pleasant is the day when we give up striving to be young, - or slender! Thank God! we say, those illusions are gone. Everything added to the Self is a burden as well as a pride. A certain man who lost every penny during our civil war went and actually rolled in the dust, saying he had not felt so free and happy since he was born.<br>
<br>
Once more, then, our self-feeling is in our power. As Carlyle says: ""Make thy claim of wages a zero, then hast thou the world under thy feet. Well did the wisest of our time write, it is only with renunciation that life, properly speaking, can be said to begin.""<br>
<br>
Neither threats nor pleadings can move a man unless they touch some one of his potential or actual selves. Only thus can we, as a rule, get a 'purchase' on another's will. The first care of diplomatists and monarchs and all who wish to rule or influence is, accordingly, to find out their victim's strongest principle of self-regard, so as to make that the fulcrum of all appeals. But if a man has given up those things which are subject to foreign fate, and ceased to regard them as parts of himself at all, we are well-nigh powerless over him. The Stoic receipt for contentment was to dispossess yourself in advance of all that was out of your own power, - then fortune's shocks might rain down unfelt. Epictetus exhorts us, by thus narrowing and at the same time solidifying our Self to make it invulnerable: ""I must die; well, but must I die groaning too? I will speak what appears to be right, and if the despot says, then I will put you to death, I will reply, 'When did I ever tell you that I was immortal? You will do your part and I mine; it is yours to kill and mine to die intrepid; yours to banish, mine to depart untroubled.' How do we act in a voyage? We choose the pilot, the sailors, the hour. Afterwards comes a storm. What have I to care for? My part is performed. This matter belongs to the pilot. But the ship is sinking; what then have I to do? That which alone I can do - submit to being drowned without fear, without clamor or accusing of God, but as one who knows that what is born must likewise die.""[9]<br>
<br>
This Stoic fashion, though efficacious and heroic enough in its place and time, is, it must be confessed, only possible as an habitual mood of the soul to narrow and unsympathetic characters. It proceeds altogether by exclusion. If I am a Stoic, the goods I cannot appropriate cease to be my goods, and the temptation lies very near to deny that they are goods at all. We find this mode of protecting the Self by exclusion and denial very common among people who are in other respects not Stoics. All narrow people intrench their Me, they retract it, - from the region of what they cannot securely possess. People who don't resemble them, or who treat them with indifference, people over whom they gain no influence, are people on whose existence, however meritorious it may intrinsically be, they look with chill negation, if not with positive hate. Who will not be mine I will exclude from existence altogether; that is, as far as I can make it so, such people shall be as if they were not.[10] Thus may a certain absoluteness and definiteness in the outline of my Me console me for the smallness of its content.<br>
<br>
Sympathetic people, on the contrary, proceed by the entirely opposite way of expansion and inclusion. The outline of their self often gets uncertain enough, but for this the spread of its content more than atones. Nil humani a me alienum. Let them despise this little person of mine, and treat me like a dog, I shall not negate them so long as I have a soul in my body. They are realities as much as I am. What positive good is in them shall be mine too, etc., etc. The magnanimity of these expansive natures is often touching indeed. Such persons can feel a sort of delicate rapture in thinking that, however sick, ill-favored, mean-conditioned, and generally forsaken they may be, they yet are integral parts of the whole of this brave world, have a fellow's share in the strength of the dray-horses, the happiness of the young people, the wisdom of the wise ones, and are not altogether without part or lot in the good fortunes of the Vanderbilts and the Hohenzollerns themselves. Thus either by negating or by embracing, the Ego may seek to establish itself in reality. He who, with Marcus Aurelius, can truly say, ""O Universe, I wish all that thou wishest,"" has a self from which every trace of negativeness and obstructiveness has been removed - no wind can blow except to fill its sails.<br>
<br>
A tolerably unanimous opinion ranges the different selves of which a man may be 'seized and possessed,' and the consequent different orders of his self-regard, in an hierarchical scale, with the bodily Self at the bottom, the spiritual Self at the top, and the extracorporeal material selves and the various social selves between. Our merely natural self-seeking would lead us to aggrandize all these selves; we give up deliberately only those among them which we find we cannot keep. Our unselfishness is thus apt to be a 'virtue of necessity'; and it is not without all show of reason that cynics quote the fable of the fox and the grapes in describing our progress therein. But this is the moral education of the race; and if we agree in the result that on the whole the selves we can keep are the intrinsically best, we need not complain of being led to the knowledge of their superior worth in such a tortuous way.<br>
<br>
Of course this is not the only way in which we learn to subordinate our lower selves to our higher. A direct ethical judgment unquestionably also plays its part, and last, not least, we apply to our own persons judgments originally called forth by the acts of others. It is one of the strangest laws of our nature that many things which we are well satisfied with in ourselves disgust us when seen in others. With another man's bodily 'hoggishness' hardly anyone has any sympathy; - almost as little with his cupidity, his social vanity and eagerness, his jealousy, his despotism, and his pride. Left absolutely to myself I should probably allow all these spontaneous tendencies to luxuriate in me unchecked, and it would be long before I formed a distinct notion of the order of their subordination. But having constantly to pass judgment on my associates, I come ere long to see, as Herr Horwicz says, my own lusts in the mirror of the lusts of others, and to think about them in a very different way from that in which I simply feel. Of course, the moral generalities which from childhood have been instilled into me accelerate enormously the advent of this reflective judgment on myself.<br>
<br>
So it comes to pass that, as aforesaid, men have arranged the various selves which they may seek in an hierarchical scale according to their worth. A certain amount of bodily selfishness is required as a basis for all the other selves. But too much sensuality is despised, or at best condoned on account of the other qualities of the individual. The wider material selves are regarded as higher than the immediate body. He is esteemed a poor creature who is unable to forego a little meat and drink and warmth and sleep for the sake of getting on in the world. The social self as a whole, again, ranks higher than the material self as a whole. We must care more for our honor, our friends, our human ties, than for a sound skin or wealth. And the spiritual self is so supremely precious that, rather than lose it, a man ought to be willing to give up friends and good fame, and property, and life itself.<br>
<br>
In each kind of self, material, social, and spiritual, men distinguish between the immediate and actual, and the remote and potential, between the narrower and the wider view, to the detriment of the former and advantage of the latter. One must forego a present bodily enjoyment for the sake of one's general health; one must abandon the dollar in the hand for the sake of the hundred dollars to come; one must make an enemy of his present interlocutor if thereby one makes friends of a more valued circle; one must go without learning and grace, and wit, the better to compass one's soul's salvation.<br>
<br>
Of all these wider, more potential selves, the potential social self is the most interesting, by reason of certain apparent paradoxes to which it leads in conduct, and by reason of its connection with our moral and religious life. When for motives of honor and conscience I brave the condemnation of my own family, club, and 'set'; when, as a protestant, I turn catholic; as a catholic, freethinker; as a 'regular practitioner,' homoeopath, or what not, I am always inwardly strengthened in my course and steeled against the loss of my actual social self by the thought of other and better possible social judges than those whose verdict goes against me now. The ideal social self which I thus seek in appealing to their decision may be very remote: it may be represented as barely possible. I may not hope for its realization during my lifetime; I may even expect the future generations, which would approve me if they knew me, to know nothing about me when I am dead and gone. Yet still the emotion that beckons me on is indubitably the pursuit of an ideal social self, of a self that is at least worthy of approving recognition by the highest possible judging companion, if such companion there be.[11] This self is the true, the intimate, the ultimate, the permanent Me which I seek. This judge is God, the Absolute Mind, the 'Great Companion.' We hear, in these days of scientific enlightenment, a great deal of discussion about the efficacy of prayer; and many reasons are given us why we should not pray, whilst others are given us why we should. But in all this very little is said of the reason why we do pray, which is simply that we cannot help praying. It seems probable that, in spite of all that 'science' may do to the contrary, men will continue to pray to the end of time, unless their mental nature changes in a manner which nothing we know should lead us to expect. The impulse to pray is a necessary consequence of the fact that whilst the innermost of the empirical selves of a man is a Self of the social sort, it yet can find its only adequate Socius in an ideal world.<br>
<br>
All progress in the social Self is the substitution of higher tribunals for lower; this ideal tribunal is the highest; and most men, either continually or occasionally, carry a reference to it in their breast. The humblest outcast on this earth can feel himself to be real and valid by means of this higher recognition. And, on the other hand, for most of us, a world with no such inner refuge when the outer social self failed and dropped from us would be the abyss of horror. I say 'for most of us,' because it is probable that individuals differ a good deal in the degree in which they are haunted by this sense of an ideal spectator. It is a much more essential part of the consciousness of some men that of others. Those who have the most of it are possibly the most religious men. But I am sure that even those who say they are altogether without it deceive themselves, and really have it in some degree. Only a non-gregarious animal could be completely without it. Probably no one can make sacrifices for 'right,' without to some degree personifying the principle of right for which the sacrifice is made, and expecting thanks from it. Complete social unselfishness, in other words, can hardly exist; complete social suicide hardly occur to a man's mind. Even such texts as Job's, ""Though He slay me yet will I trust Him,"" or Marcus Aurelius's, ""If gods hate me and my children, there is a reason for it,"" can least of all be cited to prove the contrary. For beyond all doubt Job revelled in the thought of Jehovah's recognition of the worship after the slaying should have been done; and the Roman emperor felt sure the Absolute Reason would not be all indifferent to his acquiescence in the gods' dislike. The old test of piety, ""Are you willing to be damned for the glory of God?"" was probably never answered in the affirmative except by those who felt sure in their heart of hearts that God would 'credit' them with their willingness, and set more store by them thus than if in His unfathomable scheme He had not damned them at all.<br>
<br>
All this about the impossibility of suicide is said on the supposition of positive motives. When possessed by the emotion of fear, however, we are in a negative state of mind; that is, our desire is limited to the mere banishing of something, without regard to what shall take its place. In this state of mind there can unquestionably be genuine thoughts, and genuine acts, of suicide, spiritual and social, as well as bodily. Anything, anything, at such times, so as to escape and not to be! But such conditions of suicidal frenzy are pathological in their nature and run dead against everything that is regular in the life of the Self in man.<br>
<br>
What Self is Loved in 'Self-Love'? We must now try to interpret the facts of self-love and self-seeking a little more delicately from within.<br>
<br>
A man in whom self-seeking of any sort is largely developed is said to be selfish.[12] He is on the other hand called unselfish if he shows consideration for the interest of other selves than his own. Now what is the intimate nature of the selfish emotion in him? and what is the primary object of its regard? We have described him pursuing and fostering as his self first one set of things and then another: we have seen the same set of facts gain or lose interest in his eyes, leave him indifferent, or fill him either with triumph or despair according as he made pretensions to appropriate them, treated them as if they were potentially or actually parts of himself, or not. We know how little it matters to us whether some man, a man taken at large and in the abstract, prove a failure or succeed in life, - he may be hanged for aught we care, - but we know the utter momentousness and terribleness of the alternative when the man is the one whose name we ourselves bear. I must not be a failure, is the very loudest of the voices that clamor in each of our breasts: let fail who may, I at least must succeed. Now the first conclusion which these facts suggest is that each of us is animated by a direct feeling of regard for his own pure principle of individual existence, whatever that may be, taken merely as such. It appears as if all our concrete manifestations of selfishness might be the conclusions of as many syllogisms, each with this principle as the subject of its major premiss, thus: Whatever is me is precious; this is me; therefore this is precious; whatever is mine must not fail; this is mine; therefore this must not fail, etc. It appears, I say, as if this principle inoculated all it touched with its own intimate quality of worth; as if, previous to the touching, everything might be matter of indifference, and nothing interesting in its own right; as if my regard for my own body even were an interest not simply in this body, but in this body only so far as it is mine.<br>
<br>
But what is this abstract numerical principle of identity, this 'Number One' within me, for which, according to proverbial philosophy, I am supposed to keep so constant a 'lookout'? Is it the inner nucleus of my spiritual self, that collection of obscurely felt 'adjustments,' plus perhaps that still more obscurely perceived subjectivity as such, of which we recently spoke? Or is it perhaps the concrete stream of my thought in its entirety, or some one section of the same? Or may it be the indivisible Soul-Substance, in which, according to the orthodox tradition, my faculties inhere? Or, finally, can it be the mere pronoun I? Surely it is none of these things, that self for which I feel such hot regard. Though all of them together were put within me, I should still be cold, and fail to exhibit anything worthy of the name of selfishness or of devotion to 'Number One.' To have a self that I can care for, nature must first present me with some object interesting enough to make me instinctively wish to appropriate it for its own sake, and out of it to manufacture one of those material, social, or spiritual selves, which we have already passed in review. We shall find that all the facts of rivalry and substitution that have so struck us, all the shiftings and expansions and contractions of the sphere of what shall be considered me and mine, are but results of the fact that certain things appeal to primitive and instinctive impulses of our nature, and that we follow their destinies with an excitement that owes nothing to a reflective source. These objects our consciousness treats as the primordial constituents of its Me. Whatever other objects, whether by association with the fate of these, or in any other way, come to be followed with the same sort of interest, form our remoter and more secondary self. The words ME, then, and SELF, so far as they arouse feeling and connote emotional worth, are OBJECTIVE designations, meaning ALL THE THINGS which have the power to produce in a stream of consciousness excitement of a certain peculiar sort. Let us try to justify this proposition in detail.<br>
<br>
The most palpable selfishness of a man is his bodily selfishness; and his most palpable self is the body to which that selfishness relates. Now I say that he identifies himself with this body because he loves it, and that he does not love it because he finds it to be identified with himself. Reverting to natural history-psychology will help us to see the truth of this. In the chapter on Instincts we shall learn that every creature has a certain selective interest in certain portions of the world, and that this interest is as often connate as acquired. Our interest in things means the attention and emotion which the thought of them will excite, and the actions which their presence will evoke. Thus every species is particularly interested in its own prey or food, its own enemies, its own sexual mates, and its own young. These things fascinate by their intrinsic power to do so; they are cared for for their own sakes.<br>
<br>
Well, it stands not in the least otherwise with our bodies. They too are percepts in our objective field - they are simply the most interesting percepts there. What happens to them excites in us emotions and tendencies to action more energetic and habitual than any which are excited by other portions of the 'field.' What my comrades call my bodily selfishness or self-love, is nothing but the sum of all the outer acts which this interest in my body spontaneously draws from me. My 'selfishness' is here but a descriptive name for grouping together the outward symptoms which I show. When I am led by self-love to keep my seat whilst ladies stand, or to grab something first and cut out my neighbor, what I really love is the comfortable seat, is the thing itself which I grab. I love them primarily, as the mother loves her babe, or a generous man an heroic deed. Wherever, as here, self-seeking is the outcome of simple instinctive propensity, it is but a name for certain reflex acts. Something rivets my attention fatally, and fatally provokes the 'selfish' response. Could an automaton be so skilfully constructed as to ape these acts, it would be called selfish as properly as I. It is true that I am no automaton, but a thinker. But my thoughts, like my acts, are here concerned only with the outward things. They need neither know nor care for any pure principle within. In fact the more utterly 'selfish' I am in this primitive way, the more blindly absorbed my thought will be in the objects and impulses of my lusts, and the more devoid of any inward looking glance. A baby, whose con- sciousness of the pure Ego, of himself as a thinker, is not usually supposed developed, is, in this way, as some German has said, 'der vollendeteste Egoist.' His corporeal person, and what ministers to its needs, are the only self he can possibly be said to love. His so-called self-love is but a name for his insensibility to all but this one set of things. It may be that he needs a pure principle of subjectivity, a soul or pure Ego (he certainly needs a stream of thought) to make him sensible at all to anything, to make him discriminate and love uberhaupt, - how that may be, we shall see ere long; but this pure Ego, which would then be the condition of his loving, need no more be the object of his love than it need be the object of his thought. If his interests were altruistic and all his acts suicidal, still he would need a principle of consciousness just as he does now. Such a principle cannot then be the principle of his bodily selfishness any more than it is the principle of any other tendency he may show.<br>
<br>
So much for the bodily self-love. But my social self-love, my interest in the images other men have framed of me, is also an interest in a set of objects external to my thought. These thoughts in other men's minds are out of my mind and 'ejective' to me. They come and go, and grow and dwindle, and I am puffed up with pride, or blush with shame, at the result, just as at my success or failure in the pursuit of a material thing. So that here again, just as in the former case, the pure principle seems out of the game as an object of regard, and present only as the general form or condition under which the regard and the thinking go on in me at all.<br>
<br>
But, it will immediately be objected, this is giving a mutilated account of the facts. Those images of me in the minds of other men are, it is true, things outside of me, whose changes I perceive just as I perceive any other outward change. But the pride and shame which I feel are not concerned merely with those changes. I feel as if something else had changed too, when I perceived my image in your mind to have changed for the worse, something in me to which that image belongs, and which a moment ago I felt inside of me, big and strong and lusty, but now weak, contracted, and collapsed. Is not this latter change the change I feel the shame about? Is not the condition of this thing inside of me the proper object of my egoistic concern, of my self-regard? And is it not, after all, my pure Ego, my bare numerical principle of distinction from other men, and no empirical part of me at all?<br>
<br>
No, it is no such pure principle, it is simply my total empirical selfhood again, my historic Me, a collection of objective facts, to which the depreciated image in your mind 'belongs.' In what capacity is it that I claim and demand a respectful greeting from you instead of this expression of disdain? It is not as being a bare I that I claim it; it is as being an I who has always been treated with respect, who belongs to a certain family and 'set,' who has certain powers, possessions, and public functions, sensibilities, duties, and purposes, and merits and deserts. All this is what your disdain negates and contradicts; this is 'the thing inside of me' whose changed treatment I feel the shame about; this is what was lusty, and now, in consequence of your conduct, is collapsed; and this certainly is an empirical objective thing. Indeed, the thing that is felt modified and changed for the worse during my feeling of shame is often more concrete even than this, - it is simply my bodily person, in which your conduct immediately and without any reflection at all on my part works those muscular, glandular, and vascular changes which together make up the 'expression' of shame. In this instinctive, reflex sort of shame, the body is just as much the entire vehicle of the self-feeling as, in the coarser cases which we first took up, it was the vehicle of the self-seeking. As, in simple 'hoggishness,' a succulent morsel gives rise, by the reflex mechanism, to behavior which the bystanders find 'greedy,' and consider to flow from a certain sort of 'self-regard;' so here your disdain gives rise, by a mechanism quite as reflex and immediate, to another sort of behavior, which the bystanders call 'shame-faced' and which they consider due to another kind of self-regard. But in both cases there may be no particular self regarded at all by the mind; and the name self-regard may be only a descriptive title imposed from without the reflex acts themselves, and the feelings that immediately result from their discharge.<br>
<br>
After the bodily and social selves come the spiritual. But which of my spiritual selves do I really care for? My Soul-substance? my 'transcendental Ego, or Thinker'? my pronoun I? my subjectivity as such? my nucleus of cephalic adjustments? or my more phenomenal and perishable powers, my loves and hates, willingnesses and sensibilities, and the like? Surely the latter. But they, relatively to the central principle, whatever it may be, are external and objective. They come and go, and it remains - ""so shakes the magnet, and so stands the pole."" It may indeed have to be there for them to be loved, but being there is not identical with being loved itself.<br>
<br>
To sum up, then, we see no reason to suppose that self-love' is primarily, or secondarily, or ever, love for one's mere principle of conscious identity. It is always love for something which, as compared with that principle, is superficial, transient, liable to be taken up or dropped at will.<br>
<br>
And zoological psychology again comes to the aid of our understanding and shows us that this must needs be so. In fact, in answering the question what things it is that a man loves in his self-love, we have implicitly answered the farther question, of why he loves them.<br>
<br>
Unless his consciousness were something more than cognitive, unless it experienced a partiality for certain of the objects, which, in succession, occupy its ken, it could not long maintain itself in existence; for, by an inscrutable necessity, each human mind's appearance on this earth is conditioned upon the integrity of the body with which it belongs, upon the treatment which that body gets from others, and upon the spiritual dispositions which use it as their tool, and lead it either towards longevity or to destruction. Its own body, then, first of all, its friends next, and finally its spiritual dispositions, MUST be the supremely interesting OBJECTS for each human mind. Each mind, to begin with, must have a certain minimum of selfishness in the shape of instincts of bodily self-seeking in order to exist. This minimum must be there as a basis for all farther conscious acts, whether of self-negation or of a selfishness more subtle still. All minds must have come, by the way of survival of the fittest, if by no director path, to take an intense interest in the bodies to which they are yoked, altogether apart from any interest in the pure Ego which they also possess.<br>
<br>
And similarly with the images of their person in the minds of others. I should not be extant now had I not become sensitive to looks of approval or disapproval on the faces among which my life is cast. Looks of contempt cast on other persons need affect me in no such peculiar way. Were my mental life dependent exclusively on some other person's welfare, either directly or in an indirect way, then natural selection would unquestionably have brought it about that I should be as sensitive to the social vicissitudes of that other person as I now am to my own. Instead of being egoistic I should be spontaneously altruistic, then. But in this case, only partially realized in actual human conditions, though the self I empirically love would have changed, my pure Ego or Thinker would have to remain just what it is now.<br>
<br>
My spiritual powers, again, must interest me more than those of other people, and for the same reason. I should not be here at all unless I had cultivated them and kept them from decay. And the same law which made me once care for them makes me care for them still.<br>
<br>
My own body and what ministers to its needs are thus the primitive object, instinctively determined, of my egoistic interests. Other objects may become interesting derivatively through association with any of these things, either as means or as habitual concomitants; and so in a thousand ways the primitive sphere of the egoistic emotions may enlarge and change its boundaries.<br>
<br>
This sort of interest is really the meaning of the word 'my.' Whatever has it is eo ipso a part of me. My child, my friend dies, and where he goes I feel that part of myself now is and evermore shall be:<br>
<br>
""For this losing is true dying; This is lordly man's down-lying; This his slow but sure reclining, Star by star his world resigning."" The fact remains, however, that certain special sorts of thing tend primordially to possess this interest, and form the natural me. But all these things are objects, properly so called, to the subject which does the thinking.[13] And this latter fact upsets at once the dictum of the old-fashioned sensationalist psychology, that altruistic passions and interests are contradictory to the nature of things, and that if they appear anywhere to exist, it must be as secondary products, resolvable at bottom into cases of selfishness, taught by experience a hypocritical disguise. If the zoological and evolutionary point of view is the true one, there is no reason why any object whatever might not arouse passion and interest as primitively and instinctively as any other, whether connected or not with the interests of the me. The phenomenon of passion is in origin and essence the same, whatever be the target upon which it is discharged; and what the target actually happens to be is solely a question of fact. I might conceivably be as much fascinated, and as primitively so, by the care of my neighbor's body as by the care of my own. The only check to such exuberant altruistic interests is natural selection, which would weed out such as were very harmful to the individual or to his tribe. Many such interests, however, remain unweeded out - the interest in the opposite sex, for example, which seems in mankind stronger than is called for by its utilitarian need; and alongside of them remain interests, like that in alcoholic intoxication, or in musical sounds, which, for aught we can see, are without any utility whatever. The sympathetic instincts and the egoistic ones are thus co-ordinate. They arise, so far as we can tell, on the same psychologic level. The only difference between them is, that the instincts called egoistic form much the larger mass.<br>
<br>
The only author whom I know to have discussed the question whether the 'pure Ego,' per se, can be an object of regard, is Herr Horwicz, in his extremely able and acute Psychologische Analysen. He too says that all self-regard is regard for certain objective things. He disposes so well of one kind of objection that I must conclude by quoting a part of his own words:<br>
<br>
First, the objection:<br>
<br>
""The fact is indubitable that one's own children always pass for the prettiest and brightest, the wine from one's own cellar for the best - at least for its price, - one's own house and horses for the finest. With what tender admiration do we con over our own little deed of benevolence! our own frailties and misdemeanors, how ready we are to acquit ourselves for them, when we notice them at all, on the ground of 'extenuating circumstances'! How much more really comic are our own jokes than those of others, which, unlike ours, will not bear being repeated ten or twelve times over! How eloquent, striking, powerful, our own speeches are! How appropriate our own address! In short, how much more intelligent, soulful, better, is everything about us than in anyone else. The sad chapter of artists' and authors' conceit and vanity belongs here.<br>
<br>
""The prevalence of this obvious preference which we feel for everything of our own is indeed striking. Does it not look as if our dear Ego must first lend its color and flavor to anything in order to make it please us?... Is it not the simplest explanation for all these phenomena, so consistent among themselves, to suppose that the Ego, the self, which forms the origin and centre of our thinking life, is at the same time the original and central object of our life of feeling, and the ground both of whatever special ideas and of whatever special feelings ensue?""<br>
<br>
Herr Horwicz goes on to refer to what we have already noticed, that various things which disgust us in others do not disgust us at all in ourselves.<br>
<br>
""To most of us even the bodily warmth of another, for example the chair warm from another's sitting, is felt unpleasantly, whereas there is nothing disagreeable in the warmth of the chair in which we have been sitting ourselves.""<br>
<br>
After some further remarks, he replies to these facts and reasonings as follows:<br>
<br>
""We may with confidence affirm that our own possessions in most cases please us better [not because they are ours], but simply because we know them better, 'realize' them more intimately, feel them more deeply. We learn to appreciate what is ours in all its details and shadings, whilst the goods of others appear to us in coarse outlines and rude averages. Here are some examples: A piece of music which one plays one's self is heard and understood better than when it is played by another. We get more exactly all the details, penetrate more deeply into the musical thought. We may meanwhile perceive perfectly well that the other person is the better performer, and yet nevertheless - at times get more enjoyment from our own playing because it brings the melody and harmony so much nearer home to us. This case may almost be taken as typical for the other cases of self-love. On close examination, we shall almost always find that a great part of our feeling about what is ours is due to the fact that we live closer to our own things, and so feel them more thoroughly and deeply. As a friend of mine was about to marry, he often bored me by the repeated and minute way in which he would discuss the details of his new household arrangements. I wondered that so intellectual a man should be so deeply interested in things of so external a nature. But as I entered, a few years later, the same condition myself, these matters acquired for me an entirely different interest, and it became my turn to turn them over and talk of them unceasingly.... The reason was simply this, that in the first instance I understood nothing of these things and their importance for domestic comfort, whilst in the latter case they came home to me with irresistible urgency, and vividly took possession of my fancy. So it is with many a one who mocks at decorations and titles, until he gains one himself. And this is also surely the reason why one's own portrait or reflection in the mirror is so peculiarly interesting a thing to contemplate... not on account of any absolute 'c'est moi,' but just as with the music played by ourselves. What greets our eyes is what we know best, most deeply understand; because we ourselves have felt it and lived through it. We know what has ploughed these furrows, deepened these shadows, blanched this hair; and other faces may be handsomer, but none can speak to us or interest us like this.""[14]<br>
<br>
Moreover, this author goes on to show that our own things are fuller for us than those of others because of the memories they awaken and the practical hopes and expectations they arouse. This alone would emphasize them, apart from any value derived from their belonging to ourselves. We may conclude with him, then, that an original central self-feeling can never explain the passionate warmth of our self-regarding emotions, which must, on the contrary, be addressed directly to special things less abstract and empty of content. To these things the name of 'self' may be given, or to our conduct towards them the name of 'selfishness,' but neither in the self nor the selfishness does the pure Thinker play the 'title-rôle.'<br>
<br>
Only one more point connected with our self-regard need be mentioned. We have spoken of it so far as active instinct or emotion. It remains to speak of it as cold intellectual self-estimation. We may weigh our own Me in the balance of praise and blame as easily as we weigh other people, - though with difficulty quite as fairly. The just man is the one who can weigh himself impartially. Impartial weighing presupposes a rare faculty of abstraction from the vividness with which, as Herr Horwicz has pointed out, things known as intimately as our own possessions and performances appeal to our imagination; and an equally rare power of vividly representing the affairs of others. But, granting these rare powers, there is no reason why a man should not pass judgment on himself quite as objectively and well as on anyone else. No matter how he feels about himself, unduly elated or unduly depressed, he may still truly know his own worth by measuring it by the outward standard he applies to other men, and counteract the injustice of the feeling he cannot wholly escape. This self-measuring process has nothing to do with the instinctive self-regard we have hitherto been dealing with. Being merely one application of intellectual comparison, it need no longer detain us here. Please note again, however, how the pure Ego appears merely as the vehicle in which the estimation is carried on, the objects estimated being all of them facts of an empirical sort,[15] one's body, one's credit, one's fame, one's intellectual ability, one's goodness, or whatever the case may be.<br>
<br>
The empirical life of Self is divided, as below, into<br>
<br>
Material. Social. Spiritual. Self-Seeking. Bodily Appetites and Instincts Love of Adornment, Foppery, Acquisitiveness, Constructiveness Love of Home, etc. Desire to please, be noticed, admired, etc. Sociability, Emulation, Envy, Love, Pursuit of Honor, Ambition, etc. Intellectual, Moral and Reli - gious Aspiration, Conscientiousness Self-Estimation Personal Vanity, Modesty, etc. Pride of Wealth, Fear of Poverty Social and Family Pride, Vainglory, Snobbery, Humility, Shame, etc. Sense of Moral or Mental Superiority, Purity, etc. Sense of Inferiority or of Guilt<br>
<br>
The Pure Ego.<br>
<br>
Having summed up in the above table the principal results of the chapter thus far, I have said all that need be said of the constituents of the phenomenal self, and of the nature of self-regard. Our decks are consequently cleared for the struggle with that pure principle of personal identity which has met us all along our preliminary exposition, but which we have always shied from and treated as a difficulty to be postponed. Ever since Hume's time, it has been justly regarded as the most puzzling puzzle with which psychology has to deal; and whatever view one may espouse, one has to hold his position against heavy odds. If, with the Spiritualists, one contend for a substantial soul, or transcendental principle of unity, one can give no positive account of what that may be. And if, with the Humians, one deny such a principle and say that the stream of passing thoughts is all, one runs against the entire common-sense of mankind, of which the belief in a distinct principle of selfhood seems an integral part. Whatever solution be adopted in the pages to come, we may as well make up our minds in advance that it will fail to satisfy the majority of those to whom it is addressed. The best way of approaching the matter will be to take up first -<br>
<br>
The Sense of Personal Identity. In the last chapter it was stated in as radical a way as possible that the thoughts which we actually know to exist do not fly about loose, but seem each to belong to some one thinker and not to another. Each thought, out of a multitude of other thoughts of which it may think, is able to distinguish those which belong to its own Ego from those which do not. The former have a warmth and intimacy about them of which the latter are completely devoid, being merely conceived, in a cold and foreign fashion, and not appearing as blood-relatives, bringing their greetings to us from out of the past.<br>
<br>
Now this consciousness of personal sameness may be treated either as a subjective phenomenon or as an objective deliverance, as a feeling, or as a truth. We may explain how one bit of thought can come to judge other bits to belong to the same Ego with itself; or we may criticise its judgment and decide how far it may tally with the nature of things.<br>
<br>
As a mere subjective phenomenon the judgment presents no difficulty or mystery peculiar to itself. It belongs to the great class of judgments of sameness; and there is nothing more remarkable in making a judgment of sameness in the first person than in the second or the third. The intellectual operations seem essentially alike, whether I say 'I am the same,' or whether I say 'the pen is the same, as yesterday.' It is as easy to think this as to think the opposite and say 'neither I nor the pen is the same.'<br>
<br>
This sort of bringing of things together into the object of a single judgment is of course essential to all thinking. The things are conjoined in the thought, whatever may be the relation in which they appear to the thought. The thinking them is thinking them together, even if only with the result of judging that they do not belong together. This sort of subjective synthesis, essential to knowledge as such (whenever it has a complex object), must not be confounded with objective synthesis or union instead of difference or disconnection, known among the things.[16] The subjective syn- thesis is involved in thought's mere existence. Even a really disconnected world could only be known to be such by having its parts temporarily united in the Object of some pulse of consciousness.[17]<br>
<br>
The sense of personal identity is not, then, this mere synthetic form essential to all thought. It is the sense of a sameness perceived by thought and predicated of things thought-about. These things are a present self and a self of yesterday. The thought not only thinks them both, but thinks that they are identical. The psychologist, looking on and playing the critic, might prove the thought wrong, and show there was no real identity, - there might have been no yesterday, or, at any rate, no self of yesterday; or, if there were, the sameness predicated might not obtain, or might be predicated on insufficient grounds. In either case the personal identity would not exist as a fact; but it would exist as a feeling all the same; the consciousness of it by the thought would be there, and the psychologist would still have to analyze that, and show where its illusoriness lay. Let us now be the psychologist and see whether it be right or wrong when it says, I am the same self that I was yesterday.<br>
<br>
We may immediately call it right and intelligible so far as it posits a past time with past thoughts or selves contained therein - these were data which we assumed at the outset of the book. Right also and intelligible so far as it thinks of a present self - that present self we have just studied in its various forms. The only question for us is as to what the consciousness may mean when it calls the present self the same with one of the past selves which it has in mind.<br>
<br>
We spoke a moment since of warmth and intimacy. This leads us to the answer sought. For, whatever the thought we are criticising may think about its present self, that self comes to its acquaintance, or is actually felt, with warmth and intimacy. Of course this is the case with the bodily part of it; we feel the whole cubic mass of our body all the while, it gives us an unceasing sense of personal existence. Equally do we feel the inner 'nucleus of the spiritual self,' either in the shape of yon faint physiological adjustments, or (adopting the universal psychological belief), in that of the pure activity of our thought taking place as such. Our remoter spiritual, material, and social selves, so far as they are realized, come also with a glow and a warmth; for the thought of them infallibly brings some degree of organic emotion in the shape of quickened heart-beats, oppressed breathing, or some other alteration, even though it be a slight one, in the general bodily tone. The character of 'warmth,' then, in the present self, reduces itself to either of two things, - something in the feeling which we have of the thought itself, as thinking, or else the feeling of the body's actual existence at the moment, - or finally to both. We cannot realize our present self without simultaneously feeling one or other of these two things. Any other fact which brings these two things with it into consciousness will be thought with a warmth and an intimacy like those which cling to the present self.<br>
<br>
Any distinct self which fulfills this condition will be thought with such warmth and intimacy. But which distant selves do fulfil the condition, when represented?<br>
<br>
Obviously those, and only those, which fulfilled it when they were alive. Them we shall imagine with the animal warmth upon them, to them may possibly cling the aroma, the echo of the thinking taken in the act. And by a natural consequence, we shall assimilate them to each other and to the warm and intimate self we now feel within us as we think, and separate them as a collection from whatever selves have not this mark, much as out of a herd of cattle let loose for the winter on some wide western prairie the owner picks out and sorts together when the time for the round-up comes in the spring, all the beasts on which he finds his own particular brand.<br>
<br>
The various members of the collection thus set apart are felt to belong with each other whenever they are thought at all. The animal warmth, etc., is their herd-mark, the brand from which they can never more escape. It runs through them all like a thread through a chaplet and makes them into a whole, which we treat as a unit, no matter how much in other ways the parts may differ inter se. Add to this character the farther one that the distant selves appear to our thought as having for hours of time been continuous with each other, and the most recent ones of them continuous with the Self of the present moment, melting into it by slow degrees; and we get a still stronger bond of union. As we think we see an identical bodily thing when, in spite of changes of structure, it exists continuously before our eyes, or when, however interrupted its presence, its quality returns unchanged; so here we think we experience an identical Self when it appears to us in an analogous way. Continuity makes us unite what dissimilarity might otherwise separate; similarity makes us unite what discontinuity might hold apart. And thus it is, finally, that Peter, awakening in the same bed with Paul, and recalling what both had in mind before they went to sleep, reidentifies and appropriates the 'warm' ideas as his, and is never tempted to confuse them with those cold and pale-appearing ones which he ascribes to Paul. As well might he confound Paul's body, which he only sees, with his own body, which he sees but also feels. Each of us when he awakens says, Here's the same old self again, just as he says, Here's the same old bed, the same old room, the same old world.<br>
<br>
The sense of our own personal identity, then, is exactly like any one of our other perceptions of sameness among phenomena. It is a conclusion grounded either on the resemblance in a fundamental respect, or on the continuity before the mind, of the phenomena compared.<br>
<br>
And it must not be taken to mean more than these grounds warrant, or treated as a sort of metaphysical or absolute Unity in which all differences are overwhelmed. The past and present selves compared are the same just so far as they are the same, and no farther. A uniform feeling of 'warmth,' of bodily existence (or an equally uniform feeling of pure psychic energy?) pervades them all; and this is what gives them a generic unity, and makes them the same in kind. But this generic unity coexists with generic differences just as real as the unity. And if from the one point of view they are one self, from others they are as truly not one but many selves. And similarly of the attribute of continuity; it gives its own kind of unity to the self - that of mere connectedness, or unbrokenness, a perfectly definite phenomenal thing - but it gives not a jot or tittle more. And this unbrokenness in the stream of selves, like the unbrokenness in an exhibition of 'dissolving views,' in no wise implies any farther unity or contradicts any amount of plurality in other respects.<br>
<br>
And accordingly we find that, where the resemblance and the continuity are no longer felt, the sense of personal identity goes too. We hear from our parents various anecdotes about our infant years, but we do not appropriate them as we do our own memories. Those breaches of decorum awaken no blush, those bright sayings no self-complacency. That child is a foreign creature with which our present self is no more identified in feeling than it is with some stranger's living child to-day. Why? Partly because great time-gaps break up all these early years - we cannot ascend to them by continuous memories; and partly because no representation of how the child felt comes up with the stories. We know what he said and did; but no sentiment of his little body, of his emotions, of his psychic strivings as they felt to him, comes up to contribute an element of warmth and intimacy to the narrative we hear, and the main bond of union with our present self thus disappears. It is the same with certain of our dimly-recollected experiences. We hardly know whether to appropriate them or to disown them as fancies, or things read or heard and not lived through. Their animal heat has evaporated; the feelings that accompanied them are so lacking in the recall, or so different from those we now enjoy, that no judgment of identity can be decisively cast.<br>
<br>
Resemblance among the parts of a continuum of feelings (especially bodily feelings) experienced along with things widely different in all other regards, thus constitutes the real and verifiable 'personal identity' which we feel. There is no other identity than this in the 'stream' of subjective consciousness which we described in the last chapter. Its parts differ, but under all their differences they are knit in these two ways; and if either way of knitting disappears, the sense of unity departs. If a man wakes up some fine day unable to recall any of his past experiences, so that he has to learn his biography afresh, or if he only recalls the facts of it in a cold abstract way as things that he is sure once happened; or if, without this loss of memory, his bodily and spiritual habits all change during the night, each organ giving a different tone, and the act of thought becoming aware of itself in a different way; he feels, and he says, that he is a changed person. He disowns his former me, gives himself a new name, identifies his present life with nothing from out of the older time. Such cases are not rare in mental pathology; but, as we still have some reasoning to do, we had better give no concrete account of them until the end of the chapter.<br>
<br>
This description of personal identity will be recognized by the instructed reader as the ordinary doctrine professed by the empirical school. Associationists in England and France, Herbartians in Germany, all describe the Self as an aggregate of which each part, as to its being, is a separate fact. So far so good, then; thus much is true whatever farther things may be true; and it is to the imperishable glory of Hume and Herbart and their successors to have taken so much of the meaning of personal identity out of the clouds and made of the Self an empirical and verifiable thing.<br>
<br>
But in leaving the matter here, and saying that this sum of passing things is all, these writers have neglected certain more subtle aspects of the Unity of Consciousness, to which we next must turn.<br>
<br>
Our recent simile of the herd of cattle will help us. It will be remembered that the beasts were brought together into one herd because their owner found on each of them his brand. The 'owner' symbolized here that 'section' of consciousness, or pulse of thought, which we have all along represented as the vehicle of the judgment of identity; and the 'brand' symbolizes the characters of warmth and continuity, by reason of which the judgment is made. There is found a self-brand, just as there is found a herd-brand. Each brand, so far, is the mark, or cause of our knowing, that certain things belong-together. But if the brand is the ratio cognoscendi of the belonging, the belonging, in the case of the herd, is in turn the ratio existendi of the brand. No beast would be so branded unless he belonged to the owner of the herd. They are not his because they are branded; they are branded because they are his. So that it seems as if our description of the belonging-together of the various selves, as a belonging-together which is merely represented, in a later pulse of thought, had knocked the bottom out of the matter, and omitted the most characteristic one of all the features found in the herd - a feature which common-sense finds in the phenomenon of personal identity as well, and for our omission of which she will hold us to a strict account. For common-sense insists that the unity of all the selves is not a mere appearance of similarity or continuity, ascertained after the fact. She is sure that it involves a real belonging to a real Owner, to a pure spiritual entity of some kind. Relation to this entity is what makes the self's constituents stick together as they do for thought. The individual beasts do not stick together, for all that they wear the same brand. Each wanders with whatever accidental mates it finds. The herd's unity is only potential, its centre ideal, like the 'centre of gravity' in physics, until the herdsman or owner comes. He furnishes a real centre of accretion to which the beasts are driven and by which they are held. The beasts stick together by sticking severally to him. Just so, common-sense insists, there must be a real proprietor in the case of the selves, or else their actual accretion into a 'personal consciousness' would never have taken place.<br>
<br>
To the usual empiricist explanation of personal consciousness this is a formidable reproof, because all the individual thoughts and feelings which have succeeded each other 'up to date' are represented by ordinary Associationism as in some inscrutable way 'integrating' or gumming themselves together on their own account, and thus fusing into a stream. All the incomprehensibilities which in Chapter VI we saw to attach to the idea of things fusing without a medium apply to the empiricist description of personal identity.<br>
<br>
But in our own account the medium is fully assigned, the herdsman is there, in the shape of something not among the things collected, but superior to them all, namely, the real, present onlooking, remembering, 'judging thought' or identifying 'section' of the stream. This is what collects, - 'owns' some of the past facts which it surveys, and disowns the rest, - and so makes a unity that is actualized and anchored and does not merely float in the blue air of possibility. And the reality of such pulses of thought, with their function of knowing, it will be remembered that we did not seek to deduce or explain, but simply assumed them as the ultimate kind of fact that the psychologist must admit to exist.<br>
<br>
But this assumption, though it yields much, still does not yield all that common-sense demands. The unity into which the Thought - as I shall for a time proceed to call, with a capital T, the present mental state - binds the individual past facts with each other and with itself, does not exist until the Thought is there. It is as if wild cattle were lassoed by a newly-created settler and then owned for the first time. But the essence of the matter to common-sense is that the past thoughts never were wild cattle, they were always owned. The Thought does not capture them, but as soon as it comes into existence it finds them already its own. How is this possible unless the Thought have a substantial identity with a former owner, - not a mere continuity or a resemblance, as in our account, but a real unity? Common-sense in fact would drive us to admit what we may for the moment call an Arch-Ego, dominating the entire stream of thought and all the selves that may be represented in it, as the ever self-same and changeless principle implied in their union. The 'Soul' of Metaphysics and the 'Transcendental Ego' of the Kantian Philosophy, are, as we shall soon see, but attempts to satisfy this urgent demand of common-sense. But, for a time at least, we can still express without any such hypotheses that appearance of never-lapsing ownership for which common-sense contends.<br>
<br>
For how would it be if the Thought, the present judging Thought, instead of being in any way substantially or transcendentally identical with the former owner of the past self, merely inherited his 'title,' and thus stood as his legal representative now? It would then, if its birth coincided exactly with the death of another owner, find the past self already its own as soon as it found it at all, and the past self would thus never be wild, but always owned, by a title that never lapsed. We can imagine a long succession of herdsmen coming rapidly into possession of the same cattle by transmission of an original title by bequest. May not the 'title' of a collective self be passed from one Thought to another in some analogous way?<br>
<br>
It is a patent fact of consciousness that a transmission like this actually occurs. Each pulse of cognitive consciousness, each Thought, dies away and is replaced by another. The other, among the things it knows, knows its own predecessor, and finding it 'warm,' in the way we have described, greets it, saying: ""Thou art mine, and part of the same self with me."" Each later Thought, knowing and including thus the Thoughts which went before, is the final receptacle - and appropriating them is the final owner - of all that they contain and own. Each Thought is thus born an owner, and dies owned, transmitting whatever it realized as its Self to its own later proprietor. As Kant says, it is as if elastic balls were to have not only motion but knowledge of it, and a first ball were to transmit both its motion and its consciousness to a second, which took both up into its consciousness and passed them to a third, until the last ball held all that the other balls had held, and realized it as its own. It is this trick which the nascent thought has of immediately taking up the expiring thought and 'adopting' it, which is the foundation of the appropriation of most of the remoter constituents of the self. Who owns the last self owns the self before the last, for what possesses the possessor possesses the possessed.<br>
<br>
It is impossible to discover any verifiable features in personal identity, which this sketch does not contain, impossible to imagine how any transcendent non-phenomenal sort of an Arch-Ego, were he there, could shape matters to any other result, or be known in time by any other fruit, than just this production of a stream of consciousness each 'section' of which should know, and knowing, hug to itself and adopt, all those that went before, - thus standing as the representative of the entire past stream; and which should similarly adopt the objects already adopted by any portion of this spiritual stream. Such standing-as-representative, and such adopting, are perfectly clear phenomenal relations. The Thought which, whilst it knows another Thought and the Object of that Other, appropriates the Other and the Object which the Other appropriated, is still a perfectly distinct phenomenon form that Other; it may hardly resemble it; it may be far removed from it in space and time.<br>
<br>
The only point that is obscure is the act of appropriation itself. Already in enumerating the constituents of the self and their rivalry, I had to use the word appropriate. And the quick-witted reader probably noticed at the time, in hearing how one constituent was let drop and disowned and another one held fast to and espoused, that the phrase was meaningless unless the constituents were objects in the hands of something else. A thing cannot appropriate itself; it is itself; and still less can it disown itself. There must be an agent of the appropriating and disowning; but that agent we have already named. It is the Thought to whom the various 'constituents' are known. That Thought is a vehicle of choice as well as of cognition; and among the choices it makes are these appropriations, or repudiations, of its 'own.' But the Thought never is an object in its own hands, it never appropriates or disowns itself. It appropriates to itself, it is the actual focus of accretion, the hook from which the chain of past selves dangles, planted firmly in the Present, which alone passes for real, and thus keeping the chain from being a purely ideal thing. Anon the hook itself will drop into the past with all it carries, and then be treated as an object and appropriated by a new Thought in the new present which will serve as living hook in turn. The present moment of consciousness is thus, as Mr. Hodgson says, the darkest in the whole series. It may feel its own immediate existence - we have all along admitted the possibility of this, hard as it is by direct introspection to ascertain the fact - but nothing can be known about it till it be dead and gone. Its appropriations are therefore less to itself than to the most intimately felt part of its present Object, the body, and the central adjustments, which accompany the act of thinking, in the head. These are the real nucleus of our personal identity, and it is their actual existence, realized as a solid present fact, which makes us say 'as sure as I exist, those past facts were part of myself.' They are the kernel to which the represented parts of the Self are assimilated, accreted, and knit on; and even were Thought entirely unconscious of itself in the act of thinking, these 'warm' parts of its present object would be a firm basis on which the consciousness of personal identity would rest.[18] Such consciousness, then, as a psychologic fact, can be fully described without supposing any other agent than a succession of perishing thoughts, endowed with the functions of appropriation and rejection, and of which some can know and appropriate or reject objects already known, appropriated, or rejected by the rest.<br>
<br>
To illustrate by diagram, let A, B, and C stand for three successive thoughts, each with its object inside of it.<br>
<br>
If B's object be A, and C's object be B; then A, B, and C would stand for three pulses in a consciousness of personal identity. Each pulse would be something different from the others; but B would know and adopt A, and C would know and adopt A and B. Three successive states of the same brain, on which each experience in passing leaves its mark, might very well engender thoughts differing from each other in just such a way as this.<br>
<br>
The passing Thought then seems to be the Thinker; and though there may be another non-phenomenal Thinker behind that, so far we do not seem to need him to express the facts. But we cannot definitively make up our mind about him until we have heard the reasons that have historically been used to prove his reality.<br>
<br>
The Pure Self or Inner Principle of Personal Unity. To a brief survey of the theories of the Ego let us then next proceed. They are three in number, as follows:<br>
<br>
1) The Spiritualist theory; 2) The Associationist theory; 3) The Transcendentalist theory.<br>
<br>
The Theory of the Soul. In Chapter VI we were led ourselves to the spiritualist theory of the 'Soul,' as a means of escape from the unintelligibilities of mind-stuff 'integrating' with itself, and from the physiological improbability of a material monad, with thought attached to it, in the brain. But at the end of the chapter we said we should examine the 'Soul' critically in a later place, to see whether it had any other advantages as a theory over the simple phenomenal notion of a stream of thought accompanying a stream of cerebral activity, by a law yet unexplained.<br>
<br>
The theory of the Soul is the theory of popular philosophy and of scholasticism, which is only popular philosophy made systematic. It declares that the principle of individuality within us must be substantial, for psychic phenomena are activities, and there can be no activity without a concrete agent. This substantial agent cannot be the brain but must be something immaterial; for its activity, thought, is both immaterial, and takes cognizance of immaterial things, and of material things in general and intelligible, as well as in particular and sensible ways, - all which powers are incompatible with the nature of matter, of which the brain is composed. Thought moreover is simple, whilst the activities of the brain are compounded of the elementary activities of each of its parts. Furthermore, thought is spontaneous or free, whilst all material activity is determined ab extra; and the will can turn itself against all corporeal goods and appetites, which would be impossible were it a corporeal function. For these objective reasons the principle of psychic life must be both immaterial and simple as well as substantial, must be what is called a Soul. The same consequence follows from subjective reasons. Our consciousness of personal identity assures us of our essential simplicity: the owner of the various constituents of the self, as we have seen them, the hypothetical Arch-Ego whom we provisionally conceived as possible, is a real entity of whose existence self-consciousness makes us directly aware. No material agent could thus turn round and grasp itself - material activities always grasp something else than the agent. And if a brain could grasp itself and be self-conscious, it would be conscious of itself as a brain and not as something of an altogether different kind. The Soul then exists as a simple spiritual substance in which the various psychic faculties, operations, and affections inhere.<br>
<br>
If we ask what a Substance is, the only answer is that it is a self-existent being, or one which needs no other subject in which to inhere. At bottom its only positive determination is Being, and this is something whose meaning we all realize even though we find it hard to explain. The Soul is moreover an individual being, and if we ask what that is, we are told to look in upon our Self, and we shall learn by direct intuition better than through any abstract reply. Our direct perception of our own inward being is in fact by many deemed to be the original prototype out of which our notion of simple active substance in general is fashioned. The consequences of the simplicity and substantiality of the Soul are its incorruptibility and natural immortality - nothing but God's direct fiat can annihilate it - and its responsibility at all times for whatever it may have ever done.<br>
<br>
This substantialist view of the soul was essentially the view of Plato and of Aristotle. It received its completely formal elaboration in the middle ages. It was believed in by Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, Leibnitz, Wolf, Berkeley, and is no defended by the entire modern dualistic or spiritualistic or common-sense school. Kant held to it while denying its fruitfulness as a premise for deducing consequences verifiable here below. Kant's successors, the absolute idealists, profess to have discarded it, - how that may be we shall inquire ere long. Let us make up our minds what to think of it ourselves.<br>
<br>
It is at all events needless for expressing the actual subjective phenomena of consciousness as they appear. We have formulated them all without its aid, by the supposition of a stream of thoughts, each substantially different from the rest, but cognitive of the rest and 'appropriative' of each other's content. At least, if I have not already succeeded in making this plausible to the reader, I am hopeless of convincing him by anything I could add now. The unity, the identity, the individuality, and the immateriality that appear in the psychic life are thus accounted for as phenomenal and temporal facts exclusively, and with no need of reference to any more simple or substantial agent than the present Thought or 'section' of the stream. We have seen it to be single and unique in the sense of having no separable parts (above, p. 239 ff.) - perhaps that is the only kind of simplicity meant to be predicated of the soul. The present Thought also has being, - at least all believers in the Soul believe so - and if there be no other Being in which it 'inheres,' it ought itself to be a 'substance'. If this kind of simplicity and substantiality were all that is predicated of the Soul, then it might appear that we had been talking of the soul all along, without knowing it, when we treated the present Thought as an agent, an owner, and the like. But the Thought is a perishing and not an immortal or incorruptible thing. Its successors may continuously succeed to it, resemble it, and appropriate it, but they are not it, whereas the Soul-Substance is supposed to be a fixed unchanging thing. By the Soul is always meant something behind the present Thought, another kind of substance, existing on a non-phenomenal plane.<br>
<br>
When we brought in the Soul at the end of the Chapter VI, as an entity which the various brain-processes were supposed to affect simultaneously, and which responded to their combined influence by single pulses of its thought, it was to escape integrated mind-stuff on the one hand, and an improbable cerebral monad on the other. But when (as now, after all we have been through since that earlier passage) we take the two formulations, first of a brain to whose processes pulses of thought simply correspond, and second, of one to whose processes pulses of thought in a Soul correspond, and compare them together, we see that at bottom the second formulation is only a more roundabout way than the first, of expressing the same bald fact. That bald fact is that when the brain acts, a thought occurs. The spiritualistic formulation says that the brain-processes knock the thought, so to speak, out of a Soul which stands there to receive their influence. The simpler formulation says that the thought simply comes. But what positive meaning has the Soul, when scrutinized, but the ground of possibility of the thought? And what is the 'knocking' but the determining of the possibility to actuality? And what is this after all but giving a sort of concreted form to one's belief that the coming of the thought, when the brain-processes occur, has some sort of ground in the nature of things? If the world Soul be understood merely to express that claim, it is a good word to use. But if it be held to do more, to gratify the claim, - for instance, to connect rationally the thought which comes, with the processes which occur, and to mediate intelligibly between their two disparate natures, - then it is an illusory term. It is, in fact, with the word Soul as with the word Substance in general. To say that phenomena inhere in a Substance is at bottom only to record one's protest against the notion that the bare existence of the phenomena is the total truth. A phenomenon would not itself be, we insist, unless there were something more than the phenomenon. To the more we give the provisional name of Substance. So, in the present instance, we ought certainly to admit that there is more than the bare fact of coexistence of a passing thought with a passing brain-state. But we do not answer the question 'What is that more?' when we say that it is a 'Soul' which the brain-state affects. This kind of more explains nothing; and when we are once trying metaphysical explanations we are foolish not to go as far as we can. For my own part I confess that the moment I become metaphysical and try to define the more, I find the notion of some sort of an anima mundi thinking in all of us to be a more promising hypothesis, in spite of all its difficulties, than that of a lot of absolutely individual souls. Meanwhile, as psychologists, we need not be metaphysical at all. The phenomena are enough, the passing Thought itself is the only verifiable thinker, and its empirical connection with the brain-process is the ultimate known law.<br>
<br>
To the other arguments which would prove the need of a soul, we may also turn a deaf ear. The argument from free-will can convince only those who believe in free-will; and even they will have to admit that spontaneity is just as possible, to say the least, in a temporary spiritual agent like our 'Thought' as in a permanent one like the supposed Soul. The same is true of the argument from the kinds of things cognized. Even if the brain could not cognize universals, immaterials, or its 'Self,' still the 'Thought' which we have relied upon in our account is not the brain, closely as it seems connected with it; and after all, if the brain could cognize at all, one does not well see why it might not cognize one sort of thing as well as another. The great difficulty is in seeing how a thing can cognize anything. This difficulty is not in the least removed by giving to the thing that cognizes the name of Soul. The Spiritualists do not deduce any of the properties of the mental life from otherwise known properties of the soul. They simply find various characters ready-made in the mental life, and these they clap into the Soul, saying, ""Lo! behold the source from whence they flow!"" The merely verbal character of this 'explanation' is obvious. The Soul invoked, far from making the phenomena more intelligible, can only be made intelligible itself by borrowing their form, - it must be represented, if at all, as a transcendent stream of consciousness duplicating the one we know.<br>
<br>
Altogether, the Soul is an outbirth of that sort of philosophizing whose great maxim, according to Dr. Hodgson, is: ""Whatever you are totally ignorant of, assert to be the explanation of everything else.""<br>
<br>
Locke and Kant, whilst still believing in the soul, began the work of undermining the notion that we know anything about it. Most modern writers of the mitigated, spiritualistic, or dualistic philosophy - the Scotch school, as it is often called among us - are forward to proclaim this ignorance, and to attend exclusively to the verifiable phenomena of self-consciousness, as we have laid them down. Dr. Wayland, for example, begins his Elements of Intellectual Philosophy with the phrase ""Of the essence of Mind we know nothing,"" and goes on: ""All that we are able to affirm of it is that it is something which perceives, reflects, remembers, imagines, and wills; but what that something is which exerts these energies we know not. It is only as we are conscious of the action of these energies that we are conscious of the existence of mind. It is only by the exertion of its own powers that the mind becomes cognizant of their existence. The cognizance of its powers, however, gives us no knowledge of that essence of which they are predicated. In these respects our knowledge of mind is precisely analogous to our knowledge of matter."" This analogy of our two ignorances is a favorite remark in the Scotch school. It is but a step to lump them together into a single ignorance, that of the 'Unknowable' to which any one fond of superfluities in philosophy may accord the hospitality of his belief, if it so please him, but which any one else may as freely ignore and reject.<br>
<br>
The Soul-theory is, then, a complete superfluity, so far as accounting for the actually verified facts of conscious experience goes. So far, no one can be compelled to subscribe to it for definite scientific reasons. The case would rest here, and the reader be left free to make his choice, were it not for other demands of a more practical kind.<br>
<br>
The first of these is Immortality, for which the simplicity and substantiality of the Soul seem to offer a solid guarantee. A 'stream' of thought, for aught that we see to be contained in its essence, may come to a full stop at any moment; but a simple substance is incorruptible and will, by its own inertia, persist in Being so long as the Creator does not by a direct miracle snuff it out. Unquestionably this is the stronghold of the spiritualistic belief, - as indeed the popular touchstone for all philosophies is the question, ""What is their bearing on a future life?""<br>
<br>
The Soul, however, when closely scrutinized, guarantees no immortality of a sort we care for. The enjoyment of the atom-like simplicity of their substance in soecula soeculorum would not to most people seem a consummation devoutly to be wished. The substance must give rise to a stream of consciousness continuous with the present stream, in order to arouse our hope, but of this the mere persistence of the substance per se offers no guarantee. Moreover, in the general advance of our moral ideas, there has come to be something ridiculous in the way our forefathers had of grounding their hopes of immortality on the simplicity of their substance. The demand for immortality is nowadays essentially teleological. We believe ourselves immortal because we believe ourselves fit for immortality. A 'substance, ought surely to perish, we think, if not worthy to survive, and an insubstantial 'stream' to prolong itself, provided it be worthy, if the nature of Things is organized in the rational way in which we trust it is. Substance or no substance, soul or 'stream,' what Lotze says of immortality is about all that human wisdom can say:<br>
<br>
""We have no other principle for deciding it than this general idealistic belief: that every created thing will continue whose continuance belongs to the meaning of the world, and so long as it does so belong; whilst every one will pass away whose reality is justified only in a transitory phase of the world's course. That this principle admits of no further application in human hands need hardly be said. We surely know not the merits which may give to one being a claim on eternity, nor the defects which would cut others off.""[19]<br>
<br>
A second alleged necessity for a soul-substance is our forensic responsibility before God. Locke caused an uproar when he said that the unity of consciousness made a man the same person, whether supported by the same substance or no, and that God would not, in the great day, make a person answer for what he remembered nothing of. It was supposed scandalous that our forgetfulness might thus deprive God of the chance of certain retributions, which otherwise would have enhanced his 'glory.' This is certainly a good speculative ground for retaining the Soul - at least for those who demand a plenitude of retribution. The mere stream of consciousness, with its lapses of memory, cannot possibly be as 'responsible' as a soul which is at the judgment day all that it ever was. To modern readers, however, who are less insatiate for retribution than their grandfathers, this argument will hardly be as convincing as it seems once to have been.<br>
<br>
One great use of the Soul has always been to account for, and at the same time to guarantee, the closed individuality of each personal consciousness. The thoughts of one soul must unite into one self, it was supposed, and must be eternally insulated from those of every other soul. But we have already begun to see that, although unity is the rule of each man's consciousness, yet in some individuals, at least, thoughts may split away from the others and form sepa- rate selves. As for insulation, it would be rash, in view of the phenomena of thought-transference, mesmeric influence and spirit-control, which are being alleged nowadays on better authority than ever before, to be too sure about that point either. The definitively closed nature of our personal consciousness is probably an average statistical resultant of many conditions, but not an elementary force or fact; so that, if one wishes to preserve the Soul, the less he draws his arguments from that quarter the better. So long as our self, on the whole, makes itself good and practically maintains itself as a closed individual, why, as Lotze says, is not that enough? And why is the being-an-individual in some inaccessible metaphysical way so much prouder an achievement?[20]<br>
<br>
My final conclusion, then, about the substantial Soul is that it explains nothing and guarantees nothing. Its successive thoughts are the only intelligible and verifiable things about it, and definitely to ascertain the correlations of these with brain-processes is as much as psychology can empirically do. From the metaphysical point of view, it is true that one may claim that the correlations have a rational ground; and if the word Soul could be taken to mean merely some such vague problematic ground, it would be unobjectionable. But the trouble is that it professes to give the ground in positive terms of a very dubiously credible sort. I therefore feel entirely free to discard the word Soul from the rest of this book. If I ever use it, it will be in the vaguest and most popular way. The reader who finds any comfort in the idea of the Soul, is, however, perfectly free to continue to believe in it; for our reasonings have not established the non-existence of the Soul; they have only proved its superfluity for scientific purposes.<br>
<br>
The next theory of the pure Self to which we pass is<br>
<br>
The Associationist Theory. Locke paved the way for it by the hypothesis he suggested of the same substance having two successive con- sciousnesses, or of the same consciousness being supported by more than one substance. He made his readers feel that the important unity of the Self was its verifiable and felt unity, and that a metaphysical or absolute unity would be insignificant, so long as a consciousness of diversity might be there.<br>
<br>
Hume showed how great the consciousness of diversity actually was. In the famous chapter on Personal Identity, in his Treatise on Human Nature, he writes as follows:<br>
<br>
""There are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment intimately conscious of what we call our SELF; that we feel its existence and its continuance in existence, and are certain, beyond the evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfect identity and simplicity.... Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary to that very experience which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of Self, after the manner it is here explained.... It must be some one impression that gives rise to every real idea.... If any impression gives rise to the idea of Self, that impression must continue invariably the same through the whole course of our lives, since self is supposed to exist after that manner. But there is no impression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at the same time.... For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep, so long am I insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my perceptions removed by death, and could I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body, I should be entirely annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requisite to make me a perfect non-entity. If anyone, upon serious and unprejudiced reflection, thinks he has a different notion of himself, I must confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in the right as well as I, and that we are essentially different in this particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple and continued which he calls himself; though I am certain there is no such principle in me.<br>
<br>
""But setting aside some metaphysicians of this kind, I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeeded each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perceptual flux and movement. Our eyes cannot turn in their sockets without varying our perceptions. Our thought is still more variable than our sight; and all our other senses and faculties contribute to this change; nor is there any single power of the soul which remains unalterably the same, perhaps for one moment. The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, repass, glide away and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations. There is properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in different; whatever natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity. The comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. They are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the most distant notion of the place where these scenes are represented, nor of the material of which it is composed.""<br>
<br>
But Hume, after doing this good piece of introspective work, proceeds to pour out the child with the bath, and to fly to as great an extreme as the substantialist philosophers. As they say the Self is nothing but Unity, unity abstract and absolute, so Hume says it is nothing but Diversity, diversity abstract and absolute; whereas in truth it is that mixture of unity and diversity which we ourselves have already found so easy to pick apart. We found among the objects of the stream certain feelings that hardly changed, that stood out warm and vivid in the past just as the present feeling does now; and we found the present feeling to be the centre of accretion to which, de proche en proche, these other feelings are, by the judging Thought, felt to cling. Hume says nothing of the judging Thought; and he denies this thread of resemblance, this core of sameness running through the ingredients of the Self, to exist even as a phenomenal thing. To him there is no tertium quid between pure unity and pure separateness. A succession of ideas ""connected by a close relation affords to an accurate view as perfect a notion of diversity as if there was no manner of relation"" at all.<br>
<br>
""All our distinct perceptions are distinct existences, and the mind never perceives any real connection among distinct existences. Did our perceptions either inhere in something simple or individual, or did the mind perceive some real connection among them, there would be no difficulty in the case. For my part, I must plead the privilege of a sceptic and confess that this difficulty is too hard for my understanding. I pretend not, however, to pronounce it insuperable. Others, perhaps,... may discover some hypothesis that will reconcile these contradictions.""[21]<br>
<br>
Hume is at bottom as much of a metaphysician as Thomas Aquinas. No wonder he can discover no 'hypothesis.' The unity of the parts of the stream is just as 'real' a connection as their diversity is a real separation; both connection and separation are ways in which the past thoughts appear to the present Thought; - unlike each other in respect of date and certain qualities - this is the separation; alike in other qualities, and continuous in time - this is the connection. In demanding a more 'real' connection than this obvious and verifiable likeness and continuity, Hume seeks 'the world behind the looking-glass,' and gives a striking example of that Absolutism which is the great disease of philosophic Thought.<br>
<br>
The chain of distinct existences into which Hume thus chopped up our 'stream' was adopted by all of his successors as a complete inventory of the facts. The associationist Philosophy was founded. Somehow, out of 'ideas,' each separate, each ignorant of its mates, but sticking together and calling each other up according to certain laws, all the higher forms of consciousness were to be explained, and among them the consciousness of our personal identity. The task was a hard one, in which what we called the psychologist's fallacy (p. 196 ff.) bore the brunt of the work. Two ideas, one of 'A,' succeeded by another of 'B,' were transmuted into a third idea of 'A after B.' An idea from last year returning now was taken to be an idea of last year; two similar ideas stood for an idea of similarity, and the like; palpable confusions, in which certain facts about the ideas, possible only to an outside knower of them, were put into the place of the ideas' own proper and limited deliverance and content. Out of such recurrences and resemblances in a series of discrete ideas and feelings a knowledge was somehow supposed to be engendered in each feeling that it was recurrent and resembling, and that it helped to form a series to whose unity the name I came to be joined. In the same way, substantially, Herbart,[22] in Germany, tried to show how a conflict of ideas would fuse into a manner of representing itself for which I was the consecrated name.[23]<br>
<br>
The defect of all these attempts is that the conclusion pretended to follow from certain premises is by no means rationally involved in the premises. A feeling of any kind, if it simply returns, ought to be nothing else than what it was at first. If memory of previous existence and all sorts of other cognitive functions are attributed to it when it returns, it is no longer the same, but a wholly different feeling, and ought to be so described. We have so described it with the greatest explicitness. We have said that feelings never do return. We have not pretended to explain this; we have recorded it as an empirically ascertained law, analogous to certain laws of brain-physiology; and, seeking to define the way in which new feelings do differ from the old, we have found them to be cognizant and appropriative of the old, whereas the old were always cognizant and appropriative of something else. Once more, this account pretended to be nothing more than a complete description of the facts. It explained them no more than the associationist account explains them. But the latter both assumes to explain them and in the same breath falsifies them, and for each reason stands condemned.<br>
<br>
It is but just to say that the associationist writers as a rule seem to have a lurking bad conscience about the Self; and that although they are explicit enough about what it is, namely, a train of feelings or thoughts, they are very shy about openly tackling the problem of how it comes to be aware of itself. Neither Bain nor Spencer, for example, directly touch this problem. As a rule, associationist writers keep talking about 'the mind' and about what 'we' do; and so, smuggling in surreptitiously what they ought avowedly to have postulated in the form of a present 'judging Thought,' they either trade upon their reader's lack of discernment or are undiscerning themselves.<br>
<br>
Mr. D. G. Thompson is the only associationist writer I know who perfectly escapes this confusion, and postulates openly what he needs. ""All states of consciousness,"" he says, ""imply and postulate a subject Ego, whose substance is unknown and unknowable, to which [why not say by which?] states of consciousness are referred as attributes, but which in the process of reference becomes objectified and becomes itself an attribute of a subject Ego which lies still beyond, and which ever eludes cognition though ever postulated for cognition.'[24] This is exactly our judging and remembering present 'Thought,' described in less simple terms.<br>
<br>
After Mr. Thompson, M. Taine and the two Mills deserve credit for seeking to be as clear as they can. Taine tells us in the first volume of his 'Intelligence' what the Ego is, - a continuous web of conscious events no more really distinct from each other[25] than rhomboids, triangles, and squares marked with chalk on a plank are really distinct, for the plank itself is one. In the second volume he says all these parts have a common character embedded in them, that of being internal [this is our character of 'warmness,' otherwise named]. This character is abstracted and isolated by a mental fiction, and is what we are conscious of as our self - 'this stable within is what each of us calls I or me.' Obviously M. Taine forgets to tell us what this 'each of us' is, which suddenly starts up and performs the abstraction and 'calls' its product I or me. The character does not abstract itself. Taine means by 'each of us' merely the present 'judging Thought' with its memory and tendency to appropriate, but he does not name it distinctly enough, and lapses into the fiction that the entire series of thoughts, the entire 'plank,' is the reflecting psychologist.<br>
<br>
James Mill, after defining Memory as a train of associated ideas beginning with that of my past self and ending with that of my present self, defines my Self as a train of ideas of which Memory declares the first to be continuously connected with the last. The successive associated ideas 'run, as it were, into a single point of consciousness.'[26] John Mill, annotating this account, says:<br>
<br>
""The phenomenon of Self and that of Memory are merely two sides of the same fact, or two different modes of viewing the same fact. We may, as psychologists, set out from either of them, and refer the other to it.... But it is hardly allowable to do both. At least it must be said that by doing so we explain neither. We only show that the two things are essentially the same; that my memory of having ascended Skiddaw on a given day, and my consciousness of being the same person who ascended Skiddaw on that day, are two modes of stating the same fact: a fact which psychology has as yet failed to resolve into anything more elementary. In analyzing the complex phenomena of consciousness, we must come to something ultimate; and we seem to have reached two elements which have a good prima facie claim to that title. There is, first,... the difference between a fact and the Thought of that fact: a distinction which we are able to cognize in the past, and which then constitutes Memory, and in the future, when it constitutes Expectation; but in neither case can we give any account of it except that it exists.... Secondly, in addition to this, and setting out from the belief... that the idea I now have was derived from a previous sensation... there is the further conviction that this sensation... was my own; that it happened to my self. In other words, I am aware of a long and uninterrupted succession of past feelings, going back as far as memory reaches, and terminating with the sensations I have at the present moment, all of which are connected by an inexplicable tie, that distinguishes them not only from any succession or combination in mere thought, but also from the parallel succession of feelings which I believe, on satisfactory evidence, to have happened to each of the other beings, shaped like myself, whom I perceive around me. This succession of feelings, which I call my memory of the past, is that by which I distinguish my Self. Myself is the person who had that series of feelings, and I know nothing of myself, by direct knowledge, except that I had them. But there is a bond of some sort among all the parts of the series, which makes me say that they were feelings of a person who was the same person throughout [according to us this is their 'warmth' and resemblance to the 'central spiritual self' now actually felt] and a different person from those who had any of the parallel successions of feelings; and this bond, to me, constitutes my Ego. Here I think the question must rest, until some psychologist succeeds better than anyone else has done, in showing a mode in which the analysis can be carried further.""[27]<br>
<br>
The reader must judge of our own success in carrying the analysis farther. The various distinctions we have made are all part of an endeavor so to do. John Mill himself, in a later-written passage, so far from advancing in the line of analysis, seems to fall back upon something perilously near to the Soul. He says:<br>
<br>
""The fact of recognizing a sensation,... remembering that it has been felt before, is the simplest and most elementary fact of memory: and the inexplicable tie... which connects the present consciousness with the past one of which it reminds me, is as near as I think we can get to a positive conception of Self. That there is something real in this tie, real as the sensations themselves, and not a mere product of the laws of thought without any fact corresponding to it, I hold to be indubitable... This original element,... to which we cannot give any name but its own peculiar one, without implying some false or ungrounded theory, is the Ego, or Self. As such I ascribe a reality to the Ego - to my own mind - different from that real existence as a Permanent Possibility, which is the only reality I acknowledge in Matter.... We are forced to apprehend every part of the series as linked with the other parts by something in common which is not the feelings themselves, any more than the succession of the feelings is the feelings themselves; and as that which is the same in the first as in the second, in the second as in the third, in the third as in the fourth, and so on, must be the same in the first and in the fiftieth, this common element is a permanent element. But beyond this we can affirm nothing of it except the states of consciousness themselves. The feelings or consciousnesses which belong or have belonged to it, and its possibilities of having more, are the only facts there are to be asserted of Self - the only positive attributes, except permanence, which we can ascribe to it.""[28]<br>
<br>
Mr. Mill's habitual method of philosophizing was to affirm boldly some general doctrine derived from his father, and then make so many concessions of detail to its enemies as practically to abandon it altogether.[29] In this place the concessions amount, so far as they are intelligible, to the admission of something very like the Soul. This 'inexplicable tie' which connects the feelings, this 'something in common' by which they are linked and which is not the passing feelings themselves, but something 'permanent,' of which we can 'affirm nothing' save its attributes and its permanence, what is it but metaphysical Substance come again to life? Much as one must respect the fairness of Mill's temper, quite as much must one regret his failure of acumen at this point. At bottom he makes the same blunder as Hume: the sensations per se, he thinks, have no 'tie.' The tie of resemblance and continuity which the remembering Thought finds among them is not a 'real tie' but 'a mere product of the laws of thought;' and the fact that the present Thought 'appropriates' them is also no real tie. But whereas Hume was contended to say that there might after all be no 'real tie,' Mill, unwilling to admit this possibility, is driven, like any scholastic, to place it in a non-phenomenal world.<br>
<br>
John Mill's concessions may be regarded as the definitive bankruptcy of the associationist description of the consciousness of self, starting, as it does, with the best intentions, and dimly conscious of the path, but 'perplexed in the extreme' at last with the inadequacy of those 'simple feelings,' non-cognitive, non-transcendent of themselves, which were the only baggage it was willing to take along. One must beg memory, knowledge on the part of the feelings of something outside themselves. That granted, every other true thing follows naturally, and it is hard to go astray. The knowledge the present feeling has of the past ones is a real tie between them, so is their resemblance; so is their continuity; so is the one's 'appropriation' of the other: all are real ties, realized in the judging Thought of every moment, the only place where disconnections could be realized, did they exist. Hume and Mill both imply that a disconnection can be realized there, whilst a tie cannot. But the ties and the disconnections are exactly on a par, in this matter of self-consciousness. The way in which the present Thought appropriates the past is a real way, so long as no other owner appropriates it in a more real way, and so long as the Thought has no grounds for repudiating it stronger than those which lead to its appropriation. But no other owner ever does in point of fact present himself for my past; and the grounds which I perceive for appropriating it - - viz., continuity and resemblance with the present - outweigh those I perceive for disowning it - - viz., distance in time. My present Thought stands thus in the plenitude of ownership of the train of my past selves, is owner not only de facto, but de jure, the most real owner there can be, and all without the supposition of any 'inexplicable tie,' but in a perfectly verifiable and phenomenal way.<br>
<br>
Turn we now to what we may call<br>
<br>
The Transcendentalist Theory. which owes its origin to Kant. Kant's own statements are too lengthy and obscure for verbatim quotation here, so I must give their substance only. Kant starts, as I understand him, from a view of the Object essentially like our own description of it on p. 275 ff., that is, it is a system of things, qualities or facts in relation. ""Object is that in the knowledge (Begriff) of which the Manifold of a given Perception is connected.""[30] But whereas we simple begged the vehicle of this connected knowledge in the shape of what we call the present Thought, or section of the Stream of Consciousness (which we declared to be the ultimate fact for psychology), Kant denies this to be an ultimate fact and insists on analyzing it into a large number of distinct, though equally essential, elements. The 'Manifoldness' of the Object is due to Sensibility, which per se is chaotic, and the unity is due to the synthetic handling which this Manifold receives from the higher faculties of Intuition, Apprehension, Imagination, Understanding, and Apperception. It is the one essential spontaneity of the Understanding which, under these different names, brings unity into the manifold of sense.<br>
<br>
""The Understanding is, in fact, nothing more than the faculty of binding together a priori, and of bringing the Manifold of given ideas under the unity of Apperception, which consequently is the supreme principle of all human knowledge"" ( § 16).<br>
<br>
The material connected must be given by lower faculties to the Understanding, for the latter is not an intuitive faculty, but by nature 'empty.' And the bringing of this material 'under the unity of Apperception' is explained by Kant to mean the thinking it always so that, whatever its other determinations be, it may be known as thought by me.[31] Though this consciousness, that I think it, need not be at every moment explicitly realized, it is always capable of being realized. For if an object incapable of being combined with the idea of a thinker were there, how could it be known, how related to other objects, how form part of 'experience' at all?<br>
<br>
The awareness that I think is therefore implied in all experience. No connected consciousness of anything without that of Self as its presupposition and 'transcendental' condition! All things, then, so far as they are intelligible at all, are so through combination with pure consciousness of Self, and apart from this, at least potential, combination nothing is knowable to us at all.<br>
<br>
But this self, whose consciousness Kant thus established deductively as a conditio sine quâ non of experience, is in the same breath denied by him to have any positive attributes. Although Kant's name for it - the 'original transcendental synthetic Unity of Apperception' - is so long, our consciousness about it is, according to him, short enough. Self-consciousness of this 'transcendental' sort tells us, 'not how we appear, not how we inwardly are, but only that we are' ( § 25). At the basis of our knowledge of our selves there lies only ""the simple and utterly empty idea: I; of which we cannot even say we have a notion, but only a consciousness which accompanies all notions. In this I, or he or it (the thing) which thinks, nothing more is represented than the bare transcendental Subject of the knowledge = x, which is only recognized by the thoughts which are its predicates, and of which, taken by itself, we cannot form the least conception"" (ibid. 'Paralogisms'). The pure Ego of all apperception is thus for Kant not the soul, but only that 'Subject' which is the necessary correlate of the Object in all knowledge. There is a soul, Kant thinks, but this mere ego-form of our consciousness tells us nothing about it, neither whether it be substantial, nor whether it be immaterial, nor whether it be simple, nor whether it be permanent. These declarations on Kant's part of the utter barrenness of the consciousness of the pure Self, and of the consequent impossibility of any deductive or 'rational' psychology, are what, more than anything else, earned for him the title of the 'all-destroyer.' The only self we know anything positive about, he thinks, is the empirical me, not the pure I; the self which is an object among other objects and the 'constituents' of which we ourselves have seen, and recognized to be phenomenal things appearing in the form of space as well as time.<br>
<br>
This, for our purposes, is a sufficient account of the 'transcendental' Ego.<br>
<br>
Those purposes go no farther than to ascertain whether anything in Kant's conception ought to make us give up our own, of a remembering and appropriating Thought inces- santly renewed. In many respects Kant's meaning is obscure, but it will not be necessary for us to squeeze the texts in order to make sure what it actually and historically was. If we can define clearly two or three things which it may possibly have been, that will help us just as much to clear our own ideas.<br>
<br>
On the whole, a defensible interpretation of Kant's view would take somewhat the following shape. Like ourselves he believes in a Reality outside the mind of which he writes, but the critic who vouches for that reality does so on grounds of faith, for it is not a verifiable phenomenal thing. Neither is it manifold. The 'Manifold' which the intellectual functions combine is a mental manifold altogether, which thus stands between the Ego of Apperception and the outer Reality, but still stands inside the mind. In the function of knowing there is a multiplicity to be connected, and Kant brings this multiplicity inside the mind. The Reality becomes a mere empty locus, or unknowable, the so-called Noumenon; the manifold phenomenon is in the mind. We, on the contrary, put the Multiplicity with the Reality outside, and leave the mind simple. Both of us deal with the same elements - thought and object - the only question is in which of them the multiplicity shall be lodged. Wherever it is lodged it must be 'synthetized' when it comes to be thought. And that particular way of lodging it will be the better, which, in addition to describing the facts naturally, makes the 'mystery of synthesis' least hard to understand.<br>
<br>
Well, Kant's way of describing the facts is mythological. The notion of our thought being this sort of an elaborate internal machine-shop stands condemned by all we said in favor of its simplicity on pages 276 ff. Our Thought is not composed of parts, however so composed its objects may be. There is no originally chaotic manifold in it to be reduced to order. There is something almost shocking in the notion of so chaste a function carrying this Kantian hurlyburly in her womb. If we are to have a dualism of Thought and Reality at all, the multiplicity should be lodged in the latter and not in the former member of the couple of related terms. The parts and the relations surely belong less to the knower than to what is known.<br>
<br>
But even were all the mythology true, the process of synthesis would in no whit be explained by calling the inside of the mind its seat. No mystery would be made lighter by such means. It is just as much a puzzle how the 'Ego' can employ the productive Imagination to make the Understanding use the categories to combine the data which Recognition, Association, and Apprehension receive from sensible Intuition, as how the Thought can combine the objective facts. Phrase it as one may, the difficulty is always the same: the Many known by the One. Or does one seriously think he understands better how the knower 'connects' its objects, when one calls the former a transcendental Ego and the latter a 'Manifold of Intuition' than when one calls them Thought and Things respectively? Knowing must have a vehicle. Call the vehicle Ego, or call it Thought, Psychosis, Soul, Intelligence, Consciousness, Mind, Reason, Feeling, - what you like - it must know. The best grammatical subject for the verb know would, if possible, be one from whose other properties the knowing could be deduced. And if there be no such subject, the best one would be that with the fewest ambiguities and the least pretentious name. By Kant's confession, the transcendental Ego has no properties, and from it nothing can be deduced. Its name is pretentious, and, as we shall presently see, has its meaning ambiguously mixed up with that of the substantial soul. So on every possible account we are excused from using it instead of our own term of the present passing 'Thought,' as the principle by which the Many is simultaneously known.<br>
<br>
The ambiguity referred to in the meaning of the transcendental Ego is as to whether Kant signified by it an Agent, and by the Experience it helps to constitute, an operation; or whether the experience is an event produced in an unassigned way, and the Ego a mere indwelling element therein contained. If an operation be meant, then Ego and Manifold must both be existent prior to that collision which results in the experience of one by the other. If a mere analysis is meant, there is no such prior existence, and the elements only are in so far as they are in union. Now Kant's tone and language are everywhere the very words of one who is talking of operations and the agents by which they are performed.[32] And yet there is reason to think that at bottom he may have had nothing of the sort in mind.[33] In this uncertainty we need again do no more than decide what to think of his transcendental Ego if it be an agent.<br>
<br>
Well, if it be so, Transcendentalism is only Substantialism grown shame-faced, and the Ego only a 'cheap and nasty' edition of the soul. All our reasons for preferring the 'Thought' to the 'Soul' apply with redoubled force when the Soul is shrunk to this estate. The Soul truly explained nothing; the 'syntheses,' which she performed, were simply taken ready-made and clapped on to her as expressions of her nature taken after the fact; but at least she had some semblance of nobility and outlook. She was called active; might select; was responsible, and permanent in her way. The Ego is simply nothing: as ineffectual and windy an abortion as Philosophy can show. It would indeed by one of Reason's tragedies if the good Kant, with all his honesty and strenuous pains, should have deemed this conception an important outbirth of his thought.<br>
<br>
But we have seen that Kant deemed it of next to no importance at all. It was reserved for his Fichtean and Hegelian successors to call it the first Principle of Philosophy, to spell its name in capitals and pronounce it with adoration, to act, in short, as if they were going up in a balloon, whenever the notion of it crossed their mind. Here again, however, I am uncertain of the facts of history, and know that I may not read my authors aright. The whole lesson of Kantian and post-Kantian speculation is, it seems to me, the lesson of simplicity. With Kant, complication both of thought and statement was an inborn infirmity, enhanced by the musty academicism of his Königsberg existence. With Hegel is was a raging fever. Terribly, therefore, do the sour grapes which these fathers of philosophy have eaten set our teeth on edge. We have in England and America, however, a contemporary continuation of Hegelism from which, fortunately, somewhat simpler deliverances come; and, unable to find any definite psychology in what Hegel, Rosenkranz, or Erdmann tells us of the Ego, I turn to Caird and Green.<br>
<br>
The great difference, practically, between these authors and Kant is their complete abstraction from the onlooking Psychologist and from the Reality he thinks he knows; or rather it is the absorption of both of these outlying terms into the proper topic of Psychology, viz., the mental experience of the mind under observation. The Reality coalesces with the connected Manifold, the Psychologist with the Ego, knowing becomes 'connecting,' and there results no longer a finite or criticisable, but an 'absolute' Experience, of which the Object and the Subject are always the same. Our finite 'Thought' is virtually and potentially this eternal (or rather this 'timeless'), absolute Ego, and only provisionally and speciously the limited thing which it seems primâ facie to be. The later 'sections' of our 'Stream,' which come and appropriate the earlier ones, are those earlier ones, just as in substantialism the Soul is throughout all time the same.[34] This 'solipsistic' char- acter of an Experience conceived as absolute really annihilates psychology as a distinct body of science.<br>
<br>
Psychology is a natural science, an account of particularly finite streams of thought, coexisting and succeeding in time. It is of course conceivable (though far from clearly so) that in the last metaphysical resort all these streams of thought may be thought by one universal All-thinker. But in this metaphysical notion there is no profit for psychology; for grant that one Thinker does think in all of us, still what He thinks in me and what in you can never be deduced from the bare idea of Him. The idea of Him seems even to exert a positively paralyzing effect on the mind. The existence of finite thoughts is suppressed altogether. Thought's characteristics, as Professor Green says, are<br>
<br>
""not to be sought in the incidents of individual lives which last but for a day.... No knowledge, nor any mental act involved in knowledge, can properly be called a 'phenomenon of consciousness.'... For a phenomenon is a sensible event, related in the way of antecedence or consequence to other sensible events, but the consciousness which constitutes a knowledge... is not an event so related nor made up of such events.""<br>
<br>
Again, if<br>
<br>
""we examine the constituents of any perceived object,... we shall find alike that it is only for consciousness that they can exist, and that the consciousness for which they thus exist cannot be merely a series of phenomena or a succession of states.... It then becomes clear that there is a function of consciousness, as exercised in the most rudimentary experience [namely, the function of synthesis] which is incompatible with the definition of consciousness as any sort of succession of any sort of phenomena.""[35]<br>
<br>
Were we to follow these remarks, we should have to abandon our notion of the 'Thought' (perennially renewed in time, but always cognitive thereof), and to espouse instead of it an entity copied from thought in all essential respects, but differing from it in being 'out of time.' What psychology can gain by this barter would be hard to divine. Moreover this resemblance of the timeless Ego to the Soul is completed by other resemblances still. The monism of the post-Kantian idealists seems always lapsing into a regular old-fashioned spiritualistic dualism. They incessantly talk as if, like the Soul, their All-thinker were an Agent, operating on detached materials of sense. This may come from the accidental fact that the English writings of the school have been more polemic than constructive, and that a reader may often take for a positive profession a statement ad hominem meant as part of a reduction to the absurd, or mistake the analysis of a bit of knowledge into elements for a dramatic myth about its creation. But I think the matter has profounder roots. Professor Green constantly talks of the 'activity' of Self as a 'condition' of knowledge taking place. Facts are said to become incorporated with other facts only through the 'action of a combining self-consciousness upon data of sensation.'<br>
<br>
""Every object we perceive... requires, in order to its presentation, the action of a principle of consciousness, not itself subject to conditions of time, upon successive appearances, such action as may hold the appearances together, without fusion, in an apprehended fact.""[36]<br>
<br>
It is needless to repeat that the connection of things in our knowledge is in no whit explained by making it the deed of an agent whose essence is self-identity and who is out of time. The agency of phenomenal thought coming and going in time is just as easy to understand. And when it is furthermore said that the agent that combines is the same 'self-distinguishing subject' which 'in another mode of its activity' presents the manifold object to itself, the unintelligibilities become quite paroxysmal, and we are forced to confess that the entire school of thought in question, in spite of occasional glimpses of something more refined, still dwells habitually in that mythological stage of thought where phenomena are explained as results of dramas enacted by entities which but reduplicate the characters of the phenomena themselves. The self must not only know its object, - that is too bald and dead a relation to be written down and left in its static state. The knowing must be painted as a 'famous victory' in which the object's distinctness is in some way 'overcome.'<br>
<br>
""The self exists as one self only as it opposes itself, as object, to itself as subject, and immediately denies and transcends that opposition. Only because it is such a concrete unity, which has in itself a resolved contradiction, can the intelligence cope with all the manifoldness and division of the mighty universe, and hope to master its secrets. As the lightning sleeps in the dew-drop, so in the simple and transparent unity of self-consciousness there is held in equilibrium that vital antagonism of opposites which... seems to rend the world asunder. The intelligence is able to understand the world, or, in other words, to break down the barrier itself and things and find itself in them, just because its own existence is implicitly the solution of all the division and conflict of things.""[37]<br>
<br>
This dynamic (I had almost written dynamitic) way of representing knowledge has the merit of not being tame. To turn from it to our own psychological formulation is like turning from the fireworks, trap-doors, and transformations of the pantomime into the insipidity of the midnight, where<br>
<br>
""ghastly through the drizzling rain, On the bald street breaks the blank day!""[38] And yet turn we must, with the confession that our 'Thought' - a cognitive phenomenal event in time - is, if it exist at all, itself the only Thinker which the facts require. The only service that transcendental egoism has done to psychology has been by its protests against Hume's 'bundle' - theory of mind. But this service has been ill-performed; for the Egoists themselves, let them say what they will, believe in the bundle, and in their own system merely tie it up, with their special transcendental string, invented for that use alone. Besides, they talk as if, with this miraculous tying or 'relating,' the Ego's duties were done. Of its far more important duty of choosing some of the things it ties and appropriating them, to the exclusion of the rest, they tell us never a word. To sum up, then, my own opinion of the transcendentalist school, it is (whatever ulterior metaphysical truth it may divine) a school in which psychology at least has naught to learn, and whose deliverances about the Ego in particular in no wise oblige us to revise our own formulation of the Stream of Thought.[39]<br>
<br>
With this, all possible rival formulations have been discussed. The literature of the Self is large, but all its authors may be classed as radical or mitigated representatives of the three schools we have named, substantialism, associationism, or transcendentalism. Our own opinion must be classed apart, although it incorporates essential elements from all three schools. There need never have been a quarrel between associationism and its rivals if the former had admitted the indecomposable unity of every pulse of thought, and the latter been willing to allow that 'perishing' pulses of thought might recollect and know.<br>
<br>
We may sum up by saying that personality implies the incessant presence of two elements, and objective person, known by a passing subjective Thought and recognized as continuing in time. Hereafter let us see the words ME and I for the empirical person and the judging Thought.<br>
<br>
Certain vicissitudes in the me demand our notice.<br>
<br>
In the first place, although its changes are gradual, they become in time great. The central part of the me is the feeling of the body and of the adjustments in the head; and in the feeling of the body should be included that of the general emotional tones and tendencies, for at bottom these are but the habits in which organic activities and sensibilities run. Well, from infancy to old age, this assemblage of feelings, most constant of all, is yet a prey to slow mutation. Our powers, bodily and mental, change at least as fast.[40] Our possessions notoriously are perishable facts.<br>
<br>
The identity which the I discovers, as it surveys this long procession, can only be a relative identity, that of a slow shifting in which there is always some common ingredient retained.[41] The commonest element of all, the most uniform, is the possession of the same memories. However different the man may be from the youth, both look back on the same childhood, and call it their own.<br>
<br>
Thus the identity found by the I in its me is only a loosely construed thing, an identity 'on the whole,' just like that which any outside observer might find in the same assemblage of facts. We often say of a man 'he is so changed one would not know him'; and so does a man, less often, speak of himself. These changes in the me, recognized by the I, or by outside observers, may be grave or slight. They deserve some notice here.<br>
<br>
The Mutations of the Self. may be divided into two main classes:<br>
<br>
1. Alterations of memory; and 2. Alterations in the present bodily and spiritual selves.<br>
<br>
1. Alterations of memory are either losses or false recollections. In either case the me is changed. Should a man be punished for what he did in his childhood and no longer remembers? Should he be punished for crimes enacted in post-epileptic unconsciousness, somnambulism, or in any involuntarily induced state of which no recollection is retained? Law, in accord with common-sense, says: ""No; he is not the same person forensically now which he was then."" These losses of memory are a normal incident of extreme old age, and the person's me shrinks in the ratio of the facts that have disappeared.<br>
<br>
In dreams we forget our waking experiences; they are as if they were not. And the converse is also true. As a rule, no memory is retained during the waking state of what has happened during mesmeric trance, although when again entranced the person may remember it distinctly, and may then forget facts belonging to the waking state. We thus have, within the bounds of healthy mental life, an approach to an alteration of me's.<br>
<br>
False memories are by no means rare occurrences in most of us, and, whenever they occur, they distort the consciousness of the me. Most people, probably, are in doubt about certain matters ascribed to their past. They may have seen them, may have said them, done them, or they may only have dreamed or imagined they did so. The content of a dream will oftentimes insert itself into the stream of real life in a most perplexing way. The most frequent source of false memory is the accounts we give to others of our experiences. Such accounts we almost al- ways make both more simple and more interesting than the truth. We quote what we should have said or done, rather than what we really said or did; and in the first telling we may be fully aware of the distinction. But ere long the fiction expels the reality from memory and reigns in its stead alone. This is one great source of the fallibility of testimony meant to be quite honest. Especially where the marvellous is concerned, the story takes a tilt that way, and the memory follows the story. Dr. Carpenter quotes from Miss Cobbe the following, as in instance of a very common sort:<br>
<br>
""It happened once to the Writer to hear a most scrupulously conscientious friend narrate an incident of table-turning, to which she appended an assurance that the table rapped when nobody was within a yard of it. The writer being confounded by this latter fact, the lady, though fully satisfied of the accuracy of her statement, promised to look at the note she had made ten years previously of the transaction. The note was examined, and was found to contain the distinct statement that the table rapped when the hands of six persons rested on it! The lady's memory as to all other points proved to be strictly correct; and in this point she had erred in entire good faith.""[42]<br>
<br>
It is next to impossible to get a story of this sort accurate in all its details, although it is the inessential details that suffer most change.[43] Dickens and Balzac were said to have constantly mingled their fictions with their real experiences. Every one must have known some specimen of our mortal dust so intoxicated with the thought of his own person and the sound of his own voice as never to be able even to think the truth when his autobiography was in question. Amiable, harmless, radiant J. V.! mayst thou ne'er wake to the difference between thy real and thy fondly-imagined self![44]<br>
<br>
2. When we pass beyond alterations of memory to abnormal alterations in the present self we have still graver disturbances. These alterations are of three main types, from the descriptive point of view. But certain cases unite features of two or more types; and our knowledge of the elements and causes of these changes of personality is so slight that the division into types must not be regarded as having any profound significance. The types are:<br>
<br>
(1) Insane delusions; (2) Alternating selves; (3) Mediumships or possessions.<br>
<br>
1) In insanity we often have delusions projected into the past, which are melancholic or sanguine according to the character of the disease. But the worst alterations of the self come from present perversions of sensibility and impulse which leave the past undisturbed, but induce the patient to think that the present me is an altogether new personage. Something of this sort happens normally in the rapid expansion of the whole character, intellectual as well as volitional, which takes place after the time of puberty. The pathological cases are curious enough to merit longer notice.<br>
<br>
The basis of our personality, as M. Ribot says, is that feeling of our vitality which, because it is so perpetually present, remains in the background of our consciousness.<br>
<br>
""It is the basis because, always present, always acting, without peace or rest, it knows neither sleep nor fainting, and lasts as long as life itself, of which it is one form. It serves as a support to that self-conscious me which memory constitutes, it is the medium of association among its other parts.... Suppose now that it were possible at once to change our body and put another into its place: skeleton, vessels, viscera, muscles, skin, everything made new, except the nervous system with its stored-up memory of the past. There can be no doubt that in such a case the afflux of unaccustomed vital sensations would produce the gravest disorders. Between the old sense of existence engraved on the nervous system, and the new one acting with all the intensity of its reality and novelty, there would be irreconcilable contradiction.""[45]<br>
<br>
With the beginnings of cerebral disease there often happens something quite comparable to this:<br>
<br>
""Masses of new sensation, hitherto foreign to the individual, impulses and ideas of the same inexperienced kind, for example terrors, representations of enacted crime, of enemies pursuing one, etc. At the outset, these stand in contrast with the old familiar me, as a strange, often astonishing and abhorrent thou.[46] Often their invasion into the former circle of feelings is felt as if the old self were being taken possession of by a dark overpowering might, and the fact of such 'possession' is described in fantastic images. Always this doubleness, this struggle of the old self against the new discordant forms of experience, is accompanied with painful mental conflict, with passion, with violent emotional excitement. This is in great part the reason for the common experience, that the first stage in the immense majority of cases of mental disease is an emotional alteration particularly of a melancholic sort. If now the brain-affection, which is the immediate cause of the new abnormal train of ideas, be not relieved, the latter becomes confirmed. It may gradually contract associations with the trains of ideas which characterized the old self, or portions of the latter may be extinguished and lost in the progress of the cerebral malady, so that little by little the opposition of the two conscious me's abates, and the emotional storms are calmed. But by that time the old me itself has been falsified and turned into another by those associations, by that reception into itself of the abnormal elements of feeling and of will. The patient may again be quiet, and his thought sometimes logically correct, but in it the morbid erroneous ideas are always present, with the adhesions they have contracted, as uncontrollable premises, and the man is no longer the same, but a really new person, his old self transformed.""[47]<br>
<br>
But the patient himself rarely continues to describe the change in just these terms unless new bodily sensations in him or the loss of old ones play a predominant part. Mere perversions of sight and hearing, or even of impulse, soon cease to be felt as contradictions of the unity of the me.<br>
<br>
What the particular perversions of the bodily sensibility may be, which give rise to there contradictions, is for the most part impossible for a sound-minded person to conceive. One patient has another self that repeats all his thoughts for him. Others, among whom are some of the first characters in history, have familiar daemons who speak with them, and are replied to. In another someone 'makes' his thoughts for him. Another has two bodies, lying in different beds. Some patients feel as if they had lost parts of their bodies, teeth, brain, stomach, etc. In some it is made of wood, glass, butter, etc. In some it does not exist any longer, or is dead, or is a foreign object quite separate from the speaker's self. Occasionally, parts of the body lose their connection for consciousness with the rest, and are treated as belonging to another person and moved by a hostile will. Thus the right hand may fight with the left as with an enemy.[48] Or the cries of the patient himself are assigned to another person with whom the patient expresses sympathy. The literature of insanity is filled with narratives of such illusions as these. M. Taine quotes from a patient of Dr. Krishaber an account of sufferings, from which it will be seen how completely aloof from what is normal a man's experience may suddenly become:<br>
<br>
""After the first or second day it was for some weeks impossible to observe or analyze myself. The suffering - angina pectoris - was too overwhelming. It was not till the first days of January that I could give an account to myself of what I experienced.... Here is the first thing of which I retain a clear rememberance. I was alone, and already a prey to permanent visual trouble, when I was suddenly seized with a visual trouble infinitely more pronounced. Objects grew small and receded to infinite distances - men and things together. I was myself im- measurably far away. I looked about me with terror and astonishment; the world was escaping from me.... I remarked at the same time that my voice was extremely far away from me, that it sounded no longer as if mine. I struck the ground with my foot, and perceived its resistance; but this resistance seemed illusory - not that the soil was soft, but that the weight of my body was reduced to almost nothing.... I had the feeling of being without weight.. "" In addition to being so distant, ""objects appeared to me flat. When I spoke with anyone, I saw him like an image cut out of paper with no relief.... This sensation lasted intermittently for two years.... Constantly it seemed as if my legs did not belong to me. It was almost as bad with my arms. As for my head, it seemed no longer to exist.... I appeared to myself to act automatically, by an impulsion foreign to myself.... There was inside of me a new being, and another part of myself, the old being, which took no interest in the new-comer. I distinctly remember saying to myself that the sufferings of this new being were to me indifferent. I was never really dupe of these illusions, but my mind grew often tired of incessantly correcting the new impressions, and I let myself go an lived the unhappy life of this new entity. I had an ardent desire to see my old world again, to get back to my old self. This desire kept me from killing myself.... I was another, and I hated, I despised this other; he was perfectly odious to me; it was certainly another who had taken my form and assumed my functions.""[49]<br>
<br>
In cases similar to this, it is as certain that the I is unaltered as that the me is changed. That is to say, the present Thought of the patient is cognitive of both the old me and the new, so long as its memory holds good. Only, within that objective sphere which formerly lent itself so simply to the judgment of recognition and of egoistic appropriation, strange perplexities have arisen. The present and the past both seen therein will not unite. Where is my old me? What is this new one? Are they the same? Or have I two? Such questions, answered by whatever theory the patient is able to conjure up as plausible, form the beginning of his insane life.[50]<br>
<br>
A case with which I am acquainted through Dr. C. J. Fisher of Tewksbury has possibly its origin in this way. The woman, Bridget F.,<br>
<br>
""has been many years insane, and always speaks of her supposed self as 'the rat,' asking me to 'bury the little rat,' etc. Her real self she speaks of in the third person as 'the good woman,' saying, 'The good woman knew Dr. F. and used to work for him,' etc. Sometimes she sadly asks: 'Do you think the good woman will ever come back?' She works at needlework, knitting, laundry, etc., and shows her work, saying, 'Isn't that good for only a rat?' She has, during periods of depression, hid herself under buildings, and crawled into holes and under boxes. 'She was only a rat, and wants to die,' she would say when we found her.""<br>
<br>
2. The phenomenon of altering personality in its simplest phases seems based on lapses of memory. Any man becomes, as we say, inconsistent with himself if he forgets his engagements, pledges, knowledges, and habits; and it is merely a question of degree at what point we shall say that his personality is changed. In the pathological cases known as those of double or alternate personality the lapse of memory is abrupt, and is usually preceded by a period of unconsciousness or syncope lasting a variable length of time. In the hypnotic trance we can easily produce an alteration of the personality, either by telling the subject to forget all that has happened to him since such or such a date, in which case he becomes (it may be) a child again, or by telling him he is another altogether imaginary personage, in which case all facts about himself seem for the time being to lapse from out his mind, and he throws himself into the new character with a vivacity proportionate to the amount of histrionic imagination which he possesses.[51] But in the pathological cases the transformation is spontaneous. The most famous case, perhaps, on record is that of Fèlida X., reported by Dr. Azam of Bordeaux.[52] At the age of fourteen this woman began to pass into a 'secondary' state characterized by a change in her general disposition and character, as if certain 'inhibitions,' previously existing, were suddenly removed. During the secondary state she remembered the first state, but on emerging from it into the first state she remembered nothing of the second. At the age of forty-four the duration of the secondary state (which was on the whole superior in quality to the original state) had gained upon the latter so much as to occupy most of her time. During it she remembers the events belonging to the original state, but her complete oblivion of the secondary state when the original state recurs is often very distressing to her, as, for example, when the transition takes place in a carriage on her way to a funeral, and she hasn't the least idea which one of her friends may be dead. She actually became pregnant during one of her early secondary states, and during her first state had no knowledge of how it had come to pass. Her distress at these blanks of memory is sometimes intense and once drove her to attempt suicide.<br>
<br>
To take another example, Dr. Rieger gives an account[53] of an epileptic man who for seventeen years had passed his life alternately free, in prisons, or in asylums, his character being orderly enough in the normal state, but alternating with periods, during which he would leave his home for several weeks, leading the life of a thief and vagabond, being sent to jail, having epileptic fits and excitement, being accused of malingering, etc., etc., and with never a memory of the abnormal conditions which were to blame for all his wretchedness.<br>
<br>
""I have never got from anyone,"" says Dr. Rieger, ""so singular an impression as from this man, of whom it could not be said that he had any properly conscious past at all.... It is really impossible to think one's self into such a state of mind. His last larceny had been performed in Nürnberg, he knew nothing of it, and saw himself before the court and then in the hospital, but without in the least understanding the reason why. That he had epileptic attacks, he knew. But it was impossible to convince him that for hours together he raved and acted in an abnormal way.""<br>
<br>
Another remarkable case is that of Mary Reynolds, lately republished again by Dr. Weir Mitchell.[54] This dull and melancholy young woman, inhabiting the Pennsylvania wilderness in 1811,<br>
<br>
""was found one morning, long after her habitual time for rising, in a profound sleep from which it was impossible to arouse her. After eighteen or twenty hours of sleeping she awakened, but in a state of unnatural consciousness. Memory had fled. To all intents and purposes she was as a being for the first time ushered into the world. 'All of the past that remained to her was the faculty of pronouncing a few words, and this seems to have been as purely instinctive as the wailings of an infant; for at first the words which she uttered were connected with no ideas in her mind.' Until she was taught their significance they were unmeaning sounds.<br>
<br>
""'Her eyes were virtually for the first time opened upon the world. Old things had passed away; all things had become new.' Her parents, brothers, sisters, friends, were not recognized or acknowledged as such by her. She had never seen them before, - never known them, - was not aware that such persons had been. Now for the first time she was introduced to their company and acquaintance. To the scenes by which she was surrounded she was a perfect stranger. The house, the fields, the forest, the hills, the vales, the streams, - all were novelties. The beauties of the landscape were all unexplored.<br>
<br>
""She had not the slightest consciousness that she had ever existed previous to the moment in which she awoke from that mysterious slumber. 'In a word, she was an infant, just born, yet born in a state of maturity, with a capacity for relishing the rich, sublime, luxuriant wonders of created nature.'<br>
<br>
""The first lesson in her education was to teach her by what ties she was bound to those by whom she was surrounded, and the duties devolving upon her accordingly. This she was very slow to learn, and, 'indeed, never did learn, or, at least, never would acknowledge the ties of consanguinity, or scarcely those of friendship. She considered those she had once known as for the most part strangers and enemies, among whom she was, by some remarkable and unaccountable means, transplanted, though from what region or state of existence was a problem unsolved.'<br>
<br>
""The next lesson was to re-teach her the arts of reading and writing. She was apt enough, and made such rapid progress in both that in a few weeks she had readily re-learned to read and write. In copying her name which her brother had written for her as a first lesson, she took her pen in a very awkward manner and began to copy from right to left in the Hebrew mode, as though she had been transplanted from an Eastern soil....<br>
<br>
""The next thing that is noteworthy is the change which took place in her disposition. Instead of being melancholy she was now cheerful to extremity. Instead of being melancholy she was now cheerful to extremity. Instead of being reserved she was buoyant and social. Formerly taciturn and retiring, she was now merry and jocose. Her disposition was totally and absolutely changed. While she was, in this second state, extravagantly found of company, she was much more enamoured of nature's works, as exhibited in the forests, hills, vales, and water-courses. She used to start in the morning, either on foot or horseback, and ramble until nightfall over the whole country; nor was she at all particular whether she were on a path or in the trackless forest. Her predilection for this manner of life may have been occasioned by the restraint necessarily imposed upon her by her friends, which caused her to consider them her enemies and not companions, and she was glad to keep out of their way.<br>
<br>
""She knew no fear, and as bears and panthers were numerous in the woods, and rattlesnakes and copperheads abounded everywhere, her friends told her of the danger to which she exposed herself, but it produced no other effect than to draw forth a contemptuous laugh, as she said, 'I know you only want to frighten me and keep me at home, but you miss it, for I often see your bears and I am perfectly convinced that they are nothing more than black hogs.'<br>
<br>
""One evening, after her return from her daily excursion, she told the following incident: 'As I was riding to-day along a narrow path a great black hog came out of the woods and stopped before me. I never saw such an impudent black hog before. It stood up on its hind feet and grinned and gnashed its teeth at me. I could not make the horse go on. I told him he was a fool to be frightened at a hog, and tried to whip him past, but he would not go an wanted to turn back. I told the hog to get out of the way, but he did not mind me. ""Well,"" said I, ""if you won't for words, I'll try blows;"" so I got off and took a stick, and walked up toward it. When I got pretty close by, it got down on all fours and walked away slowly and sullenly, stopping every few steps and looking back and grinning and growling. Then I got on my horse and rode on.'...<br>
<br>
""Thus it continued for five weeks, when one morning, after a protracted sleep, she awoke and was herself again. She recognized the parental, the brotherly, and sisterly ties as though nothing had happened, and immediately went about the performance of duties incumbent upon her, and which she had planned five weeks previously. Great was her surprise at the change which one night (as she supposed) had produced. Nature bore a different aspect. Not a trace was left in her mind of the giddy scenes through which she had passed. Her ram- blings through the forest, her tricks and humor, all were faded from her memory, and not a shadow left behind. Her parents saw their child; her brothers and sisters saw their sister. She now had all the knowledge that she had possessed in her first state previous to the change, still fresh and in as vigorous exercise as though no change had been. But any new acquisitions she had made, and any new ideas she had obtained, were lost to her now - yet not lost, but laid up out of sight in safe-keeping for future use. Of course her natural disposition returned; her melancholy was deepened by the information of what had occurred. All went on in the old-fashioned way, and it was fondly hoped that the mysterious occurrences of those five weeks would never be repeated, but these anticipations were not to be realized. After the lapse of a few weeks she fell into a profound sleep, and awoke in her second state, taking up her new life again precisely where she had left it when she before passed from that state. She was not now a daughter or a sister. All the knowledge she possessed was that acquired during the few weeks of her former period of second consciousness. She knew nothing of the intervening time. Two periods widely separated were brought into contact. She thought it was but one night.<br>
<br>
""In this state she came to understand perfectly the facts of her case, not from memory, but from information. Yet her buoyancy of spirits was so great that no depression was produced. On the contrary, it added to her cheerfulness, and was made the foundation, as was everything else, of mirth.<br>
<br>
""These alternations from one state to another continued at intervals of varying length for fifteen or sixteen years, but finally ceased when she attained the age of thirty-five or thirty-six, leaving her permanently in her second state. In this she remained without change for the last quarter of a century of her life.""<br>
<br>
The emotional opposition of the two states seems, however, to have become gradually effaced in Mary Reynolds:<br>
<br>
""The change from a gay, hysterical, mischievous woman, fond of jests and subject to absurd beliefs or delusive convictions, to one retaining the joyousness and love of society, but sobered down to levels of practical usefulness, was gradual. The most of the twenty-five years which followed she was as different from her melancholy, morbid self as from the hilarious condition of the early years of her second state. Some of her family spoke of it as her third state. She is described as becoming rational, industrious, and very cheerful, yet reasonably serious; possessed of a well-balanced temperament, and not having the slightest indication of an injured or disturbed mind. For some years she taught school, and in that capacity was both useful and acceptable, being a general favorite with old and young.<br>
<br>
""During these last twenty-five years she lived in the same house with the Rev. Dr. John Reynolds, her nephew, part of that time keeping house for him, showing a sound judgment and a thorough acquaintance with the duties of her position.<br>
<br>
""Dr. Reynolds, who is still living in Meadville,"" says Dr. Mitchell, ""and who has most kindly placed the facts at my disposal, states in his letter to me of January 4, 1888, that at a later period of her life she said she did sometimes seem to have a dim, dreamy idea of a shadowy past, which she could not fully grasp, and could not be certain whether it originated in a partially restored memory or in the statements of the events by others during her abnormal state.<br>
<br>
""Miss Reynolds died in January, 1854, at the age of sixty-one. On the morning of the day of her death she rose in her usual health, at her breakfast, and superintended household duties. While thus employed she suddenly raised her hands to her head and exclaimed: 'Oh! I wonder what is the matter with my head!' and immediately fell to the floor. When carried to a sofa she gasped once or twice and died.""<br>
<br>
In such cases as the preceding, in which the secondary character is superior to the first, there seems reason to think that the first one is the morbid one. The word inhibition describes its dulness and melancholy. Félida X.'s original character was dull and melancholy in comparison with that which she later acquired, and the change may be regarded as the removal of inhibitions which had maintained themselves from earlier years. Such inhibitions we all know temporarily, when we can not recollect or in some other way command our mental resources. The systematized amnesias (losses of memory) of hypnotic subjects ordered to forget all nouns, or all verbs, or a particular letter of the alphabet, or all that is relative to a certain person, are inhibitions of the sort on a more extensive scale. They sometimes occur spontaneously as symptoms of disease.[55] Now M. Pierre Janet has shown that such inhibitions when they bear on a certain class of sensations (making the subject anaesthetic thereto) and also on the memory of such sensations, are the basis of changes of personality. The anaesthetic and 'amnesic' hysteric is one person; but when you restore her inhibited sensibilities and memories by plunging her into the hypnotic trance - in other words, when you rescue them from their 'dissociated' and split-off condition, and make them rejoin the other sensibilities and memories - she is a different person. As said above (p. 203), the hypnotic trance is one method of restoring sensibility in hysterics. But one day when the hysteric anaesthetic named Lucie was already in the hypnotic trance, M. Janet for a certain reason continued to make passes over her for a full half-hour as if she were not already asleep. The result was to throw her into a sort of syncope from which, after half an hour, she revived in a second somnambulic condition entirely unlike that which had characterized her thitherto - different sensibilities, a different memory, a different person, in short. In the waking state the poor young woman was anaesthetic all over, nearly deaf, and with a badly contracted field of vision. Bad as it was, however, sight was her best sense, and she used it as a guide in all her movements. With her eyes bandaged she became entirely helpless, and like other persons of a similar sort whose cases have been recorded, she almost immediately fell asleep in consequence of the withdrawal of her last sensorial stimulus. M. Janet calls this waking or primary (one can hardly in such a connection say 'normal') state by the name of Lucie 1. In Lucie 2, her first sort of hypnotic trance, the anaesthesias were diminished but not removed. In the deeper trance, 'Lucie 3,' brought about as just described, no trace of them remained. Her sensibility became perfect, and instead of being an extreme example of the 'visual' type, she was transformed into what in Prof. Charcot's terminology is known as a motor. That is to say, that whereas when awake she had thought in visual terms exclusively, and could imagine things only by remembering how they looked, now in this deeper trance her thoughts and memories seemed to M. Janet to be largely composed of images of movement and of touch.<br>
<br>
Having discovered this deeper trance and change of personality in Lucie, M. Janet naturally became eager to find it in his other subjects. He found it in Rose, in Marie, and in Léonie; and his brother, Dr. Jules Janet, who was interne at the Salpétrière Hospital, found it in the celebrated subject Wit.... whose trances had been studied for years by the various doctors of that institution without any of them having happened to awaken this very peculiar individuality.[56]<br>
<br>
With the return of all the sensibilities in the deeper trance, these subjects turned, as it were, into normal persons. Their memories in particular grew more extensive, and hereupon M. Janet spins a theoretic generalization. When a certain kind of sensation, he says, is abolished in an hysteric patient, there is also abolished along with it all recollection of past sensations of that kind. If, for example, hearing be the anaesthetic sense, the patient becomes unable even to imagine sounds and voices, and has to speak (when speech is till possible) by means of motor or articulatory cues. If the motor sense be abolished, the patient must will the movements of his limbs by first defining them to his mind in visual terms, and must innervate his voice by premonitory ideas of the way in which the words are going to sound. The practical consequences of this law would be great, for all experiences belonging to a sphere of sensibility which afterwards became anaesthetic, as, for example, touch, would have been stored away and remembered in tactile terms, and be incontinently forgotten as soon as the cutaneous and muscular sensibility should come to be cut out in the course of disease. Memory of them would be restored again, on the other hand, as soon as the sense of touch came back. Now, in the hysteric subjects on whom M. Janet experimented, touch did come back in the state of trance. The result was that all sorts of memories, absent in the ordinary condition, came back too, and they could then go back and explain the origin of many otherwise inexplicable things in their life. One stage in the great convulsive crisis of hystero-epilepsy, for example, is what French writers call the phase des attitudes passionelles, in which the patient, without speaking or giving any account of herself, will go through the outward movements of fear, anger, or some other emotional state of mind. Usually this phase is, with each patient, a thing so stereotyped as to seem automatic, and doubts have even been expressed as to whether any consciousness exists whilst it lasts. When, however, the patient Lucie's tactile sensibility came back in the deeper trance, she explained the origin of her hysteric crisis in a great fright which she had had when a child, on a day when certain men, hid behind the curtains, had jumped out upon her; she told how she went through this scene again in all her crises; she told of her sleep-walking fits through the house when a child, and how for several months she had been shut in a dark room because of a disorder of the eyes. All these were things of which she recollected nothing when awake, because they were records of experiences mainly of motion and of touch.<br>
<br>
But M. Janet's subject Léonie is interesting, and shows best how with the sensibilities and motor impulses the memories and character will change.<br>
<br>
""This woman, whose life sounds more like an improbable romance than a genuine history, has had attacks of natural somnambulism since the age of three years. She has been hypnotized constantly by all sorts of persons from the age of sixteen upwards, and she is now forty-five. Whilst her normal life developed in one way in the midst of her poor country surroundings, her second life was passed in drawing-rooms and doctors' offices, and naturally took an entirely different direction. Today, when in her normal state, this poor peasant woman is a serious and rather sad person, calm and slow, very mild with every one, and extremely timid: to look at her one would never suspect the personage which she contains. But hardly is she put to sleep hypnotically when a metamorphosis occurs. Her face is no longer the same. She keeps her eyes closed, it is true, but the acuteness of her other senses supplies their place. She is gay, noisy, restless, sometimes insupportably so. She remains good-natured, but has acquired a singular tendency to irony and sharp jesting. Nothing is more curious than to hear her after a sitting when she has received a visit from strangers who wished to see her asleep. She gives a word-portrait of them, apes their manners, pretends to know their little ridiculous aspects and passions, and for each invents a romance. To this character must be added the possession of an enormous number of recollections, whose existence she does not even suspect when awake, for her amnesia is then complete.... She refuses the name of Léonie and takes that of Léontine (Léonie 2) to which her first magnetizers had accustomed her. 'That good woman is not myself,' she says, 'she is too stupid!' To herself, Léontine or Léonie 2, she attributes all the sensations and all the actions, is a word all the conscious experiences which she has undergone in somnambulism, and knits them together to make the history of her already long life. To Léonie 1 (as M. Janet calls the waking woman] on the other hand, she exclusively ascribes the events lived through in waking hours. I was at first struck by an important exception to the rule, and was disposed to think that there might be something arbitrary in this partition of her recollections. In the normal state Léonie has a husband and children; but Léonie 2, the somnambulist, whilst acknowledging the children as her own, attributes the husband to 'the other.' This choice, was perhaps explicable, but it followed no rule. It was not till later that I learned that her magnetizers in early days, as audacious as certain hypnotizers of recent date, had somnambulized her for her first accouchements, and that she had lapsed into that state spontaneously in the later ones. Léonie 2 was thus quite right in ascribing to herself the children - it was she who had had them, and the rule that her first trance-state forms a different personality was not broken. But it is the same with her second or deepest state of trance. When after the renewed passes, syncope, etc., she reaches the condition which I have called Léonie 3, she is another person still. Serious and grave, instead of being a restless child, she speaks slowly and moves but little. Again she separates herself from the waking Léonie 1. 'A good but rather stupid woman,' she says, 'and not me.' And she also separates herself from Léonie 2: 'How can you see anything of me in that crazy creature?' she says. 'Fortunately I am nothing for her.'""<br>
<br>
Léonie 1 knows only of herself; Léonie 2 of herself and of Léonie 1; Léonie 3 knows of herself and of both the others. Léonie 1 has a visual consciousness; Léonie 2 has one both visual and auditory; in Léonie 3 it is at once visual, auditory, and tactile. Prof. Janet thought at first that he was Léonie 3's discoverer. But she told him that she had been frequently in that condition before. A former magnetizer had hit upon her just as M. Janet had, in seeking by means of passes to deepen the sleep of Léonie 2.<br>
<br>
""This resurrection of a somnambulic personage who had been extinct for twenty years is curious enough; and in speaking to Léonie 3, I naturally now adopt the name of Léonore which was given her by her first master.""<br>
<br>
The most carefully studies case of multiple personality is that of the hysteric youth Louis V. about whom MM. Bourru and Burot have written a book.[57] The symptoms are too intricate to be reproduced here with detail. Suffice it that Louis V. had led an irregular life, in the army, in hospitals, and in houses of correction, and had had numerous hysteric anaesthesias, paralyses, and contractures attacking him differently at different times and when he lived at different places. At eighteen, at an agricultural House of Correction he was bitten by a viper, which brought on a convulsive crisis and left both of his legs paralyzed for three years. During this condition he was gentle, moral, and industrious. But suddenly at last, after a long convulsive seizure, his paralysis disappeared, and with it his memory for all the time during which it had endured. His character also changed: he became quarrelsome, gluttonous, impolite, stealing his comrades' wine, and money from an attendant, and finally escaped from the establishment and fought furiously when he was overtaken and caught. Later, when he first fell under the observation of the authors, his right side was half paralyzed and insensible, and his character intolerable; the application of metals transferred the paralysis to the left side, abolished his recollections of the other condition, and carried him psychically back to the hospital of Bicêtre where he had been treated for a similar physical condition. His character, opinions, education, all underwent a concomitant transformation. He was no longer the personage of the moment before. It appeared ere long that any present nervous disorder in him could be temporarily removed by metals, magnets, electric or other baths, etc.; and that any past disorder could be brought back by hypnotic suggestion. He also went through a rapid spontaneous repetition of his series of past disorders after each of the convulsive attacks which occurred in him at intervals. It was observed that each physical state in which he found himself, excluded certain memories and brought with it a definite modification of character.<br>
<br>
""The law of these changes,"" say the authors, ""is quite clear. There exist precise, constant, and necessary relations between the bodily and the mental state, such that it is impossible to modify the one without modifying the other in a parallel fashion.""[58]<br>
<br>
The case of this proteiform individual would seem, then, nicely to corroborate M. P. Janet's law that anaesthesias and gaps in memory go together. Coupling Janet's law with Locke's that changes of memory bring changes of personality, we should have an apparent explanation of some cases at least of alternate personality. But mere anaesthesia does not sufficiently explain the changes of disposition, which are probably due to modifications in the perviousness of motor and associative paths, co-ordinate with those of the sensorial paths rather than consecutive upon them. And indeed a glance at other cases than M. Janet's own, suffices to show us that sensibility and memory are not coupled in any invariable way.[59] M. Janet's law, true of his own cases, does not seem to hold good in all.<br>
<br>
Of course it is mere guesswork to speculate on what may be the cause of the amnesias which lie at the bottom of changes in the Self. Changes of blood-supply have naturally been invoked. Alternate action of the two hemispheres was long ago proposed by Dr. Wigan in his book on the Duality of the Mind. I shall revert to this explanation after considering the third class of alterations of the Self, those, namely, which I have called 'possessions.'<br>
<br>
I have myself become quite recently acquainted with the subject of a case of alternate personality of the 'ambu- latory' sort, who has given me permission to name him in these pages.[60] The Rev. Ansel Bourne, of Greene, R. I., was brought up to the trade of a carpenter; but, in consequence of a sudden temporary loss of sight and hearing under very peculiar circumstances, he became converted from Atheism to Christianity just before his thirtieth year, and has since that time for the most part lived the life of an itinerant preacher. He has been subject to headaches and temporary fits of depression of spirits during most of his life, and has had a few fits of unconsciousness lasting an hour or less. He also has a region of somewhat diminished cutaneous sensibility on the left thigh. Otherwise his health is good, and his muscular strength and endurance excellent. He is of a firm and self-reliant disposition, a man whose yea is yea and his nay, nay; and his character for uprightness is such in the community that no person who knows him will for a moment admit the possibility of his case not being perfectly genuine.<br>
<br>
On January 17, 1887, he drew 551 dollars from a bank in Providence with which to pay for a certain lot of land in Greene, paid certain bills, and got into a Pawtucket horse-car. This is the last incident which he remembers. He did not return home that day, and nothing was heard of him for two months. He was published in the papers as missing, and foul play being suspected, the police sought in vain his whereabouts. On the morning of March 14th, however, at Norristown, Pennsylvania, a man calling himself A. J. Brown, who had rented a small shop six weeks previously stocked it with stationery, confectionery, fruit and small articles, and carried on his quiet trade without seeming to any one unnatural or eccentric, woke up in a fright and called in the people of the house to tell him where he was. He said that his name was Ansel Bourne, that he was entirely ignorant of Norristown, that he knew nothing of shop-keeping, and that the last thing he remembered - it seemed only yesterday - was drawing the money from the bank, etc., in Providence. He would not believe that two months had elapsed. The people of the house thought him insane; and so, at first, did Dr. Louis H. Read, whom they called in to see him. But on telegraphing to Providence, confirmatory messages came, and presently his nephew, Mr. Andrew Harris, arrived upon the scene, made everything straight, and took him home. He was very weak, having lost apparently over twenty pounds of flesh during his escapade, and had such a horror of the idea of the candy-store that he refused to set foot in it again.<br>
<br>
The first two weeks of the period remained unaccounted for, as he had no memory, after he had once resumed his normal personality, of any part of the time, and no one who knew him seems to have seen him after he left home. The remarkable part of the change is, of course, the peculiar occupation which the so-called Brown indulged in. Mr. Bourne has never in his life had the slightest contract with trade. 'Brown' was described by the neighbors as taciturn, orderly in his habits, and in no way queer. He went to Philadelphia several times; replenished his stock; cooked for himself in the back shop, where he also slept; went regularly to church; and once at a prayer-meeting made what was considered by the hearers a good address, in the course of which he related an incident which he had witnessed in his natural state of Bourne.<br>
<br>
This was all that was known of the case up to June 1890, when I induced Mr. Bourne to submit to hypnotism, so as to see whether, in the hypnotic trance, his 'Brown' memory would not come back. It did so with surprising readiness; so much so indeed that it proved quite impossible to make him whilst in the hypnosis remember any of the facts of his normal life. He had heard of Ansel Bourne, but ""didn't know as he had ever met the man."" When confronted with Mrs. Bourne he said that he had ""never seen the woman before,"" etc. On the other hand, he told of his peregrinations during the lost fortnight,[61] and gave all sorts of details about the Norristown episode. The whole thing was prosaic enough; and the Brown-personality seems to be nothing but a rather shrunken, dejected, and amnesic extract of Mr. Bourne himself. He gives no motive for the wandering except that there was 'trouble back there' and he 'wanted rest.' During the trance he looks old, the corners of his mouth are drawn down, his voice is slow and weak, and he sits screening his eyes and trying vainly to remember what lay before and after the two months of the Brown experience. ""I'm all hedged in,"" he says: ""I can't get out at either end. I don't know what set me down in that Pawtucket horse-car, and I don't know how I ever left that store, or what became of it."" His eyes are practically normal, and all his sensibilities (save for tardier response) about the same in hypnosis as in waking. I had hoped by suggestion, etc., to run the two personalities into one, and make the memories continuous, but no artifice would avail to accomplish this, and Mr. Bourne's skull to-day still covers two distinct personal selves.<br>
<br>
The case (whether it contain an epileptic element or not) should apparently be classed as one of spontaneous hypnotic trance, persisting for two months. The peculiarity of it is that nothing else like it ever occurred in the man's life, and that no eccentricity of character came out. In most similar cases, the attacks recur, and the sensibilities and conduct markedly change.[62]<br>
<br>
3. In 'mediumships' or 'possessions' the invasion and the passing away of the secondary state are both relatively abrupt, and the duration of the state is usually short - i.e., from a few minutes to a few hours. Whenever the secondary state is well developed no memory for aught that happened during it remains after the primary consciousness comes back. The subject during the secondary consciousness speaks, writes, or acts as if animated by a foreign person, and often names this foreign person and gives his history. In old times the foreign 'control' was usually a demon, and is so now in communities which favor that belief. With us he gives himself out at the worst for an Indian or other grotesquely speaking but harmless personage. Usually he purports to be the spirit of a dead person known or unknown to those present, and the subject is then what we call a 'medium.' Mediumistic possession in all its grades seems to form a perfectly natural special type of alternate personality, and the susceptibility to it in some form is by no means an uncommon gift, in persons who have no other obvious nervous anomaly. The phenomena are very intricate, and are only just beginning to be studied in a proper scientific way. The lowest phase of mediumship is automatic writing, and the lowest grade of that is where the Subject knows what words are coming, but feels impelled to write them as if from without. Then comes writing unconsciously, even whilst engaged in reading or talk. Inspirational speaking, playing on musical instruments, etc., also belong to the relatively lower phases of possession, in which the normal self is not excluded from conscious participation in the performance, though their initiative seems to come from elsewhere. In the highest phase the trance is complete, the voice, language, and everything are changed, and there is no after-memory whatever until the next trance comes. One curious thing about trance-utterances is their generic similarity in different individuals. The 'control' here in America is either a grotesque, slangy, and flippant personage ('Indian' controls, calling the ladies 'squaws,' the men 'braves,' the house a 'wigwam,' etc., etc., are excessively common); or, if he ventures on higher intellectual flights, he abounds in a curiously vague optimistic philosophy-and-water, in which phrases about spirit, harmony, beauty, law, progression, development, etc., keep recurring. It seems exactly as if one author composed more than half of the trance-messages, no matter by whom they are uttered. Whether all sub-conscious selves are peculiarly susceptible to a certain stratum of the Zeitgeist, and get their inspiration from it, I know not; but this is obviously the case with the secondary selves which become 'developed' in spiritualist circles. There the beginnings of the medium trance are indistinguishable from effects of hypnotic suggestion. The subject assumes the role of a medium simply because opinion expects it of him under the conditions which are present; and carries it out with a feebleness or a vivacity proportionate to his histrionic gifts. But the odd thing is that persons unexposed to spiritualist traditions will so often act in the same way when they become entranced, speak in the name of the departed, go through the motions of their several death-agonies, send messages about their happy home in the summer-land, and describe the ailments of those present. I have no theory to publish of these cases, several of which I have personally seen.<br>
<br>
As an example of the automatic writing performances I will quote from an account of his own case kindly furnished me by Mr. Sidney Dean of Warren, R. I., member of Congress from Connecticut from 1855 to 1859, who has been all his life a robust and active journalist, author, and man of affairs. He has for many years been a writing subject, and has a large collection of manuscript automatically produced.<br>
<br>
""Some of it,"" he writes us, ""is in hieroglyph, or strange compounded arbitrary characters; each series possessing a seeming unity in general design or character, followed by what purports to be a translation or rendering into mother English. I never attempted the seemingly impossible feat of copying the characters. They were cut with the precision of a graver's tool, and generally with a single rapid stroke of the pencil. Many languages, some obsolete and passed from history, and professedly given. To see them would satisfy you that no one could copy them except by tracing.<br>
<br>
""These, however, are but a small part of the phenomena. The 'automatic' has given place to the impressional, and when the work is in progress I am in the normal condition, and seemingly two minds, intelligences, persons, are practically engaged. The writing is in my own hand but the dictation not of my own mind and will, but that of another, upon subjects of which I can have no knowledge and hardly a theory; and I, myself, consciously criticise the thought, fact, mode of expressing it, etc., while the hand is recording the subject-matter and even the words impressed to be written. If I refuse to write the sentence, or even the word, the impression instantly ceases, and my willingness must be mentally expressed before the work is resumed, and it is resumed at the point of cessation, even if it should be in the middle of a sentence. Sentences are commenced without knowledge of mine as to their subject or ending. In fact, I have never known in advance the subject of disquisition.<br>
<br>
""There is in progress now, at uncertain times, not subject to my will, a series of twenty-four chapters upon the scientific features of life, moral, spiritual, eternal. Seven have already been written in the manner indicated. These were preceded by twenty-four chapters relating generally to the life beyond material death, its characteristics, etc. Each chapter is signed by the name of some person who has lived on earth, - some with whom I have been personally acquainted, others known in history.... I know nothing of the alleged authorship of any chapter until it is completed and the name impressed and appended.... I am interested not only in the reputed authorship, - of which I have nothing corroborative, - but in the philosophy taught, of which I was in ignorance until these chapters appeared. From my standpoint of life - which has been that of biblical orthodoxy - the philosophy is new, seems to be reasonable, and is logically put. I confess to an inability to successfully controvert it to my own satisfaction.<br>
<br>
""It is an intelligent ego who writes, or else the influence assumes individuality, which practically makes of the influence a personality. It is not myself; of that I am conscious at every step of the process. I have also traversed the whole field of the claims of 'unconscious cerebration,' so called, so far as I am competent to critically examine it, and it fails, as a theory, in numberless points, when applied to this strange work through me. It would be far more reasonable and satisfactory for me to accept the silly hypothesis of re-incarnation, - the old doctrine of metempsychosis, - as taught by some spiritualists to-day, and to believe that I lived a former life here, and that once in a while it dominates my intellectual powers, and writes chapters upon the philosophy of life, or opens a post-office for spirits to drop their effusions, and have them put into English script. No; the easiest and most natural solution to me is to admit the claim made, i.e., that it is a decarnated intelligence who writes. But who? that is the question. The names of scholars and thinkers who once lived are affixed to the most ungrammatical and weakest of bosh...<br>
<br>
""It seems reasonable to me - upon the hypothesis that it is a person using another's mind or brain - that there must be more or less of that other's style or tone incorporated in the message, and that to the unseen personality, i.e., the power which impresses, the thought, the fact, or the philosophy, and not the style or tone, belongs. For instance, while the influence is impressing my brain with the greatest force and rapidity, so that my pencil fairly flies over the paper to record the thoughts, I am conscious that, in many cases, the vehicle of the thought, i.e., the language, is very natural and familiar to me, as if, somehow, my personality as a writer was getting mixed up with the message. And, again, the style, language, everything, is entirely foreign to my own style.""<br>
<br>
I am myself persuaded by abundant acquaintance with the trances of one medium that the 'control' may be altogether different from any possible waking self of the person. In the case I have in mind, if professes to be a certain departed French doctor; and is, I am convinced, acquainted with facts about the circumstances, and the living and dead relatives and acquaintances, of numberless sitters whom the medium never met before, and of whom she has never heard the names. I record my bare opinion here unsupported by the evidence, not, of course, in order to convert anyone to my view, but because I am persuaded that a serious study of these trance-phenomena is one of the greatest needs of psychology, and think that my personal confession may possibly draw a reader or two into a field which the soidisant 'scientist' usually refuses to explore.<br>
<br>
Many persons have found evidence conclusive to their minds that in some cases the control is really the departed spirit whom it pretends to be. The phenomena shade off so gradually into cases where this is obviously absurd, that the presumption (quite apart from a priori 'scientific' prejudice) is great against its being true. The case of Lurancy Vennum is perhaps as extreme a case of 'pos- session' of the modern sort as one can find.[63] Lurancy was a young girl of fourteen, living with her parents at Watseka, Ill., who (after various distressing hysterical disorders and spontaneous trances, during which she was possessed by departed spirits of a more or less grotesque sort) finally declared herself to be animated by the spirit of Mary Roff (a neighbor's daughter, who had died in an insane asylum twelve years before) and insisted on being sent 'home' to Mr. Roff's house. After a week of 'homesickness' and importunity on her part, her parents agreed, and the Roffs, who pitied her, and who were spiritualists into the bargain, took her in. Once there, she seems to have convinced the family that their dead Mary had exchanged habitations with Lurancy. Lurancy was said to be temporarily in heaven, and Mary's spirit now controlled her organism, and lived again in her former earthly home.<br>
<br>
""The girl, now in her new home, seemed perfectly happy and content, knowing every person and everything that Mary knew when in her original body, twelve to twenty-five years ago, recognizing and calling by name those who were friends and neighbors of the family from 1852 to 1865, when Mary died, calling attention to scores, yes, hundreds of incidents that transpired during her natural life. During all the period of her sojourn at Mr. Roff's she had no knowledge of, and did not recognize, any of Mr. Vennum's family, their friends or neighbors, yet Mr. and Mrs. Vennum and their children visited her and Mr. Roff's people, she being introduced to them as to any strangers. After frequent visits, and hearing them often and favorably spoken of, she learned to love them as acquaintances, and visited them with Mrs. Roff three times. From day to day she appeared natural, easy, affable, and industrious, attending diligently and faithfully to her household duties, assisting in the general work of the family as a faithful, prudent daughter might be supposed to do, singing, reading, or conversing as opportunity offered, upon all matters of private or general interest to the family.""<br>
<br>
The so-called Mary whilst at the Roffs' would sometimes 'go back to heaven,' and leave the body in a 'quiet trance,' i.e., without the original personality of Lurancy returning. After eight or nine weeks however, the memory and manner of Lurancy would sometimes partially, but not entirely, return for a few minutes. Once Lurancy seems to have taken full possession for a short time. At last, after some fourteen weeks, comformably to the prophecy which 'Mary' had made when she first assumed 'control,' she departed definitively and the Lurancy-consciousness came back for good. Mr. Roff writes:<br>
<br>
""She wanted me to take her home, which I did. She called me Mr. Roff, and talked with me as a young girl would, not being acquainted. I asked her how things appeared to her - if they seemed natural. She said it seemed like a dream to her. She met her parents and brothers in a very affectionate manner, hugging and kissing each one in tears of gladness. She clasped her arms around her father's neck a long time, fairly smothering him with kisses. I saw her father just now (eleven o'clock). He says she has been perfectly natural, and seems entirely well.""<br>
<br>
Lurancy's mother writes, a couple of months later, that she was<br>
<br>
""perfectly and entirely well and natural. For two or three weeks after her return home, she seemed a little strange to what she had been before she was taken sick last summer, but only, perhaps, the natural change that had taken place with the girl, and except it seemed to her as though she had been dreaming or sleeping, etc. Lurancy has been smarter, more intelligent, more industrious, more womanly, and more polite than before. We give the credit of her complete cure and restoration to her family, to Dr. E. W. Stevens, and Mr. and Mrs. Roff, by their obtaining her removal to Mr. Roff's, where her cure was perfected. We firmly believe that, had she remained at home, she would have died, or we would have been obliged to send her to the insane asylum; and if so, that she would have died there; and further, that I could not have lived a short time with the care and trouble devolving on me. Several of the relatives of Lurancy, including ourselves, now believe she was cured by spirit power, and that Mary Roff controlled the girl.""<br>
<br>
Eight years later, Lurancy was reported to be married and a mother, and in good health. She had apparently outgrown the mediumistic phase of her existence.[64]<br>
<br>
On the condition of the sensibility during these invasions, few observations have been made. I have found the hands of two automatic writers anaesthetic during the act. In two others I have found this not to be the case. Automatic writing is usually preceded by shooting pains along the arm-nerves and irregular contractions of the arm-muscles. I have found one medium's tongue and lips apparently insensible to pin-pricks during her (speaking) trance.<br>
<br>
If we speculate on the brain-condition during all these different perversions of personality, we see that it must be supposed capable of successively changing all its modes of action, and abandoning the use for the time being of whole sets of well organized association-paths. In no other way can we explain the loss of memory in passing from one alternating condition to another. And not only this, but we must admit that organized systems of paths can be thrown out of gear with others, so that the processes in one system give rise to one consciousness, and those of another system to another simultaneously existing consciousness. Thus only can we understand the facts of automatic writing, etc., whilst the patient is out of trance, and the false anaesthesias and amnesias of the hysteric type. But just what sort of dissociation the phrase 'thrown out of gear' may stand for, we cannot even conjecture; only I think we ought not to talk of the doubling of the self as if it consisted in the failure to combine on the part of certain systems of ideas which usually do so. It is better to talk of objects usually combined, and which are now divided between the two 'selves,' in the hysteric and automatic cases in question. Each of the selves is due to a system of cerebral paths acting by itself. If the brain acted normally, and the dissociated systems came together again, we should get a new affection of consciousness in the form of a third 'Self' different from the other two, but knowing their objects together, as the result. - After all I have said in the last chapter, this hardly needs further remark.<br>
<br>
Some peculiarities in the lower automatic performances suggest that the systems thrown out of gear with each other are contained one in the right and the other in the left hemisphere. The subjects, e.g., often write backwards, or they transpose letters, or they write mirror-script. All these are symptoms of agraphic disease. The left hand, if left to its natural impulse, will in most people write mirror-script more easily than natural script. Mr. F. W. H. Myers has laid stress on these analogies.[65] He has also called attention to the usual inferior moral tone of ordinary planchette writing. On Hughlings Jackson's principles, the left hemisphere, being the more evolved organ, at ordinary times inhibits the activity of the right one; but Mr. Myers suggests that during the automatic performances the usual inhibition may be removed and the right hemisphere set free to act all by itself. This is very likely to some extent to be the case. But the crude explanation of 'two' selves by 'two' hemispheres is of course far from Mr. Myers's thought. The selves may be more than two, and the brain-systems severally used for each must be conceived as interpenetrating each other in very minute ways.<br>
<br>
Summary. To sum up now this long chapter. The consciousness of Self involves a stream of thought, each part of which as 'I' can 1) remember those which went before, and know the things they knew; and 2) emphasize and care paramountly for certain ones among them as 'me,' and appropriate to these the rest. The nucleus of the 'me' is always the bodily existence felt to be present at the time. Whatever remembered-past-feelings resemble this present feeling are deemed to belong to the same me with it. Whatever other things are perceived to be associated with this feeling are deemed to form part of that me's experience; and of them certain ones (which fluctuate more or less) are reckoned to be themselves constituents of the me in a larger sense, - such are the clothes, the material possessions, the friends, the honors and esteem which the person receives or may receive. This me is an empirical aggregate of things objectively known. The I which knows them cannot itself be an aggregate, neither for psychological purposes need it be considered to be an unchanging metaphysical entity like the Soul, or a principle like the pure Ego, viewed as 'out of time.' It is a Thought, at each moment different from that of the last moment, but appropriative of the latter, together with all that the latter called its own. All the experiential facts find their place in this description, unencumbered with any hypothesis save that of the existence of passing thoughts or states of mind. The same brain may subserve many conscious selves, either alternate or coexisting; but by what modifications in its action, or whether ultra-cerebral conditions may intervene, are questions which cannot now be answered.<br>
<br>
If anyone urge that I assign no reason why the successive passing thoughts should inherit each other's possessions, or why they and the brain-states should be functions (in the mathematical sense) of each other, I reply that the reason, if there be any, must lie where all real reasons lie, in the total sense or meaning of the world. If there be such a meaning, or any approach to it (as we are bound to trust there is), it alone can make clear to us why such finite human streams of thought are called into existence in such functional dependence upon brains. This is as much as to say that the special natural science of psychology must stop with the mere functional formula. If the passing thought be the directly verifiable existent which no school has hitherto doubted it to be, then that thought is itself the thinker, and psychology need not look beyond. The only pathway that I can discover for bringing in a more transcendental thinker would be to deny that we have any direct knowledge of the thought as such. The latter's existence would then be reduced to a postulate, an assertion that there must be a knower correlative to all this known; and the problem who that knower is would have become a metaphysical problem. With the question once stated in these terms, the spiritualist and transcendentalist solutions must be considered as prima facie on a par with our own psychological one, and discussed impartially. But that carries us beyond the psychological or naturalistic point of view.<br>

[3] ""He who imagines commendation and disgrace not to be strong motives on men... seems little skilled in the nature and history of mankind; the greatest part whereof he shall find to govern themselves chiefly, if not solely, by this law of fashion; and so they do that which keeps them in reputation with their company, little regard the laws of God or the magistrate. The penalties that attend the breach of God's laws some, nay, most, men seldom seriously reflect on; and amongst those that do, many, whilst they break the laws, entertain thoughts of future reconciliation, and making their peace for such breaches: and as to the punishments due from the laws of the commonwealth, they frequently flatter themselves with the hope of impunity. But no man escapes the punishment of their censure and dislike who offends against the fashion and opinion of the company he keeps, and would recommend himself to. Nor is there one in ten thousand who is stiff and insensible enough to bear up under the constant dislike and condemnation of his own club. He must be of a strange and unusual constitution who can content himself to live in constant disgrace and disrepute with his own particular society. Solitude many men have sought and been reconciled to; but nobody that has the least thought or sense of a man about him can live in society under the constant dislike and ill opinion of his familiars and those he converses with. This is a burden too heavy for human sufferance: and he must be made up of irreconcilable contradictions who can take pleasure in company and yet be insensible of contempt and disgrace from his companions."" (Locke's Essay, book II. ch. XXVIII.§ 12.)<br>
<br>
[4] For some farther remarks on these feelings of movement see the next chapter.<br>
<br>
[5] Wundt's account of Self-consciousness deserves to be compared with this. What I have called 'adjustments' he calls processes of 'Apperception.' ""In this development (of consciousness) one particular group of percepts claims a prominent significance, namely, those of which the spring lies in ourselves. The images of feelings we get from our own body, and the representations of our own movements distinguish themselves from all others by forming a permanent group. As there are always some muscles in a state either of tension or of activity it follows that we never lack a sense, either dim or clear, of the positions or movements of our body.... This permanent sense, moreover, has this particularity, that we are aware of our power at any moment voluntarily to arouse any one of its ingredients. We excite the sensations of movement immediately by such impulses of the will as shall arouse the movements themselves; and we excite the visual and tactile feelings of our body by the voluntary movement of our organs of sense. So we come to conceive this permanent mass of feeling as immediately or remotely subject to our will, and call it the consciousness of ourself. This self-consciousness is, at the outset, thoroughly sensational,... only gradually the second-named of its characters, its subjection to our will, attains predominance. In proportion as the apperception of all our mental objects appears to us as an inward exercise of will, does our self-consciousness begin both to widen itself and to narrow itself at the same time. It widens itself in that every mental act, whatever comes to stand in relation to our will; and it narrows itself in that it concentrates itself more and more upon the inner activity of apperception, over against which our own body and all the representations connected with it appear as external objects, different from our proper self. This consciousness, contracted down to the process of apperception, we call our Ego; and the apperception of mental objects in general, may thus, after Leibnitz, be designated as the raising of them into our self-consciousness. Thus the natural development of self-consciousness implicitly involves the most abstract forms in which this faculty has been described in philosophy; only philosophy is fond of placing the abstract ego at the outset, and so reversing the process of development. Nor should we overlook the fact that the completely abstract ego [as pure activity], although suggested by the natural development of our consciousness, is never actually found therein. The most speculative of philosophers is incapable of disjoining his ego form those bodily feelings and images which form the incessant background of his awareness of himself. The notion of his ego as such is, like every notion, derived from sensibility, for the process of apperception itself comes to our knowledge chiefly through those feelings of tension [what I have above called inward adjustments] which accompany it.""

[11] It must be observed that the qualities of the Self thus ideally constituted are all qualities approved by my actual fellows in the first instance; and that my reason for now appealing from their verdict to that of the ideal judge lies in some outward peculiarity of the immediate case. What once was admired in me as courage has now become in the eyes of men 'impertinence'; what was fortitude is obstinacy; what was fidelity is now fanaticism. The ideal judge alone, I now believe, can read my qualities, my willingnesses, my powers, or what they truly are. My fellows, misled by interest and prejudice, have gone astray.<br>

[12] The kind of selfishness varies with the self that is sought. If it be the mere bodily self; if a man grabs the best food the warm corner, the vacant seat; if he makes room for no one, spits about, and belches in our faces, - we call it hoggishness. If it be the social self, in the form of popularity or influence, for which he is greedy, he may in material ways subordinate himself to others as the best means to his end; and in this case he is very apt to pass for a disinterested man. If it be the 'other-worldly' self which he seeks, and if he seeks it ascetically, - even though he would rather see all mankind damned eternally than lose his individual soul, - 'saintliness' will probably be the name by which his selfishness will be called.<br>

[15] Professor Bain, in his chapter on 'Emotions of Self,' does scant justice to the primitive nature of a large part of our self-feeling, and seems to reduce it to reflective self-estimation of this sober intellectual sort, which certainly most of it is not. He says that when the attention is turned inward upon self as a Personality, ""we are putting forth towards ourselves the kind of exercise that properly accompanies our contemplation of other persons. We are accustomed to scrutinize the actions and conduct of those about us, to set a higher value upon one man than upon another, by comparing the two; to pity one in distress; to feel complacency towards a particular individual; to congratulate a man on some good fortune that it pleases us to see him gain; to admire greatness or excellence as displayed by any of our fellows. All these exercises are intrinsically social, like Love and Resentment; an isolated individual could never attain to them, nor exercise them. By what means, then, through what fiction [!] can we turn round and play them off upon self? Or how comes it that we obtain any satisfaction by putting self in the place of the other party? Perhaps the simplest form of the reflected act is that expressed by Self-worth and Self-estimation, based and begun upon observation of the ways and conduct of our fellow-beings. We soon make comparisons among the individuals about us; we see that one is stronger and does more work than another, and, in consequence perhaps, receives more pay. We see one putting forth perhaps more kindness than another, and in consequence receiving more love. We see some individuals surpassing the rest in astonishing feats, and drawing after them the gaze and admiration of a crowd. We acquire a series of fixed associations towards persons so situated; favorable in the case of the superior, and unfavorable to the inferior. To the strong and laborious man we attach an estimate of greater reward, and feel that to be in his place would be a happier lot than falls to others. Desiring, as we do, from the primary motives of our being, to possess good things, and observing these to come by a man's superior exertions, we feel a respect for such exertion and a wish that it might be ours. We know that we also put forth exertions for our share of good things; and on witnessing others, we are apt to be reminded of ourselves and to make comparisons with ourselves, which comparisons derive their interest from the substantial consequences. Having thus once learned to look at other persons as performing labors, greater or less, and as realizing fruits to accord; being, moreover, in all respects like our fellows, - we find it an exercise neither difficult nor unmeaning to contemplate self as doing work and receiving the reward.... As we decide between one man and another, - which is worthier,... so we decide between self and all other men; being, however, in this decision under the bias of our own desires."" A couple of pages farther on we read: ""By the terms Self-complacency, Self-gratulation, is indicated a positive enjoyment in dwelling upon our own merits and belongings. As in other modes, so here, the starting point is the contemplation of excellence or pleasing qualities in another person, accompanied more or less with fondness or love."" Self-pity is also regarded by Professor Bain, in this place, as an emotion diverted to ourselves from a more immediate object, ""in a manner that we may term fictitious and unreal. Still, as we can view self in the light of another person, we can feel towards it the emotion of pity called forth by others in our situation.""<br>
<br>
This account of Professor Bain's is, it will be observed a good specimen of the old-fashioned mode of explaining the several emotions as rapid calculations of results, and the transfer of feeling from one object to another, associated by contiguity or similarity with the first. Zoological evolutionism, which came up since Professor Bain first wrote, has made us see, on the contrary, that many emotions must be primitively aroused by special objects. None are more worthy of being ranked primitive than the self-gratulation and humiliation attendant on our own successes and failures in the main functions of life. We need no borrowed reflection for these feelings. Professor Bain's account applied to but that small fraction of our self-feeling which reflective criticism can add to, or subtract from, the total mass. - Lotze has some pages on the modifications of our self-regard by universal judgments, in Microcosmus, book V. chap. V. § 5.<br>
<br>
[16] ""Also nur dadurch, dass ich ein Mannigfaltiges gegebener Vorstellungen in einem Bewusstsein verbinden kann, ist es möglich dass ich die Identität des Bewusstseins in diesen Vorstellungen selbst vorstelle, d. h. die analytische Einheit der Apperception ist nur unter der Voraussetzung irgend einer synthetischen möglich."" In this passage (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, 2te Aufl. § 16) Kant calls by the names of analytic and synthetic apperception what we here mean by objective and subjective synthesis respectively. It were much to be desired that some one might invent a good pair of terms in which to record the distinction - those used in the text are certainly very bad, but Kant's seem to me still worse. 'Categorical unity' and 'transcendental synthesis' would also be good Kantian, but hardly good human, speech.<br>
<br>
[17] So that we might say, by a sort of bad pun, ""only a connected world can be known as disconnected."" I say bad pun, because the point of view shifts between the connectedness and the disconnectedness. The disconnectedness is of the realities known; the connectedness is of the knowledge of them; and reality and knowledge of it are, from the psychological point of view held fast to in these pages, two different facts.<br>
<br>
[18] Some subtle reader will object that the Thought cannot call any part of its Object 'I' and knit other parts on to it, without first knitting that part on to Itself; and that it cannot knit it on to Itself without knowing Itself; - so that our supposition (above, p. 304) that the Thought may conceivably have no immediate knowledge of Itself is thus overthrown. To which the reply is that we must take care not to be duped by words. The words I and me signify nothing mysterious and unexampled - they are at bottom only names of emphasis; and Thought is always emphasizing something. Within a tract of space which it cognizes, it contrasts a here with a there; within a tract of time a now with a then; of a pair of things it calls one this, the other that. I and thou, I and it, are distinctions exactly on a par with these, - distinctions possible in an exclusively objective field of knowledge, the 'I' meaning for the Thought nothing but the bodily life which it momentarily feels. The sense of my bodily existence, however obscurely recognized as such, may then be the absolute original of my conscious selfhood, the fundamental perception that I am. All appropriations may be made to it, by a Thought not at the moment immediately cognized by itself. Whether these are not only logical possibilities but actual facts is something not yet dogmatically decided in the text.<br>

[29] His chapter on the Psychological Theory of Mind is a beautiful case in point, and his concessions there have become so celebrated that they must be quoted for the reader's benefit. He ends the chapter with these words (loc. cit. p. 247): ""The theory, therefore, which resolves Mind into a series of feelings, with a background of possibilities of feeling, can effectually withstand the most invidious of the arguments directed against it. But groundless as are the extrinsic objections, the theory has intrinsic difficulties which we have not set forth, and which it seems to me beyond the power of metaphysical analysis to remove....<br>
<br>
""The thread of consciousness which composes the mind's phenomenal life consist not only of present sensations, but likewise, in part, of memories and expectations. Now what are these? In themselves, they are present feelings, states of present consciousness, and in that respect not distinguished from sensations. They all, moreover, resemble some given sensations or feelings, of which we have previously had experience. But they are attended with the peculiarity that each of them involves a belief in more than its own present existence. A sensation involves only this; but a remembrance of sensation, even if not referred to any particular date, involves the suggestion and belief that a sensation, of which it is a copy or representation, actually existed in the past; and an expectation involves the belief, more or less positive, that a sensation or other feeling to which it directly refers will exist in the future. Nor can the phenomena involved in these two states of consciousness be adequately expressed, without saying that the belief they include is, that I myself formerly had, or that I myself, and no other, shall hereafter have, the sensations remembered or expected. The fact believed is, that the sensations did actually form, or will hereafter form, part of the self-same series of states, or thread of consciousness, of which the remembrance or expectation of those sensations is the part now present. If, therefore, we speak of the mind as a series of feelings we are obliged to complete the statement by calling it a series of feelings which is aware of itself as past and future; and we are reduced to the alternative of believing that the mind, or Ego, is something different from any series of feelings, or possibilities of them, or of accepting the paradox that something which ex hypothesi is but a series of feelings, can be aware of itself as a series.<br>
<br>
""The truth is, that we are here face to face with that final inexplicability, at which, as Sir W. Hamilton observes, we inevitably arrive when we reach ultimate facts; and in general, one mode of stating it only appears more incomprehensible than another, because the whole of human language is accommodated to the one, and is so incongruous with the other that it cannot be expressed in any terms which do not deny its truth. The real stumbling-block is perhaps not in any theory of the fact, but in the fact itself. The true incomprehensibility perhaps is, that something which has ceased, or is not yet in existence, can still be, in a manner, present; that a series of feelings, the infinitely greater part of which is past or future, can be gathered up, as it were, into a simple present conception, accompanied by a belief or reality. I think by far the wisest thing we can do is to accept the inexplicable fact, without any theory of how it takes place; and when we are obliged to speak of it in terms which assume a theory, to use them with a reservation as to their meaning.""<br>
<br>
In a later place in the same book (p. 561) Mill, speaking of what may rightly be demanded of a theorist, says: ""He is not entitled to frame a theory from one class of phenomena, extend it to another class which it does not fit, and excuse himself by saying that if we cannot make it fit, it is because ultimate facts are inexplicable."" The class of phenomena which the associationist school takes to frame its theory of the Ego are feelings unaware of each other. The class of phenomena the Ego presents are feelings of which the later ones are intensely aware of those that went before. The two classes do not 'fit,' and no exercise of ingenuity can ever make them fit. No shuffling of unaware feelings can make them aware. To get the awareness we must openly beg it by postulating a new feeling which has it. This new feeling is no 'Theory' of the phenomena, but a simple statement of them; and as such I postulate in the text the present passing Thought as a psychic integer, with its knowledge of so much that has gone before.<br>
<br>
[30] Kritik d. reinen Vernunft, 2te Aufl. § 17.<br>
<br>
[31] It must be noticed, in justice to what was said above on page 274 ff., that neither Kant nor his successors anywhere discriminate between the presence of the apperceiving Ego to the combined object, and the awareness by that Ego of its own presence and of its distinctness from what it apperceives. That the Object must be known to something which thinks, and that it must be known to something which thinks that it thinks, are treated by them as identical necessities, - by what logic, does not appear. Kant tries to soften the jump in the reasoning by saying the thought of itself on the part of the Ego need only be potential - ""the 'I think' must be capable of accompanying all other knowledge"" - but a thought which is only potential is actually no thought at all, which practically gives up the case.<br>
<br>
[32] ""As regards the soul, now, or the 'I,' the 'thinker,' the whole drift of Kant's advance upon Hume and sensational psychology is towards the demonstration that the subject of knowledge is an Agent."" (G. S. Morris, Kant's Critique, etc. (Chicago, 1882), p. 224.)<br>
<br>
[33] ""In Kant's Prolegomena,"" says II. Cohen, - I do not myself find the passage, - ""it is expressly said that the problem is not to show how experience arises (ensteht), but of what it consists (besteht)."" (Kant's Theorie d. Erfahrung (1871), p. 138.)<br>
<br>
[34] The contrast between the Monism thus reached and our own psychological point of view can be exhibited schematically thus, the terms in squares standing for what, for us, are the ultimate irreducible data of psychological science, and the vincula above it symbolizing the reductions which post-Kantian idealism performs:<br>
<br>
These reductions account for the ubiquitousness of the 'psychologist's fallacy' (bk. II. ch. I. p. 32) in the modern monistic writings. For us it is an unpardonable logical sin, when talking of a thought's knowledge (either of an object or of itself), to change the terms without warning, and, substituting the psychologist's knowledge therefor, [sic] still make as if we were continuing to talk of the same thing. For monistic idealism, this is the very enfranchisement of philosophy, and of course cannot be too much indulged in.<br>

[38] One is almost tempted to believe that the pantomime-state of mind and that of the Hegelian dialectics are, emotionally considered, one and the same thing. In the pantomime all common things are represented to happen in impossible ways, people jump down each other's throats, houses turn inside out, old women become young men, everything 'passes into its opposite' with inconceivable celerity and skill; and this, so far from producing perplexity, brings rapture to the beholder's mind. And so in the Hegelian logic, relations elsewhere recognized under the insipid name of distinctions (such as that between knower and object, many and one) must first be translated into impossibilities and contradictions, then 'transcended' and identified by miracle, ere the proper temper is induced for thoroughly enjoying the spectacle they show.<br>
<br>
[39] The reader will please understand that I am quite willing to leave the hypothesis of the transcendental Ego as a substitute for the passing Thought open to discussion on general speculative grounds. Only in this book I prefer to stick by the common-sense assumption that we have successive conscious states, because all psychologists make it, and because one does not see how there can be a Psychology written which does not postulate such thoughts as its ultimate data. The data of all natural sciences become in turn subjects of a critical treatment more refined than that which the sciences themselves accord; and so it may fare in the end with our passing Thought. We have ourselves seen (pp. 299-305) that the sensible certainty of its existence is less strong than is usually assumed. My quarrel with the transcendental Egoists is mainly about their grounds for their belief. Did they consistently propose it as a substitute for the passing Thought, did they consistently deny the latter's existence, I should respect their position more. But so far as I can understand them, they habitually believe in the passing Thought also. They seem even to believe in the Lockian stream of separate ideas, for the chief glory of the Ego in their pages is always its power to 'overcome' this separateness and unite the naturally disunited, 'synthetizing,' 'connecting,' or 'relating' the ideas together being used as synonyms, by transcendentalist writers, for knowing various objects at once. Not the being conscious at all, but the being conscious of many things together is held to be the difficult thing, in our psychic life, which only the wonder-working Ego can perform. But on what slippery ground does one get the moment one changes the definite notion of knowing an object into the altogether vague one of uniting or synthetizing the ideas of its various parts! - In the chapters on Sensation we shall come upon all this again.<br>

[40] ""When we compare the listeless inactivity of the infant, slumbering from the moment at which he takes his milky food to the moment at which he wakes to require it again, with the restless energies of that mighty being which he is to become in his maturer years, pouring truth after truth, in rapid and dazzling profusion, upon the world, or grasping in his single hand the destiny of empires, how few are the circumstances of resemblance which we can trace, of all that intelligence which is afterwards to be displayed; how little more is seen than what serves to give feeble motion to the mere machinery of life!... Every age, if we may speak of many ages in the few years of human life, seems to be marked with a distinct character. Each has its peculiar objects which excite lively affections; and in each, exertion is excited by affections, which in other periods terminate without inducing active desire. The boy finds a world in less space than that which bounds his visible horizon; he wanders over his range of field and exhausts his strength in the pursuit of objects which, in the years that follow, are seen only to be neglected; while to him the objects that are afterwards to absorb his whole soul are as indifferent as the objects of his present passions are destined then to appear.... How many opportunities must every one have had of witnessing the progress of intellectual decay, and the coldness that steals upon the once benevolent heart! We quit our country, perhaps at an early period of life, and after an absence of many years we return with all the rememberances of past pleasure which grow more tender as they approach their objects. We eagerly seek him to whose paternal voice we have been accustomed to listen with the same reverence as if its predictions had possessed oracular certainty, - who first led us into knowledge, and whose image has been constantly joined in our mind with all that veneration which does not forbid love. We find him sunk, perhaps, in the imbecility of idiotism, unable to recognize us, - ignorant alike of the past and of the future, and living only in the sensibility of animal gratification. We seek the favorite companion of our childhood, whose tenderness of heart, etc.... We find him hardened into a man, meeting us scarcely with the cold hypocrisy of dissembled friendship - in his general relations to the world careless of the misery he is not to feel. ... When we observe all this,... do we use only a metaphor of little meaning when we say of him that he is become a different person, and that his mind and character are changed? In what does the identity consist? ... The supposed test of identity, when applied to the mind in these cases, completely fails. It neither affects, nor is affected, in the same manner in the same circumstances. It therefore, if the test be a just one, is not the same identical mind."" (T. Brown: Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind, 'on Mental Identity.'<br>

[41] ""Sir John Cutler had a pair of black worsted stockings, which his maid darned so often with silk that they became at last a pair of silk stockings. Now, supposing these stockings of Sir John's endued with some degree of consciousness at every particular darning, they would have been sensible that they were the same individual pair of stockings both before and after the darning; and this sensation would have continued in them through all the succession of darnings; and yet after the last of all, there was not perhaps one thread left of the first pair of stockings: but they were grown to be silk stockings, as was said before.""

This boy, whom we shall later find instructive in many connections, was totally anaesthetic without and (so far as could be tested) within, save for the sight of one eye and the hearing of one ear.

The new feelings find no anterior series to which they can knit themselves on; the patient can neither interpret nor use them; he does not recognize them; they are unknown.

[50] Sudden alterations in outward fortune often produce such a change in the empirical me as almost to amount to a pathological disturbance of self-consciousness. When a poor man draws the big prize in a lottery, or unexpectedly inherits an estate; when a man high in fame is publicly disgraced, a millionaire becomes a pauper, or a loving husband and father sees his family perish at one fell swoop, there is temporarily such a rupture between all past habits, whether of an active or a passive kind, and the exigencies and possibilities of the new situation, that the individual may find no medium of continuity or association to carry him over from the one phase to the other of his life. Under these conditions mental derangement is no unfrequent result.<br>

Nevertheless in the latter she was as anaesthetic as when awake. (Loc. cit. p. 619.) - It does not appear that there was an important difference in the sensibility of Félida X. between her two states - as far as one can judge from M.

His confidence in the original narrative was strengthened by what he learned; and various unpublished facts were ascertained, which increased the plausibility of the spiritualistic interpretation of the phenomenon.<br>
<br>
[65] See his highly important series of articles on Automatic Writing, etc., in the Proceedings of the Soc. for Psych. Research, especially Article II (May 1885). Compare also Dr. Maudsley's instructive article in Mind, vol. XIV. p. 161, and Luys's essay, 'Sur le Dédoublement,' etc., in l'Encéphale for 1889.<br>

[Pre-Coro: Peso Pluma &amp; <i>Yng Lvcas</i>]<br>
Desafánate, loca, luego empápate<br>
De mi cuerpo mójate, usted sabe, en el Benz,  móntate<br>
¿Qué lo que? Mi bebé en el Mercedes Benz<br>
Las estrellas en el techo, ya estelar se fue<br>
<i>Pero sabes tú que esta noche estás pa' mí<br>
Ven, trépate encima 'e mí, manda la ubi, paso por ti</i><br>

[Verso 1: Yng Lvcas]<br>
No se le ha olvidado cómo la pasamos<br>
Fuimos a la disco y los dos bailamos pegados<br>
Como perros pegados, besos y un par de tragos<br>
Se quedó a mi lado y dijo: ""Creo me he enamorado""<br>
Ella fuma, ella toma<br>
Es diablita, chiquita, pero picosa<br>
Me encanta cuando el pantalón me lo roza<br>
A ella le encanta, se ve en su cara lo goza<br>
<br>
[Puente: Peso Pluma]<br>
Tiene novio y no se comporta<br>
Me dice: ""Tranqui, que la relación 'tá rota""<br>
Nuestros cuerpo' chocan y chocan<br>
Se juntan las boca', los leggings le ahorcan<br>

A special one for you<br>

Merry Christmas, darling<br>
We're apart, that's true<br>
But I can dream and in my dreams<br>
I'm Christmasing with you<br>

Holidays are joyful<br>
There's always something new<br>
But every day is a holiday<br>
When I'm near to you<br>

The lights on my tree<br>
I wish you could see<br>
I wish it every day<br>
The logs on the fire<br>
Fill me with desire<br>
To see you and to say<br>

Falei pra ela, ""Joga isso de volta e coloca essa buceta em mim"" (Yeah)<br>
<br>
[Verso 2: Travis Scott &amp; <i>Rob49</i>]<br>
Falei pra ela, ""Senta nesse pau,"" eu tô com a peça comigo<br>
E você sabe que essa vida tem estado ocupada, cara, eu tô ocupado, mano<br>
E eu venho, jogo um pacote, ela nunca me deixa sozinho (<i>Yeah</i>, yeah)<br>
Eu não dar abraços, não posso ficar até amanhã (<i>Não posso ficar até amanhã</i>)<br>
Ela é um anjo nas ruas, um demônio disfarçado (<i>Yeah</i>)<br>
Minto pra essa mina como se eu odiasse ela, transo como se eu amasse ela (<i>Transo com como se eu amasse ela)<br>
Eu sou acrobático como meu pai, eu sou do conjunto habitacional de Nova Orleans (Do conjunto habitacional de Nova Orleans)<br>
Yeah</i><br>
<br>
[Refrão: Travis Scott]<br>
Tô sentado de lado com uma bebida enquanto penso<br>
Essas vadias ficam com frio no verão, eu ando com um casaco de pele<br>
Me diga por que você faz isso, é melhor não pensar<br>
Outro cara vai fazer isso por ela, antes que você pisque<br>
Rodovia, dirigindo bem atrás de mim, tem uma frota<br>
Se ela ficar muito irritante, encontro uma praia<br>
Vadias gêmeas, vadias gêmeas<br>
Vadias gêmeas pulando de um jetski (Perfeito)<br>
<br>
[Verso 3: 21 Savage &amp; <i>Travis Scott</i>]<br>
Vadias gêmeas (21), Dracs gêmeas<br>
Glocks gêmeas, jatinhos gêmeos (21)<br>
Aviões fretados, eu não ando de propulsão<br>
Curso lento (<i>Perfeito</i>) por trás, eu tenho bebido Wock'<br>
Raios-X, tomografias, mano, pergunta pros meus inimigos (21)<br>
Dez vadias gostosas no estúdio, todas elas são adereçadas (<i>Perfeito</i>)<br>
Trato esses caras como se fossem um rádio rítmico, todos eles levam tiro<br>
Deveria ter feito uma lipo, ela tomou injeções, agora a bunda dela caiu<br>
O Slime tá sentado na cela, eu aposto que ele vai voltar pra casa igual o Pac (Por Deus, <i>perfeito</i>)<br>
Ela me chupa bem molhado, eu preciso de um esfregão<br>
Eu não quero esse boquete limpo, vadia, eu quero aquele bem babado (21)<br>

Eu uso Lanvins quando piso no quarteirão dos caras (Por Deus)<br>
Preciso de uma licença de revendedor, por causa de todos esses carros que eu comprei<br>
Eles continuam procurando pelo boquete dela, mas ela tá descendo igual a Joc (21)<br>
Oh, ele acha que é durão? Ele só tá atuando, ele é o The Rock (Yeah)<br>
Amazon Prime, me dê dois dias, eu aposto que ele cai (Cuzão)<br>

<br>
[Verso 4: Travis Scott &amp; <i>21 Savage</i>]<br>
Não é elétrico, essa merda tá cheia de gás, você consegue pegar? (Skrrt, skrrt)<br>
O jetski é do Virgil, um dos cinquenta, se liga na alavancagem (<i>Cuzão</i>)<br>
Tenho duas gêmeas, elas são de primeira linha, esse é meu fetiche favorito<br>
No fundo da garganta até ela rasgar, eu sou a bebida favorita dela (Papo reto)<br>
Fiquei sem tempo, fiz dez APs, cara, eu não posso me aposentar<br>
Estive na estrada coletando elásticos pra combinar com o traje (Yeah)<br>
Eu tenho a visão, não tem como mergulhar naquela Ayahuasca<br>
Essa merda fica mais grossa do que uma vadia com listras, eu sei que ela vai caguetar (<i>Cuzão</i>)<br>
Ayy, gêmea, liga pra sua gêmea, fala pra ela que eu tô na cidade agora (<i>21</i>)<br>
Vadia de Londres, ela quer me ver, ela mandou o endereço pra cidade da libra (<i>21</i>)<br>
Bunda enorme, quando ela anda, tem seu próprio som surround (<i>Yeah</i>)<br>
E ela tá tentando surfar em mim como se eu fosse uma onda, eu vou me afogar, me afogar<br>
Ela diz que gosta do jeito que a alma corta, isso faz ela pular, pular (<i>21</i>)<br>

Rainy days, rainy days<br>
Rainy days, I wish they would go away<br>
Rainy days, I hope the sun will come out tomorrow<br>
I don't want to drown in my sorrows<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I can't see the sun, all I see is nimbus<br>
All I feel is rain, came to pay me a visit<br>
I'm not too fond of this business<br>
God, you gon' ahead just end it<br>
It don't feel good to be in it<br>
Seconds feel like minutes<br>
Man, it was just sunny yesterday<br>
Now it's an overcast, shades of grey<br>
Singing in the rain, you can say I'm under the weather<br>
If asked ""How I'm doing"", my reply ""I've been better"", uh (uh)<br>
Rain rain go away<br>
Don't come back another day<br>
To rain on my parade, I don't want any delays to what I pray no shade<br>
Went from Sonday to Mundane<br>
Trying not to complain<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""EL AMOR DE SU VIDA""]<br>
<br>
[Verso: Payo Solís &amp; <i>Eduin Caz</i>]<br>
Si estoy tomando<br>
Es porque estoy echando alcohol a las heridas que por dentro estoy curando<br>
Si me ven abrazado de una botella<br>
O de pronto que estoy hablando con ella<br>
Puede ser que estoy pidiéndole consejos y eso es lo que estoy tomando<br>
<i>No estoy llorando<br>
Es que se están descongelando sentimientos, no son lágrimas de llanto<br>
</i><i>Si de pronto alguien de aquí tuvo un mal día<br>
Dejen que yo lеs cuente la historia mía<br>
Que sеguramente después que le cuente ya no se va a estar quejando</i><br>
<br>
[Coro: Payo Solís &amp; <i>Eduin Caz</i>]<br>
Hoy vi al amor de mi vida<br>
Tan feliz como nunca, besando al amor de su vida, yeah<br>
<i>Lo miraba de la misma forma que antes me veía<br>
Ya entendí que esta guerra la tengo perdida</i><br>
Porque el amor de mi vida<br>
Me dijeron por ahí que con otro está haciendo su vida, yeah<br>
<i>Si les digo que quiero que sea feliz, mentiría<br>
Conclusión, a ella le tengo amor y a ese le tengo envidia</i><br>
<br>
[Interludio: Julián Peña Jr. &amp; <i>Eduin Caz</i>]<br>
Y eso es Grupo Frontera<br>
<i>Y puro Grupo Firme<br>
¡Uh!</i><br>

You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch<br>
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch<br>
Your heart's an empty hole<br>
Your brain is full of spiders, you've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch<br>

You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch<br>
Given a choice between the two of you<br>
I'd take the seasick crocodile<br>

[Verse 4]<br>
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch<br>
You're a nasty-wasty skunk<br>
Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch<br>
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote, ""Stink, stank, stunk""<br>
<br>
[Verse 5]<br>
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch<br>
You're the king of sinful sots<br>
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch<br>
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable<br>
Mangled up in tangled up knots<br>
<br>
[Verse 6]<br>
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch<br>

Y que no te dé fiebre para que tú me lo entierres<br>

Introdúcela completa, rosa, bien rico aprieta<br>
Puedo ser tu puta, también tu princesa<br>
Y si te soy honesta, quiero que me chupes una teta<br>

For years and years<br>
Now I have it and damn it<br>
It‘s kind of weird</a><br>
<br>
He tells me I'm pretty<br>
Don't know how to respond<br>
I tell him that he's pretty too<br>
Can I say that? Don‘t have a clue<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
With every passing moment<br>
I surprise myself<br>
I‘m scared of flies<br>
I‘m scared of guys<br>
Someone please help<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
'Cause I think I've fallen<br>
In love this time<br>
I blinked and suddenly I had a Valentine<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
What if he's the last one I kiss?<br>
What if he's the only one I'll ever miss?<br>
Maybe I should run, I'm only twenty-one<br>
I don‘t even know who I want to become<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I've lost all control of my heartbeat now<br>
Got caught in a romance with him somehow<br>
I still feel a shock through every bone<br>
When I hear an “I love you”<br>
'Cause now I've got someone to lose<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
The first one to ever like me back<br>
I‘m seconds away from a heart attack<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
How the hell did I fall in love this time?<br>
And honestly, I can‘t believe I get to call you mine<br>
I blinked and suddenly<br>
I had a Valentine</p>

[Verso 1]<br>
Miras con tanta dulzura, hermosa criatura<br>
Tú mi bello ángel que cayó del cielo<br>
Soy un simple pobre diablo que corrió con suerte<br>
Que logró obtenerte por obra divina<br>
Pues en cada esquina te busqué<br>
<br>

Solo tú eres la persona, la que me ilusiona<br>
La que me emociona, por ti pierdo el rumbo<br>
Y en cada segundo me voy de este mundo con sentirte a ti<br>
Entre el cielo y el infierno<br>
Solo hay un еspacio, solo hay un abismo<br>
Es que yo pierdo el ritmo cuando mе abandonas<br>
Y me quedo solo, solo sin ti<br>

[Verso 2]<br>
Viniste a reconformarme, a rehabilitarme, tú mi bello ángel<br>
Yo estaba perdido<br>
Siento que después de ti yo soy otra persona, ya no me conozco<br>
¿Qué pasó conmigo?<br>
Por eso te digo que tú<br>
<br>

Solo tú eres la persona, la que me ilusiona<br>
La que me emociona, por ti pierdo el rumbo<br>

"<p>                                     <b>SEASCAPE, WITH FRIEZE OF GIRLS</b><br>
<br>
                                DINNERS AT RIVEBELLE — ENTER ALBERTINE<br>
<br>
   That day, as for some days past, Saint-Loup had been obliged to go to Doncières, where, until his leave finally expired, he would be on duty now until late every afternoon. I was sorry that he was not at Balbec. I had seen alight from carriages and pass, some into the ball-room of the Casino, others into the ice-cream shop, young women who at a distance had seemed to me lovely. I was passing through one of those periods of our youth, unprovided with any one definite love, vacant, in which at all times and in all places — as a lover the woman by whose charms he is smitten — we desire, we seek, we see Beauty. Let but a single real feature — the little that one distinguishes of a woman seen from afar or from behind — enable us to project the form of beauty before our eyes, we imagine that we have seen her before, our heart beats, we hasten in pursuit, and will always remain half-persuaded that it was she, provided that the woman has vanished: it is only if we manage to overtake her that we realise our mistake<br>
<br>
   Besides, as I grew more and more delicate, I was inclined to overrate the simplest pleasures because of the difficulties that sprang up in the way of my attaining them. Charming women I seemed to see all round me, because I was too tired, if it was on the beach, too shy if it was in the Casino or at a pastry-cook’s, to go anywhere near them. And yet if I was soon to die I should have liked first to know the appearance at close quarters, in reality of the prettiest girls that life had to offer, even although it should be another than myself or no one at all who was to take advantage of the offer. (I did not, in fact, appreciate the desire for possession that underlay my curiosity.) I should have had the courage to enter the ballroom if Saint-Loup had been with me. Left by myself, I was simply hanging about in front of the Grand Hotel until it was time for me to join my grandmother, when, still almost at the far end of the paved ‘front’ along which they projected in a discordant spot of colour, I saw coming towards me five or six young girls, as different in appearance and manner from all the people whom one was accustomed to see at Balbec as could have been, landed there none knew whence, a flight of gulls which performed with measured steps upon the sands — the dawdlers using their wings to overtake the rest — a movement the purpose of which seems as obscure to the human bathers, whom they do not appear to see, as it is clearly determined in their own birdish minds<br>
<br>
   One of these strangers was pushing as she came, with one hand, her bicycle; two others carried golf-clubs; and their attire generally was in contrast to that of the other girls at Balbec, some of whom, it was true, went in for games, but without adopting any special outfit<br>
<br>
   It was the hour at which ladies and gentlemen came out every day for a turn on the ‘front,’ exposed to the merciless fire of the long glasses fastened upon them, as if they had each borne some disfigurement which she felt it her duty to inspect in its minutest details, by the chief magistrate’s wife, proudly seated there with her back to the band-stand, in the middle of that dread line of chairs on which presently they too, actors turned critics, would come and establish themselves, to scrutinise in their turn those others who would then be filing past them. All these people who paced up and down the ‘front,’ tacking as violently as if it had been the deck of a ship (for they could not lift a leg without at the same time waving their arms, turning their heads and eyes, settling their shoulders, compensating by a balancing movement on one side for the movement they had just made on the other, and puffing out their faces), and who, pretending not to see so as to let it be thought that they were not interested, but covertly watching, for fear of running against the people who were walking beside or coming towards them, did, in fact, butt into them, became entangled with them, because each was mutually the object of the same secret attention veiled beneath the same apparent disdain; their love — and consequently their fear — of the crowd being one of the most powerful motives in all men, whether they seek to please other people or to astonish them, or to shew them that they despise them. In the case of the solitary, his seclusion, even when it is absolute and ends only with life itself, has often as its primary cause a disordered love of the crowd, which so far overrules every other feeling that, not being able to win, when he goes out, the admiration of his hall-porter, of the passers-by, of the cabman whom he hails, he prefers not to be seen by them at all, and with that object abandons every activity that would oblige him to go out of doors<br>
<br>
   Among all these people, some of whom were pursuing a train of thought, but if so betrayed its instability by spasmodic gestures, a roving gaze as little in keeping as the circumspect titubation of their neighbours, the girls whom I had noticed, with that mastery over their limbs which comes from perfect bodily condition and a sincere contempt for the rest of humanity, were advancing straight ahead, without hesitation or stiffness, performing exactly the movements that they wished to perform, each of their members in full independence of all the rest, the greater part of their bodies preserving that immobility which is so noticeable in a good waltzer. They were now quite near me. Although each was a type absolutely different from the others, they all had beauty; but to tell the truth I had seen them for so short a time, and without venturing to look them straight in the face, that I had not yet individualised any of them. Save one, whom her straight nose, her dark complexion pointed in contrast among the rest, like (in a renaissance picture of the Epiphany) a king of Arab cast, they were known to me only, one by a pair of eyes, hard, set and mocking; another by cheeks in which the pink had that coppery tint which makes one think of geraniums; and even of these points I had not yet indissolubly attached any one to one of these girls rather than to another; and when (according to the order in which their series met the eye, marvellous because the most different aspects came next one another, because all scales of colours were combined in it, but confused as a piece of music in which I should not have been able to isolate and identify at the moment of their passage the successive phrases, no sooner distinguished than forgotten) I saw emerge a pallid oval, black eyes, green eyes, I knew not if these were the same that had already charmed me a moment ago, I could not bring them home to any one girl whom I might thereby have set apart from the rest and so identified. And this want, in my vision, of the demarcations which I should presently establish between them sent flooding over the group a wave of harmony, the continuous transfusion of a beauty fluid, collective and mobile<br>
<br>
   It was not perhaps, in this life of ours, mere chance that had, in forming this group of friends, chosen them all of such beauty; perhaps these girls (whose attitude was enough to reveal their nature, bold, frivolous and hard), extremely sensitive to everything that was ludicrous or ugly, incapable of yielding to an intellectual or moral attraction, had naturally felt themselves, among companions of their own age, repelled by all those in whom a pensive or sensitive disposition was betrayed by shyness, awkwardness, constraint, by what, they would say,‘didn’t appeal’ to them, and from such had held aloof; while they attached themselves, on the other hand, to others to whom they were drawn by a certain blend of grace, suppleness, and physical neatness, the only form in which they were able to picture the frankness of a seductive character and the promise of pleasant hours in one another’s company. Perhaps, too, the class to which they belonged, a class which I should not have found it easy to define, was at that point in its evolution at which, whether thanks to its growing wealth and leisure, or thanks to new athletic habits, extended now even to certain plebeian elements, and a habit of physical culture to which had not yet been added the culture of the mind, a social atmosphere, comparable to that of smooth and prolific schools of sculpture, which have not yet gone in for tortured expressions, produces naturally and in abundance fine bodies with fine legs, fine hips, wholesome and reposeful faces, with an air of agility and guile. And were they not noble and calm models of human beauty that I beheld there, outlined against the sea, like statues exposed to the sunlight upon a Grecian shore?<br>
<br>
   Just as if, in the heart of their band, which progressed along the ‘front’ like a luminous comet, they had decided that the surrounding crowd was composed of creatures of another race whose sufferings even could not awaken in them any sense of fellowship, they appeared not to see them, forced those who had stopped to talk to step aside, as though from the path of a machine that had been set going by itself, so that it was no good waiting for it to get out of their way, their utmost sign of consciousness being when, if some old gentleman of whom they did not admit the existence and thrust from them the contact, had fled with a frightened or furious, but a headlong or ludicrous motion, they looked at one another and smiled. They had, for whatever did not form part of their group, no affectation of contempt; their genuine contempt was sufficient. But they could not set eyes on an obstacle without amusing themselves by crossing it, either in a running jump or with both feet together, because they were all filled to the brim, exuberant with that youth which we need so urgently to spend that even when we are unhappy or unwell, obedient rather to the necessities of our age than to the mood of the day, we can never pass anything that can be jumped over or slid down without indulging ourselves conscientiously, interrupting, interspersing our slow progress — as Chopin his most melancholy phrase — with graceful deviations in which caprice is blended with virtuosity. The wife of an elderly banker, after hesitating between various possible exposures for her husband, had settled him on a folding chair, facing the ‘front,’ sheltered from wind and sun by the band-stand. Having seen him comfortably installed there, she had gone to buy a newspaper which she would read aloud to him, to distract him — one of her little absences which she never prolonged for more than five minutes, which seemed long enough to him but which she repeated at frequent intervals so that this old husband on whom she lavished an attention that she took care to conceal, should have the impression that he was still quite alive and like other people and was in no need of protection. The platform of the band-stand provided, above his head, a natural and tempting springboard, across which, without a moment’s hesitation, the eldest of the little band began to run; she jumped over the terrified old man, whose yachting cap was brushed by the nimble feet, to the great delight of the other girls, especially of a pair of green eyes in a ‘dashing’ face, which expressed, for that bold act, an admiration and a merriment in which I seemed to discern a trace of timidity, a shamefaced and blustering timidity which did not exist in the others. “Oh, the poor old man; he makes me sick; he looks half dead;” said a girl with a croaking voice, but with more sarcasm than sympathy. They walked on a little way, then stopped for a moment in the middle of the road, with no thought whether they were impeding the passage of other people, and held a council, a solid body of irregular shape, compact, unusual and shrill, like birds that gather on the ground at the moment of flight; then they resumed their leisurely stroll along the ‘front,’ against a background of sea<br>
<br>
   By this time their charming features had ceased to be indistinct and impersonal. I had dealt them like cards into so many heaps to compose (failing their names, of which I was still ignorant) the big one who had jumped over the old banker; the little one who stood out against the horizon of sea with her plump and rosy cheeks, her green eyes; the one with the straight nose and dark complexion, in such contrast to all the rest; another, with a white face like an egg on which a tiny nose described an arc of a circle like a chicken’s beak; yet another, wearing a hooded cape <a href=""/8313745/Marcel-proust-seascape-with-frieze-of-girls-chapter-3/Which-gave-her-so-poverty-stricken-an-appearance-and-so-contradicted-the-smartness-of-the-figure-beneath-that-the-explanation-which-suggested-itself-was-that-this-girl-must-have-parents-of-high-position-who-valued-their-self-esteem-so-far-above-the-visitors-to-balbec-and-the-sartorial-elegance-of-their-own-children-that-it-was-a-matter-of-the-utmost-indifference-to-them-that-their-daughter-should-stroll-on-the-front-dressed-in-a-way-which-humbler-people-would-have-considered-too-modest"" data-id=""8313745"" data-editorial-state=""pending"" data-classification=""unreviewed"">(which gave her so poverty-stricken an appearance, and so contradicted the smartness of the figure beneath that the explanation which suggested itself was that this girl must have parents of high position who valued their self-esteem so far above the visitors to Balbec and the sartorial elegance of their own children that it was a matter of the utmost indifference to them that their daughter should stroll on the ‘front’ dressed in a way which humbler people would have considered too modest)</a>; a girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, colourless cheeks, a black polo-cap pulled down over her face, who was pushing a bicycle with so exaggerated a movement of her hips, with an air borne out by her language, which was so typically of the gutter and was being shouted so loud, when I passed her (although among her expressions I caught that irritating ‘live my own life’) that, abandoning the hypothesis which her friend’s hooded cape had made me construct, I concluded instead that all these girls belonged to the population which frequents the racing-tracks, and must be the very juvenile mistresses of professional bicyclists. In any event, in none of my suppositions was there any possibility of their being virtuous. At first sight — in the way in which they looked at one another and smiled, in the insistent stare of the one with the dull cheeks — I had grasped that they were not. Besides, my grandmother had always watched over me with a delicacy too timorous for me not to believe that the sum total of the things one ought not to do was indivisible or that girls who were lacking in respect for their elders would suddenly be stopped short by scruples when there were pleasures at stake more tempting than that of jumping over an octogenarian<br>
<br>
   Though they were now separately identifiable, still the mutual response which they gave one another with eyes animated by self-sufficiency and the spirit of comradeship, in which were kindled at every moment now the interest now the insolent indifference with which each of them sparkled according as her glance fell on one of her friends or on passing strangers, that consciousness, moreover, of knowing one another intimately enough always to go about together, by making them a ‘band apart’ established between their independent and separate bodies, as slowly they advanced, a bond invisible but harmonious, like a single warm shadow, a single atmosphere making of them a whole as homogeneous in its parts as it was different from the crowd through which their procession gradually wound<br>
<br>
   For an instant, as I passed the dark one with the fat cheeks who was wheeling a bicycle, I caught her smiling, sidelong glance, aimed from the centre of that inhuman world which enclosed the life of this little tribe, an inaccessible, unknown world to which the idea of what I was could certainly never attain nor find a place in it. Wholly occupied with what her companions were saying, this young girl in her polo-cap, pulled down very low over her brow, had she seen me at the moment in which the dark ray emanating from her eyes had fallen on me? In the heart of what universe did she distinguish me? It would have been as hard for me to say as, when certain peculiarities are made visible, thanks to the telescope, in a neighbouring planet, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that human beings inhabit it, that they can see us, or to say what ideas the sight of us can have aroused in their minds<br>
<br>
   If we thought that the eyes of a girl like that were merely two glittering sequins of mica, we should not be athirst to know her and to unite her life to ours. But we feel that what shines in those reflecting discs is not due solely to their material composition; that it is, unknown to us, the dark shadows of the ideas that the creature is conceiving, relative to the people and places that she knows — the turf of racecourses, the sand of cycling tracks over which, pedalling on past fields and woods, she would have drawn me after her, that little peri, more seductive to me than she of the Persian paradise — the shadows, too, of the home to which she will presently return, of the plans that she is forming or that others have formed for her; and above all that it is she, with her desires, her sympathies, her revulsions, her obscure and incessant will. I knew that I should never possess this young cyclist if I did not possess also what there was in her eyes. And it was consequently her whole life that filled me with desire; a sorrowful desire because I felt that it was not to be realised, but exhilarating, because what had hitherto been my life, having ceased of a sudden to be my whole life, being no more now than a little part of the space stretching out before me, which I was burning to cover and which was composed of the lives of these girls, offered me that prolongation, that possible multiplication of oneself which is happiness. And no doubt the fact that we had, these girls and I, not one habit — as we had not one idea — in common, was to make it more difficult for me to make friends with them and to please them. But perhaps, also, it was thanks to those differences, to my consciousness that there did not enter into the composition of the nature and actions of these girls a single element that I knew or possessed, that there came in place of my satiety a thirst — like that with which a dry land burns — for a life which my soul, because it had never until now received one drop of it, would absorb all the more greedily in long draughts, with a more perfect imbibition<br>
<br>
   I had looked so closely at the dark cyclist with the bright eyes that she seemed to notice my attention, and said to the biggest of the girls something that I could not hear. To be honest, this dark one was not the one that pleased me most, simply because she was dark and because (since the day on which, from the little path by Tansonville, I had seen Gilberte) a girl with reddish hair and a golden skin had remained for me the inaccessible ideal. But Gilberte herself, had I not loved her principally because she had appeared to me haloed with that aureole of being the friend of Bergotte, of going with him to look at old cathedrals? And in the same way could I not rejoice at having seen this dark girl look at me (which made me hope that it would be easier for me to get to know her first), for she would introduce me to the others, to the pitiless one who had jumped over the old man’s head, to the cruel one who had said “He makes me sick, poor old man!”— to all of them in turn, among whom, moreover, she had the distinction of being their inseparable companion? And yet the supposition that I might some day be the friend of one or other of these girls, that their eyes, whose incomprehensible gaze struck me now and again, playing upon me unawares, like the play of sunlight upon a wall, might ever, by a miraculous alchemy, allow to interpenetrate among their ineffable particles the idea of my existence, some affection for my person, that I myself might some day take my place among them in the evolution of their course by the sea’s edge — that supposition appeared to me to contain within it a contradiction as insoluble as if, standing before some classical frieze or a fresco representing a procession, I had believed it possible for me, the spectator, to take my place, beloved of them, among the godlike hierophants<br>
<br>
   The happiness of knowing these girls was, then, not to be realised. Certainly it would not have been the first of its kind that I had renounced. I had only to recall the numberless strangers whom, even at Balbec, the carriage bowling away from them at full speed had forced me for ever to abandon. And indeed the pleasure that was given me by the little band, as noble as if it had been composed of Hellenic virgins, came from some suggestion that there was in it of the flight of passing figures along a road. This fleetingness of persons who are not known to us, who force us to put out from the harbour of life, in which the women whose society we frequent have all, in course of time, laid bare their blemishes, urges us into that state of pursuit in which there is no longer anything to arrest the imagination. But to strip our pleasures of imagination is to reduce them to their own dimensions, that is to say to nothing. Offered me by one of those procuresses (whose good offices, all the same, the reader has seen that I by no means scorned), withdrawn from the element which gave them so many fine shades and such vagueness, these girls would have enchanted me less. We must have imagination, awakened by the uncertainty of being able to attain our object, to create a goal which hides our other goal from us, and by substituting for sensual pleasures the idea of penetrating into a life prevents us from recognising that pleasure, from tasting its true savour, from restricting it to its own range<br>
<br>
   There must be, between us and the fish which, if we saw it for the first time cooked and served on a table, would not appear worth the endless trouble, craft and stratagem that are necessary if we are to catch it, interposed, during our afternoons with the rod, the ripple to whose surface come wavering, without our quite knowing what we intend to do with them, the burnished gleam of flesh, the indefiniteness of a form, in the fluidity of a transparent and flowing azure<br>
<br>
   These girls benefited also by that alteration of social values characteristic of seaside life. All the advantages which, in our ordinary environment, extend and magnify our importance, we there find to have become invisible, in fact to be eliminated; while on the other hand the people whom we suppose, without reason, to enjoy similar advantages appear to us amplified to artificial dimensions. This made it easy for strange women generally, and to-day for these girls in particular, to acquire an enormous importance in my eyes, and impossible to make them aware of such importance as I might myself possess<br>
<br>
   But if there was this to be said for the excursion of the little band, that it was but an excerpt from the innumerable flight of passing women, which had always disturbed me, their flight was here reduced to a movement so slow as to approach immobility. Now, precisely because, in a phase so far from rapid, faces no longer swept past me in a whirlwind, but calm and distinct still appeared beautiful, I was prevented from thinking as I had so often thought when Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage bore me away that, at closer quarters, if I had stopped for a moment, certain details, a pitted skin, drooping nostrils, a silly gape, a grimace of a smile, an ugly figure might have been substituted, in the face and body of the woman, for those that I had doubtless imagined; for there had sufficed a pretty outline, a glimpse of a fresh complexion, for me to add, in entire good faith, a fascinating shoulder, a delicious glance of which I carried in my mind for ever a memory or a preconceived idea, these rapid decipherings of a person whom we see in motion exposing us thus to the same errors as those too rapid readings in which, on a single syllable and without waiting to identify the rest, we base instead of the word that is in the text a wholly different word with which our memory supplies us. It could not be so with me now. I had looked well at them all; each of them I had seen, not from every angle and rarely in full face, but all the same in two or three aspects different enough to enable me to make either the correction or the verification, to take a ‘proof of the different possibilities of line and colour that are hazarded at first sight, and to see persist in them, through a series of expressions, something unalterably material. I could say to myself with conviction that neither in Paris nor at Balbec, in the most favourable hypotheses of what might have happened, even if I had been able to stop and talk to them, the passing women who had caught my eye, had there ever been one whose appearance, followed by her disappearance without my having managed to know her, had left me with more regret than would these, had given me the idea that her friendship might be a thing so intoxicating. Never, among actresses nor among peasants nor among girls from a convent school had I beheld anything so beautiful, impregnated with so much that was unknown, so inestimably precious, so apparently inaccessible. They were, of the unknown and potential happiness of life, an illustration so delicious and in so perfect a state that it was almost for intellectual reasons that I was desperate with the fear that I might not be able to make, in unique conditions which left no room for any possibility of error, proper trial of what is the most mysterious thing that is offered to us by the beauty which we desire and console ourselves for never possessing, by demanding pleasure — as Swann had always refused to do before Odette’s day — from women whom we have not desired, so that, indeed, we die without having ever known what that other pleasure was. No doubt it was possible that it was not in reality an unknown pleasure, that on a close inspection its mystery would dissipate and vanish, that it was no more than a projection, a mirage of desire. But in that case I could blame only the compulsion of a law of nature — which if it applied to these girls would apply to all — and not the imperfection of the object. For it was that which I should have chosen above all others, feeling quite certain, with a botanist’s satisfaction, that it was not possible to find collected anywhere rarer specimens than these young flowers who were interrupting at this moment before my eyes the line of the sea with their slender hedge, like a bower of Pennsylvania roses adorning a garden on the brink of a cliff, between which is contained the whole tract of ocean crossed by some steamer, so slow in gliding along the blue and horizontal line that stretches from one stem to the next that an idle butterfly, dawdling in the cup of a flower which the moving hull has long since passed, can, if it is to fly and be sure of arriving before the vessel, wait until nothing but the tiniest slice of blue still separates the questing prow from the first petal of the flower towards which it is steering<br>
<br>
   I went indoors because I was to dine at Rivebelle with Robert, and my grandmother insisted that on those evenings, before going out, I must lie down for an hour on my bed, a rest which the Balbec doctor presently ordered me to extend to the other evenings also<br>
<br>
   However, there was no need, when one went indoors, to leave the ‘front’ and to enter the hotel by the hall, that is to say from behind. By virtue of an alteration of the clock which reminded me of those Saturdays when, at Combray, we used to have luncheon an hour earlier, now with summer at the full the days had become so long that the sun was still high in the heavens, as though it were only tea-time, when the tables were being laid for dinner in the Grand Hotel. And so the great sliding windows were kept open from the ground. I had but to step across a low wooden sill to find myself in the dining-room, through which I walked and straight across to the lift<br>
<br>
   As I passed the office I addressed a smile to the manager, and with no shudder of disgust gathered one for myself from his face which, since I had been at Balbec, my comprehensive study of it was injecting and transforming, little by little, like a natural history preparation. His features had become familiar to me, charged with a meaning that was of no importance but still intelligible, like a script which one can read, and had ceased in any way to resemble these queer, intolerable characters which his face had presented to me on that first day, when I had seen before me a personage now forgotten, or, if I succeeded in recalling him, unrecognisable, difficult to identify with this insignificant and polite personality of which the other was but a caricature, a hideous and rapid sketch. Without either the shyness or the sadness of the evening of my arrival I rang for the attendant, who no longer stood in silence while I rose by his side in the lift as in a mobile thoracic cage propelled upwards along its ascending pillar, but repeated:<br>
<br>
    “There aren’t the people now there were a month back. They’re beginning to go now; the days are drawing in.” He said this not because there was any truth in it but because, having an engagement, presently, for a warmer part of the coast, he would have liked us all to leave, so that the hotel could be shut up and he have a few days to himself before ‘rejoining’ in his new place. ‘Rejoin’ and ‘new’ were not, by the way, incompatible terms, since, for the lift-boy,‘rejoin’ was the usual form of the verb ‘to join.’ The only thing that surprised me was that he condescended to say ‘place,’ for he belonged to that modern proletariat which seeks to efface from our language every trace of the rule of domesticity. A moment later, however, he informed me that in the ‘situation’ which he was about to ‘rejoin,’ he would have a smarter ‘tunic’ and a better ‘salary,’ the words ‘livery’ and ‘wages’ sounding to him obsolete and unseemly. And as, by an absurd contradiction, the vocabulary has, through thick and thin, among us ‘masters,’ survived the conception of inequality, I was always failing to understand what the lift-boy said. For instance, the only thing that interested me was to know whether my grandmother was in the hotel. Now, forestalling my questions, the lift-boy would say to me: “That lady has just gone out from your rooms.” I was invariably taken in; I supposed that he meant my grandmother. “No, that lady; I think she’s an employee of yours.” As in the old speech of the middle classes, which ought really to be done away with, a cook is not called an employee, I thought for a moment: “But he must be mistaken. We don’t own a factory; we haven’t any employees.” Suddenly I remembered that the title of ‘employee’ is, like the wearing of a moustache among waiters, a sop to their self-esteem given to servants, and realised that this lady who had just gone out must be Françoise (probably on a visit to the coffee-maker, or to watch the Belgian lady’s little maid at her sewing), though even this sop did not satisfy the lift-boy, for he would say quite naturally, speaking pityingly of his own class, ‘with the working man’ or ‘the small person,’ using the same singular form as Racine when he speaks of ‘the poor.’ But as a rule, for my zeal and timidity of the first evening were now things of the past, I no longer spoke to the lift-boy. It was he now who stood there and received no answer during the short journey on which he threaded his way through the hotel, hollowed out inside like a toy, which extended round about us, floor by floor, the ramifications of its corridors in the depths of which the light grew velvety, lost its tone, diminished the communicating doors, the steps of the service stairs which it transformed into that amber haze, unsubstantial and mysterious as a twilight, in which Rembrandt picks out here and there a window-sill or a well-head. And on each landing a golden light reflected from the carpet indicated the setting sun and the lavatory window<br>
<br>
   I asked myself whether the girls I had just seen lived at Balbec, and who they could be. When our desire is thus concentrated upon a little tribe of humanity which it singles out from the rest, everything that can be associated with that tribe becomes a spring of emotion and then of reflexion. I had heard a lady say on the ‘front’: “She is a friend of the little Simonet girl” with that self-important air of inside knowledge, as who should say: “He is the inseparable companion of young La Rochefoucauld.” And immediately she had detected on the face of the person to whom she gave this information a curiosity to see more of the favoured person who was ‘a friend of the little Simonet.’ A privilege, obviously, that did not appear to be granted to all the world. For aristocracy is a relative state. And there are plenty of inexpensive little holes and corners where the son of an upholsterer is the arbiter of fashion and reigns over a court like any young Prince of Wales. I have often since then sought to recall how it first sounded for me there on the beach, that name of Simonet, still quite indefinite as to its form, which I had failed to distinguish, and also as to its significance, to the designation by it of such and such a person, or perhaps of some one else; imprinted, in fact, with that vagueness, that novelty which we find so moving in the sequel, when the name whose letters are every moment engraved more deeply on our hearts by our incessant thought of them has become (though this was not to happen to me with the name of the ‘little Simonet’ until several years had passed) the first coherent sound that comes to our lips, whether on waking from sleep or on recovering from a swoon, even before the idea of what o’clock it is or of where we are, almost before the word ‘I,’ as though the person whom it names were more ‘we’ even than we ourselves, and as though after a brief spell of unconsciousness the phase that is the first of all to dissolve is that in which we were not thinking of her. I do not know why I said to myself from the first that the name Simonet must be that of one of the band of girls; from that moment I never ceased to ask myself how I could get to know the Simonet family, get to know them, moreover, through people whom they considered superior to themselves (which ought not to be difficult if the girls were only common little ‘bounders’) so that they might not form a disdainful idea of me. For one cannot have a perfect knowledge, one cannot effect the complete absorption of a person who disdains one, so long as one has not overcome her disdain. And since, whenever the idea of women who are so different from us penetrates our senses, unless we are able to forget it or the competition of other ideas eliminates it, we know no rest until we have converted those aliens into something that is compatible with ourself, our heart being in this respect endowed with the same kind of reaction and activity as our physical organism, which cannot abide the infusion of any foreign body into its veins without at once striving to digest and assimilate it: the little Simonet must be the prettiest of them all — she who, I felt moreover, might yet become my mistress, for she was the only one who, two or three times half-turning her head, had appeared to take cognisance of my fixed stare. I asked the lift-boy whether he knew of any people at Balbec called Simonet. Not liking to admit that there was anything which he did not know, he replied that he seemed to have heard the name somewhere. As we reached the highest landing I told him to have the latest lists of visitors sent up to me<br>
<br>
   I stepped out of the lift, but instead of going to my room I made my way farther along the corridor, for before my arrival the valet in charge of the landing, despite his horror of draughts, had opened the window at the end, which instead of looking out to the sea faced the hill and valley inland, but never allowed them to be seen, for its panes, which were made of clouded glass, were generally closed. I made a short ‘station’ in front of it, time enough just to pay my devotions to the view which for once it revealed over the hill against which the back of the hotel rested, a view that contained but a solitary house, planted in the middle distance, though the perspective and the evening light in which I saw it, while preserving its mass, gave it a sculptural beauty and a velvet background, as though to one of those architectural works in miniature, tiny temples or chapels wrought in gold and enamels, which serve as reliquaries and are exposed only on rare and solemn days for the veneration of the faithful. But this moment of adoration had already lasted too long, for the valet, who carried in one hand a bunch of keys and with the other saluted me by touching his verger’s skull-cap, though without raising it, on account of the pure, cool evening air, came and drew together, like those of a shrine, the two sides of the window, and so shut off the minute edifice, the glistening relic from my adoring gaze. I went into my room. Regularly, as the season advanced, the picture that I found there in my window changed. At first it was broad daylight, and dark only if the weather was bad: and then, in the greenish glass which it distended with the curve of its round waves, the sea, set among the iron uprights of my window like a piece of stained glass in its leads, ravelled out over all the deep rocky border of the bay little plumed triangles of an unmoving spray delineated with the delicacy of a feather or a downy breast from Pisanello’s pencil, and fixed in that white, unalterable, creamy enamel which is used to depict fallen snow in Gallé‘s glass<br>
<br>
   Presently the days grew shorter and at the moment when I entered my room the violet sky seemed branded with the stiff, geometrical, travelling, effulgent figure of the sun (like the representation of some miraculous sign, of some mystical apparition) leaning over the sea from the hinge of the horizon as a sacred picture leans over a high altar, while the different parts of the western sky exposed in the glass fronts of the low mahogany bookcases that ran along the walls, which I carried back in my mind to the marvellous painting from which they had been detached, seemed like those different scenes which some old master executed long ago for a. confraternity upon a shrine, whose separate panels are now exhibited side by side upon the wall of a museum gallery, so that the visitor’s imagination alone can restore them to their place on the predella of the reredos. A few weeks later, when I went upstairs, the sun had already set. Like the one that I used to see at Combray, behind the Calvary, when I was coming home from a walk and looking forward to going down to the kitchen before dinner, a band of red sky over the sea, compact and clear-cut as a layer of aspic over meat, then, a little later, over a sea already cold and blue like a grey mullet, a sky of the same pink as the salmon that we should presently be ordering at Rivebelle reawakened the pleasure which I was to derive from the act of dressing to go out to dinner. Over the sea, quite near the shore, were trying to rise, one beyond another, at wider and wider intervals, vapours of a pitchy blackness but also of the polish and consistency of agate, of a visible weight, so much so that the highest among them, poised at the end of their contorted stem and overreaching the centre of gravity of the pile that had hitherto supported them, seemed on the point of bringing down in ruin this lofty structure already half the height of the sky, and of precipitating it into the sea. The sight of a ship that was moving away like a nocturnal traveller gave me the same impression that I had had in the train of being set free from the necessity of sleep and from confinement in a bedroom. Not that I felt myself a prisoner in the room in which I now was, since in another hour I should have left it and be getting into the carriage. I threw myself down on the bed; and, just as if I had been lying in a berth on board one of those steamers which I could see quite near to me and which, when night came, it would be strange to see stealing slowly out into the darkness, like shadowy and silent but unsleeping swans, I was on all sides surrounded by pictures of the sea<br>
<br>
   But as often as not they were, indeed, only pictures; I forgot that below their coloured expanse was hollowed the sad desolation of the beach, travelled by the restless evening breeze whose breath I had so anxiously felt on my arrival at Balbec; besides, even in my room, being wholly taken up with thoughts of the girls whom I had seen go past, I was no longer in a state of mind calm or disinterested enough to allow the formation of any really deep impression of beauty. The anticipation of dinner at Rivebelle made my mood more frivolous still, and my mind, dwelling at such moments upon the surface of the body which I was going to dress up so as to try to appear as pleasing as possible in the feminine eyes which would be scrutinising me in the brilliantly lighted restaurant, was incapable of putting any depth behind the colour of things. And if, beneath my window, the unwearying, gentle flight of sea-martins and swallows had not arisen like a playing fountain, like living fireworks, joining the intervals between their soaring rockets with the motionless white streaming lines of long horizontal wakes of foam, without the charming miracle of this natural and local phenomenon, which brought into touch with reality the scenes that I had before my eyes, I might easily have believed that they were no more than a selection, made afresh every day, of paintings which were shewn quite arbitrarily in the place in which I happened to be and without having any necessary connexion with that place. At one time it was an exhibition of Japanese colour-prints: beside the neat disc of sun, red and round as the moon, a yellow cloud seemed a lake against which black swords were outlined like the trees upon its shore; a bar of a tender pink which I had never seen again after my first paint-box swelled out into a river on either bank of which boats seemed to be waiting high and dry for some one to push them down and set them afloat. And with the contemptuous, bored, frivolous glance of an amateur or a woman hurrying through a picture gallery between two social engagements, I would say to myself: “Curious sunset, this; it’s different from what they usually are but after all I’ve seen them just as fine, just as remarkable as this.” I had more pleasure on evenings when a ship, absorbed and liquefied by the horizon so much the same in colour as herself (an Impressionist exhibition this time) that it seemed to be also of the same matter, appeared as if some one had simply cut out with a pair of scissors her bows and the rigging in which she tapered into a slender filigree from the vaporous blue of the sky. Sometimes the ocean filled almost the whole of my window, when it was enlarged and prolonged by a band of sky edged at the top only by a line that was of the same blue as the sea, so that I supposed it all to be still sea, and the change in colour due only to some effect of light and shade. Another day the sea was painted only in the lower part of the window, all the rest of which was so filled with innumerable clouds, packed one against another in horizontal bands, that its panes seemed to be intended, for some special purpose or to illustrate a special talent of the artist, to present a ‘Cloud Study,’ while the fronts of the various bookcases shewing similar clouds but in another part of the horizon and differently coloured by the light, appeared to be offering as it were the repetition — of which certain of our contemporaries are so fond — of one and the same effect always observed at different hours but able now in the immobility of art to be seen all together in a single room, drawn in pastel and mounted under glass. And sometimes to a sky and sea uniformly grey a rosy touch would be added with an exquisite delicacy, while a little butterfly that had gone to sleep at the foot of the window seemed to be attaching with its wings at the corner of this ‘Harmony in Grey and Pink’ in the Whistler manner the favourite signature of the Chelsea master. The pink vanished; there was nothing now left to look at. I rose for a moment and before lying down again drew dose the inner curtains. Above them I could see from my bed the ray of light that still remained, growing steadily fainter and thinner, but it was without any feeling of sadness, without any regret for its passing that I thus allowed to die above the curtains the hour at which, as a rule, I was seated at table, for I knew that this day was of another kind than ordinary days, longer, like those arctic days which night interrupts for a few minutes only; I knew that from the chrysalis of the dusk was preparing to emerge, by a radiant metamorphosis, the dazzling light of the Rivebelle restaurant. I said to myself: “It is time”; I stretched myself on the bed, and rose, and finished dressing; and I found a charm in these idle moments, lightened of every material burden, in which while down below the others were dining I was employing the forces accumulated during the inactivity of this last hour of the day only in drying my washed body, in putting on a dinner jacket, in tying my tie, in making all those gestures which were already dictated by the anticipated pleasure of seeing again some woman whom I had noticed, last time, at Rivebelle, who had seemed to be watching me, had perhaps left the table for a moment only in the hope that I would follow her; it was with joy that I enriched myself with all these attractions so as to give myself, whole, alert, willing, to a new life, free, without cares, in which I would lean my hesitations upon the calm strength of Saint-Loup, and would choose from among the different species of animated nature and the produce of every land those which, composing the unfamiliar dishes that my companion would at once order, might have tempted my appetite or my imagination. And then at the end of the season came the days when I could no longer pass indoors from the ‘front’ through the dining-room; its windows stood open no more, for it was night now outside and the swarm of poor folk and curious idlers, attracted by the blaze of light which they might not reach, hung in black clusters chilled by the north wind to the luminous sliding walls of that buzzing hive of glass<br>
<br>
   There was a knock at my door; it was Aimé who had come upstairs in person with the latest lists of visitors<br>
<br>
   Aimé could not go away without telling me that Dreyfus was guilty a thousand times over. “It will all come out,” he assured me, “not this year, but next. It was a gentleman who’s very thick with the General Staff, told me. I asked him if they wouldn’t decide to bring it all to light at once, before the year is out. He laid down his cigarette,” Aimé went on, acting the scene for my benefit, and, shaking his head and his forefinger as his informant had done, as much as to say: “We mustn’t expect too much!”—”‘Not this year, Aimé,’ those were his very words, putting his hand on my shoulder, ‘It isn’t possible. But next Easter, yes!’” And Aimé tapped me gently on my shoulder, saying, “You see, I’m letting you have it exactly as he told me,” whether because he was flattered at this act of familiarity by a distinguished person or so that I might better appreciate, with a full knowledge of the facts, the worth of the arguments and our grounds for hope<br>
<br>
   It was not without a slight throb of the heart that on the first page of the list I caught sight of the words ‘Simonet and family.’ I had in me a store of old dream-memories which dated from my childhood, and in which all the tenderness (tenderness that existed in my heart, but, when my heart felt it, was not distinguishable from anything else) was wafted to me by a person as different as possible from myself. This person, once again I fashioned her, utilising for the purpose the name Simonet and the memory of the harmony that had reigned between the young bodies which I had seen displaying themselves on the beach, in a sportive procession worthy of Greek art or of Giotto. I knew not which of these girls was Mlle. Simonet, if indeed any of them were so named, but I did know that I was loved by Mlle. Simonet and that I was going, with Saint-Loup’s help, to attempt to know her. Unfortunately, having on that condition only obtained an extension of his leave, he was obliged to report for duty every day at Doncières: but to make him forsake his military duty I had felt that I might count, more even than on his friendship for myself, on that same curiosity, as a human naturalist, which I myself had so often felt — even without having seen the person mentioned, and simply on hearing some one say that there was a pretty cashier at a fruiterer’s — to acquaint myself with a new variety of feminine beauty. But that curiosity I had been wrong in hoping to excite in Saint-Loup by speaking to him of my band of girls. For it had been and would long remain paralysed in him by his love for that actress whose lover he was. And even if he had felt it lightly stirring him he would have repressed it, from an almost superstitious belief that on his own fidelity might depend that of his mistress. And so it was without any promise from him that he would take an active interest in my girls that we started out to dine at Rivebelle<br>
<br>
   At first, when we arrived there, the sun used just to have set, but it was light still; in the garden outside the restaurant, where the lamps had not yet been lighted, the heat of the day fell and settled, as though in a vase along the sides of which the transparent, dusky jelly of the air seemed of such consistency that a tall rose-tree fastened against the dim wall which it streaked with pink veins, looked like the arborescence that one sees at the heart of an onyx. Presently night had always fallen when we left the carriage, often indeed before we started from Balbec if the evening was wet and we had put off sending for the carriage in the hope of the weather’s improving. But on those days it was without any sadness that I listened to the wind howling, I knew that it did not mean the abandonment of my plans, imprisonment in my bedroom; I knew that in the great dining-room of the restaurant, which we would enter to the sound of the music of the gypsy band, the innumerable lamps would triumph easily over darkness and chill, by applying to them their broad cauteries of molten gold, and I jumped light-heartedly after Saint-Loup into the closed carriage which stood waiting for us in the rain. For some time past the words of Bergotte, when he pronounced himself positive that, in spite of all I might say, I had been created to enjoy, pre-eminently, the pleasures of the mind, had restored to me, with regard to what I might succeed in achieving later on, a hope that was disappointed afresh every day by the boredom that I felt on setting myself down before a writing-table to start work on a critical essay or a novel. “After all,” I said to myself, “possibly the pleasure that its author has found in writing it is not the infallible test of the literary value of a page; it may be only an accessory, one that is often to be found superadded to that value, but the want of which can have no prejudicial effect on it. Perhaps some of the greatest masterpieces were written yawning.” My grandmother set my doubts at rest by telling me that I should be able to work and should enjoy working as soon as my health improved. And, our doctor having thought it only prudent to warn me of the grave risks to which my state of health might expose me, and having outlined all the hygienic precaution that I ought to take to avoid any accident — I subordinated all my pleasures to an object which I judged to be infinitely more important than them, that of becoming strong enough to be able to bring into being the work which I had, possibly, within me; I had been exercising over myself, ever since I had come to Balbec, a scrupulous and constant control. Nothing would have induced me, there, to touch the cup of coffee which would have robbed me of the night’s sleep that was necessary if I was not to be tired next day. But as soon as we reached Rivebelle, immediately, what with the excitement of a new pleasure, and finding myself in that different zone into which the exception to our rule of life takes us after it has cut the thread, patiently spun throughout so many days, that was guiding us towards wisdom — as though there were never to be any such thing as to-morrow, nor any lofty aims to be realised, vanished all that exact machinery of prudent hygienic measures which had been working to safeguard them. A waiter was offering to take my coat, whereupon Saint-Loup asked: “You’re sure you won’t be cold? Perhaps you’d better keep it: it’s not very warm in here.”<br>
<br>
    “No, no,” I assured him; and perhaps I did not feel the cold; but however that might be, I no longer knew the fear of falling ill, the necessity of not dying, the importance of work. I gave up my coat; we entered the dining-room to the sound of some warlike march played by the gipsies, we advanced between two rows of tables laid for dinner as along an easy path of glory, and, feeling a happy glow imparted to our bodies by the rhythms of the orchestra which rendered us its military honours, gave us this unmerited triumph, we concealed it beneath a grave and frozen mien, beneath a languid, casual gait, so as not to be like those music-hall ‘mashers’ who, having wedded a ribald verse to a patriotic air, come running on to the stage with the martial countenance of a victorious general<br>
<br>
   From that moment I was a new man, who was no longer my grandmother’s grandson and would remember her only when it was time to get up and go, but the brother, for the time being, of the waiters who were going to bring us our dinner<br>

   The dose of beer — all the more, that of champagne — which at Balbec I should not have ventured to take in a week, albeit to my calm and lucid consciousness the flavour of those beverages represented a pleasure clearly appreciable, since it was also one that could easily be sacrificed, I now imbibed at a sitting, adding to it a few drops of port wine, too much distracted to be able to taste it, and I gave the violinist who had just been playing the two louis which I had been saving up for the last month with a view to buying something, I could not remember what. Several of the waiters, set going among the tables, were flying along at full speed, each carrying on his outstretched palms a dish which it seemed to be the object of this kind of race not to let fall. And in fact the chocolate soufflés arrived at their destination unspilled, the potatoes à l’anglaise, in spite of the pace which ought to have sent them flying, came arranged as at the start round the Pauilhac lamb. I noticed one of these servants, very tall, plumed with superb black locks, his face dyed in a tint that suggested rather certain species of rare birds than a human being, who, running without pause (and, one would have said, without purpose) from one end of the room to the other, made me think of one of those macaws which fill the big aviaries in zoological gardens with their gorgeous colouring and incomprehensible agitation. Presently the spectacle assumed an order, in my eyes at least, growing at once more noble and more calm. All this dizzy activity became fixed in a quiet harmony. I looked at the round tables whose innumerable assemblage filled the restaurant like so many planets as planets are represented in old allegorical pictures. Moreover, there seemed to be some irresistibly attractive force at work among these divers stars, and at each table the diners had eyes only for the tables at which they were not sitting, except perhaps some wealthy amphitryon who, having managed to secure a famous author, was endeavouring to extract from him, thanks to the magic properties of the turning table, a few unimportant remarks at which the ladies marvelled. The harmony of these astral tables did not prevent the incessant revolution of the countless servants who, because instead of being seated like the diners they were on their feet, performed their evolutions in a more exalted sphere. No doubt they were running, one to fetch the hors d’oeuvres, another to change the wine or with clean glasses. But despite these special reasons, their perpetual course among the round tables yielded, after a time, to the observer the law of its dizzy but ordered circulation. Seated behind a bank of flowers, two horrible cashiers, busy with endless calculations, seemed two witches occupied in forecasting by astrological signs the disasters that might from time to time occur in this celestial vault fashioned according to the scientific conceptions of the middle ages<br>
<br>
   And I rather pitied all the diners because I felt that for them the round tables were not planets and that they had not cut through the scheme of things one of those sections which deliver us from the bondage of appearances and enable us to perceive analogies. They thought that they were dining with this or that person, that the dinner would cost roughly so much, and that to-morrow they would begin all over again. And they appeared absolutely unmoved by the progress through their midst of a train of young assistants who, having probably at that moment no urgent duty, advanced processionally bearing rolls of bread in baskets. Some of them, the youngest, stunned by the cuffs which the head waiters administered to them as they passed, fixed melancholy eyes upon a distant dream and were consoled only if some visitor from the Balbec hotel in which they had once been employed, recognising them, said a few words to them, telling them in person to take away the champagne which was not fit to drink, an order that filled them with pride<br>
<br>
   I could hear the twinging of my nerves, in which there was a sense of comfort independent of the external objects that might have produced it, a comfort which the least shifting of my body or of my attention was enough to make me feel, just as to a shut eye a slight pressure gives the sensation of colour. I had already drunk a good deal of port wine, and if I now asked for more it was not so much with a view to the comfort which the additional glasses would bring me as an effect of the comfort produced by the glasses that had gone before. I allowed the music itself to guide to each of its notes my pleasure which, meekly following, rested on each in turn. If, like one of those chemical industries by means of which are prepared in large quantities bodies which in a state of nature come together only by accident and very rarely, this restaurant at Rivebelle united at one and the same moment more women to tempt me with beckoning vistas of happiness than the hazard of walks and drives would have made me encounter in a year; on the other hand, this music that greeted our ears — arrangements of waltzes, of German operettas, of music-hall songs, all of them quite new to me — was itself like an ethereal resort of pleasure superimposed upon the other and more intoxicating still. For these tunes, each as individual as a woman, were not keeping, as she would have kept, for some privileged person, the voluptuous secret which they contained: they offered me their secrets, ogled me, came up to me with affected or vulgar movements, accosted me, caressed me as if I had suddenly become more seductive, more powerful and more rich; I indeed found in these tunes an element of cruelty; because any such thing as a disinterested feeling for beauty, a gleam of intelligence was unknown to them; for them physical pleasures alone existed. And they are the most merciless of hells, the most gateless and imprisoning for the jealous wretch to whom they present that pleasure — that pleasure which the woman he loves is enjoying with another — as the only thing that exists in the world for her who is all the world to him. But while I was humming softly to myself the notes of this tune, and returning its kiss, the pleasure peculiar to itself which it made me feel became so dear to me that I would have left my father and mother, to follow it through the singular world which it constructed in the invisible, in lines instinct with alternate languor and vivacity. Although such a pleasure as this is not calculated to enhance the value of the person to whom it comes, for it is perceived by him alone, and although whenever, in the course of our life, we have failed to attract a woman who has caught sight of us, she could not tell whether at that moment we possessed this inward and subjective felicity which, consequently, could in no way have altered the judgment that she passed on us, I felt myself more powerful, almost irresistible. It seemed to me that my love was no longer something unattractive, at which people might smile, but had precisely the touching beauty, the seductiveness of this music, itself comparable to a friendly atmosphere in which she whom I loved and I were to meet, suddenly grown intimate<br>
<br>
   This restaurant was the resort not only of light women; it was frequented also by people in the very best society, who came there for afternoon tea or gave big dinner-parties. The tea-parties were held in a long gallery, glazed and narrow, shaped like a funnel, which led from the entrance hall to the dining-room and was bounded on one side by the garden, from which it was separated (save for a few stone pillars) only by its wall of glass, in which panes would be opened here and there. The result of which, apart from ubiquitous draughts, was sudden and intermittent bursts of sunshine, a dazzling light that made it almost impossible to see the tea-drinkers, so that when they were installed there, at tables crowded pair after pair the whole way along the narrow gully, as they were shot with colours at every movement they made in drinking their tea or in greeting one another, you would have called it a reservoir, a stewpond in which the fisherman has collected all his glittering catch, and the fish, half out of water and bathed in sunlight, dazzle the eye as they mirror an ever-changing iridescence<br>
<br>
   A few hours later, during dinner, which, naturally, was served in the dining-room, the lights would be turned on, although it was still quite light out of doors, so that one saw before one’s eyes, in the garden, among summer-houses glimmering in the twilight, like pale spectres of evening, alleys whose greyish verdure was pierced by the last rays of the setting sun and, from the lamp-lit room in which we were dining, appeared through the glass — no longer, as one would have said of the ladies who had been drinking tea there in the afternoon, along the blue and gold corridor, caught in a glittering and dripping net — but like the vegetation of a pale and green aquarium of gigantic size seen by a supernatural light. People began to rise from table; and if each party while their dinner lasted, albeit they spent the whole time examining, recognising, naming the party at the next table, had been held in perfect cohesion about their own, the attractive force that had kept them gravitating round their host of the evening lost its power at the moment when, for coffee, they repaired to the same corridor that had been used for the tea-parties; it often happened that in its passage from place to place some party on the march dropped one or more of its human corpuscles who, having come under the irresistible attraction of the rival party, detached themselves for a moment from their own, in which their places were taken by ladies or gentlemen who had come across to speak to friends before hurrying off with an “I really must fly: I’m dining with M. So-and-So.” And for the moment you would have been reminded, looking at them, of two separate nosegays that had exchanged a few of their flowers. Then the corridor too began to empty. Often, since even after dinner there was still a little light left outside, they left this long corridor unlighted, and, skirted by the trees that overhung it on the other side of the glass, it suggested a pleached alley in a wooded and shady garden. Here and there, in the gloom, a fair diner lingered. As I passed through this corridor one evening on my way out I saw, sitting among a group of strangers, the beautiful Princesse de Luxembourg. I raised my hat without stopping. She remembered me, and bowed her head with a smile; in the air, far above her bowed head, but emanating from the movement, rose melodiously a few words addressed to myself, which must have been a somewhat amplified good-evening, intended not to stop me but simply to complete the gesture, to make it a spoken greeting. But her words remained so indistinct and the sound which was all that I caught was prolonged so sweetly and seemed to me so musical that it seemed as if among the dim branches of the trees a nightingale had begun to sing. If it so happened that, to finish the evening with a party of his friends whom we had met, Saint-Loup decided to go on to the Casino of a neighbouring village, and, taking them with him, put me in a carriage by myself, I would urge the driver to go as fast as he possibly could, so that the minutes might pass less slowly which I must spend without having anyone at hand to dispense me from the obligation myself to provide my sensibility — reversing the engine, so to speak, and emerging from the passivity in which I was caught and held as in the teeth of a machine — with those modifications which, since my arrival at Rivebelle, I had been receiving from other people. The risk of collision with a carriage coming the other way along those lanes where there was barely room for one and it was dark as pitch, the insecurity of the soil, crumbling in many places, at the cliff’s edge, the proximity of its vertical drop to the sea, none of these things exerted on me the slight stimulus that would have been required to bring the vision and the fear of danger within the scope of my reasoning. For just as it is not the desire to become famous but the habit of being laborious that enables us to produce a finished work, so it is not the activity of the present moment but wise reflexions from the past that help us to safeguard the future. But if already, before this point, on my arrival at Rivebelle, I had flung irretrievably away from me those crutches of reason and self-control which help our infirmity to follow the right road, if I now found myself the victim of a sort of moral ataxy, the alcohol that I had drunk, by unduly straining my nerves, gave to the minutes as they came a quality, a charm which did not have the result of leaving me more ready, or indeed more resolute to inhibit them, prevent their coming; for while it made me prefer them a thousand times to anything else in my life, my exaltation made me isolate them from everything else; I was confined to the present, as heroes are or drunkards; eclipsed for the moment, my past no longer projected before me that shadow of itself which we call our future; placing the goal of my life no longer in the realisation of the dreams of that past, but in the felicity of the present moment, I could see nothing now of what lay beyond it. So that, by a contradiction which, however, was only apparent, it was at the very moment in which I was tasting an unfamiliar pleasure, feeling that my life might yet be happy, in which it should have become more precious in my sight; it was at this very moment that, delivered from the anxieties which my life had hitherto contrived to suggest to me, I unhesitatingly abandoned it to the chance of an accident. After all, I was doing no more than concentrate in a single evening the carelessness that, for most men, is diluted throughout their whole existence, in which every day they face, unnecessarily, the dangers of a sea-voyage, of a trip in an aeroplane or motor-car, when there is waiting for them at home the creature whose life their death would shatter, or when there is still stored in the fragile receptacle of their brain that book the approaching publication of which is their one object, now, in life. And so too in the Rivebelle restaurant, on evenings when we just stayed there after dinner, if anyone had come in with the intention of killing me, as I no longer saw, save in a distant prospect too remote to have any reality, my grandmother, my life to come, the books that I was going to write, as I clung now, body and mind, wholly to the scent of the lady at the next table, the politeness of the waiters, the outline of the waltz that the band was playing, as I was glued to my immediate sensation, with no extension beyond its limits, nor any object other than not to be separated from it, I should have died in and with that sensation, I should have let myself be strangled without offering any resistance, without a movement, a bee drugged with tobacco smoke that had ceased to take any thought for preserving the accumulation of its labours and the hopes of its hive<br>
<br>
   I ought here to add that this insignificance into which the most serious matters subsided, by contrast with the violence of my exaltation, came in the end to include Mlle. Simonet and her friends. The enterprise of knowing them seemed to me easy now but hardly worth the trouble, for my immediate sensation alone, thanks to its extraordinary intensity, to the joy that its slightest modifications, its mere continuity provoked, had any importance for me; all the rest — parents, work, pleasures, girls at Balbec weighed with me no more than does a flake of foam in a strong wind that will not let it find a resting place, existed no longer save in relation to this internal power: intoxication makes real for an hour or two a subjective idealism, pure phenomenism; nothing is left now but appearances, nothing exists save as a function of our sublime self. This is not to say that a genuine love, if we have one, cannot survive in such conditions. But we feel so unmistakably, as though in a new atmosphere, that unknown pressures have altered the dimensions of that sentiment that we can no longer consider it in the old way. It is indeed still there and we shall find it, but in a different place, no longer weighing upon us, satisfied by the sensation which the present affords it, a sensation that is sufficient for us, since for what is not actually present we take no thought. Unfortunately the coefficient which thus alters our values alters them only in the hour of intoxication. The people who had lost all their importance, whom we scattered with our breath like soap-bubbles, will to-morrow resume their density; we shall have to try afresh to settle down to work which this evening had ceased to have any significance. A more serious matter still, these mathematics of the morrow, the same as those of yesterday, in whose problems we shall find ourselves inexorably involved, it is they that govern us even in these hours, and we alone are unconscious of their rule. If there should happen to be, near us, a woman, virtuous or inimical, that question so difficult an hour ago — to know whether we should succeed in finding favour with her — seems to us now a million times easier of solution without having become easier in any respect, for it is only in our own sight, in our own inward sight, that we have altered. And she is as much annoyed with us at this moment as we shall be next day at the thought of our having given a hundred francs to the messenger, and for the same reason which in our case has merely been delayed in its operation, namely the absence of intoxication<br>
<br>
   I knew none of the women who were at Rivebelle and, because they formed a part of my intoxication just as its reflexions form part of a mirror, appeared to me now a thousand times more to be desired than the less and less existent Mlle. Simonet. One of them, young, fair, by herself, with a sad expression on a face framed in a straw hat trimmed with field-flowers, gazed at me for a moment with a dreamy air and struck me as being attractive. Then it was the turn of another, and of a third; finally of a dark one with glowing cheeks. Almost all of them were known, if not to myself, to Saint-Loup<br>
<br>
   He had, in fact, before he made the acquaintance of his present mistress, lived so much in the restricted world of amorous adventure that all the women who would be dining on these evenings at Rivebelle, where many of them had appeared quite by chance, having come to the coast some to join their lovers, others in the hope of finding fresh lovers there, there was scarcely one that he did not know from having spent — or if not he, one or other of his friends — at least one night in their company. He did not bow to them if they were with men, and they, albeit they looked more at him than at anyone else, for the indifference which he was known to feel towards every woman who was not his mistress gave him in their eyes an exceptional interest, appeared not to know him. But you could hear them whispering: “That’s young Saint-Loup. It seems he’s still quite gone on that girl of his. Got it bad, he has. What a dear boy! I think he’s just wonderful; and what style! Some girls do have all the luck, don’t they? And he’s so nice in every way. I saw a lot of him when I was with d’Orléans. They were quite inseparable, those two. He was going the pace, that time. But he’s given it all up now, she can’t complain. She’s had a good run of luck, that she can say. And I ask you, what in the world can he see in her? He must be a bit of a chump, when all’s said and done. She’s got feet like boats, whiskers like an American, and her undies are filthy. I can tell you, a little shop girl would be ashamed to be seen in her knickers. Do just look at his eyes a moment; you would jump into the fire for a man like that. Hush, don’t say a word; he’s seen me; look, he’s smiling. Oh, he remembers me all right. Just you mention my name to him, and see what he says!” Between these girls and him I surprised a glance of mutual understanding. I should have liked him to introduce me to them, so that I might ask them for assignations and they give them to me, even if I had been unable to keep them. For otherwise their appearance would remain for all time devoid, in my memory, of that part of itself — just as though it had been hidden by a veil — which varies in every woman, which we cannot imagine in any woman until we have actually seen it in her, and which is apparent only in the glance that she directs at us, that acquiesces in our desire and promises that it shall be satisfied. And yet, even when thus reduced, their aspect was for me far more than that of women whom I should have known to be virtuous, and it seemed to me not to be, like theirs, flat, with nothing behind it, fashioned in one piece with no solidity. It was not, of course, for me what it must be for Saint-Loup who, by an act of memory, beneath the indifference, transparent to him, of the motionless features which affected not to know him, or beneath the dull formality of the greeting that might equally well have been addressed to anyone else, could recall, could see, through dishevelled locks, a swooning mouth, a pair of half-closed eyes, a whole silent picture like those that painters, to cheat their visitors’ senses, drape with a decent covering. Undoubtedly, for me who felt that nothing of my personality had penetrated the surface of this woman or that, or would be borne by her upon the unknown ways which she would tread through life, those faces remained sealed. But it was quite enough to know that they did open, for them to seem to me of a price which I should not have set on them had they been but precious medals, instead of lockets within which were hidden memories of love. As for Robert, scarcely able to keep in his place at table, concealing beneath a courtier’s smile his warrior’s thirst for action — when I examined him I could see how closely the vigorous structure of his triangular face must have been modelled on that of his ancestors’ faces, a face devised rather for an ardent bowman than for a delicate student. Beneath his fine skin the bold construction, the feudal architecture were apparent. His head made one think of those old dungeon keeps on which the disused battlements are still to be seen, although inside they have been converted into libraries<br>
<br>
   On our way back to Balbec, of those of the fair strangers to whom he had introduced me I would repeat to myself without a moment’s interruption, and yet almost unconsciously: “What a delightful woman!” as one chimes in with the refrain of a song. I admit that these words were prompted rather by the state of my nerves than by any lasting judgment. It was nevertheless true that if I had had a thousand francs on me and if there had still been a jeweller’s shop open at that hour, I should have bought the lady a ring. When the successive hours of our life are thus displayed against too widely dissimilar backgrounds, we find that we give away too much of ourselves to all sorts of people who next day will not interest us in the least. But we feel that we are still responsible for what we said to them overnight, and that we must honour our promises<br>
<br>
   As on these evenings I came back later than usual to the hotel, it was with joy that I recognised, in a room no longer hostile, the bed on which, on the day of my arrival, I had supposed that it would always be impossible for me to find any rest, whereas now my weary limbs turned to it for support; so that, in turn, thighs, hips, shoulders burrowed into, trying to adhere at every angle to, the sheets that covered its mattress, as if my fatigue, like a sculptor, had wished to take a cast of an entire human body. But I could not go to sleep; I felt the approach of morning; peace of mind, health of body, were no longer mine. In my distress it seemed that never should I recapture them. I should have had to sleep for a long time if I were to overtake them. But then, had I begun to doze, I must in any event be awakened in a couple of hours by the symphonic concert on the beach. Suddenly I was asleep, I had fallen into that deep slumber in which are opened to us a return to childhood, the recapture of past years, of lost feelings, the disincarnation, the transmigration of the soul, the evoking of the dead, the illusions of madness, retrogression towards the most elementary of the natural kingdoms (for we say that we often see animals in our dreams, but we forget almost always that we are ourself then an animal deprived of that reasoning power which projects upon things the light of certainty; we present on the contrary to the spectacle of life only a dubious vision, destroyed afresh every moment by oblivion, the former reality fading before that which follows it as one projection of a magic lantern fades before the next as we change the slide), all those mysteries which we imagine ourselves not to know and into which we are in reality initiated almost every night, as we are into the other great mystery of annihilation and resurrection. Rendered more vagabond by the difficulty of digesting my Rivebelle dinner, the successive and flickering illumination of shadowy zones of my past made of me a being whose supreme happiness would have been that of meeting Legrandin, with whom I had just been talking in my dream<br>
<br>
   And then, even my own life was entirely hidden from me by a new setting, like the ‘drop’ lowered right at the front of the stage before which, while the scene snifters are busy behind, actors appear in a fresh ‘turn.’ The turn in which I was now cast for a part was in the manner of an Oriental fairy-tale; I retained no knowledge of my past or of myself, on account of the intense proximity of this interpolated scenery; I was merely a person who received the bastinado and underwent various punishments for a crime the nature of which I could not distinguish, though it was actually that of having taken too much port wine. Suddenly I awoke and discovered that, thanks to a long sleep, I had not heard a note of the concert. It was already afternoon; I verified this by my watch after several efforts to sit up in bed, efforts fruitless at first and interrupted by backward falls on to my pillow, but those short falls which are a sequel of sleep as of other forms of intoxication, whether due to wine or to convalescence; besides, before I had so much as looked at the time, I was certain that it was past midday. Last night I had been nothing more than an empty vessel, without weight, and (since I must first have gone to bed to be able to keep still, and have been asleep to be able to keep silent) had been unable to refrain from moving about and talking; I had no longer any stability, any centre of gravity, I was set in motion and it seemed that I might have continued on my dreary course until I reached the moon. But if, while I slept, my eyes had not seen the time, my body had nevertheless contrived to calculate it, had measured the hours; not on a dial superficially marked and figured, but by the steadily growing weight of all my replenished forces which, like, a powerful clockwork, it had allowed, notch by notch, to descend from my brain into the rest of my body in which there had risen now to above my knees the unbroken abundance of their store. If it is true that the sea was once upon a time our native element, into which we must plunge our cooling blood if we are to recover our strength, it is the same with the oblivion, the mental non-existence of sleep; we seem then to absent ourselves for a few hours from Time, but the forces which we have gathered in that interval without expending them, measure it by their quantity as accurately as the pendulum of the clock or the crumbling pyramid of the sandglass. Nor does one emerge more easily from such sleep than from a prolonged spell of wakefulness, so strongly does everything tend to persist; and if it is true that certain narcotics make us sleep, to have slept for any time is an even stronger narcotic, after which we have great difficulty in making ourselves wake up. Like a sailor who sees plainly the harbour in which he can moor his vessel, still tossed by the waves, I had a quite definite idea of looking at the time and of getting up, but my body was at every moment cast back upon the tide of sleep; the landing was difficult, and before I attained a position in which I could reach my watch and confront with its time that indicated by the wealth of accumulated material which my stiffened limbs had at their disposal, I fell back two or three times more upon my pillow<br>
<br>
   At length I could reach and read it: “Two o’clock in the afternoon!” I rang; but at once I returned to a slumber which, this time, must have lasted infinitely longer, if I was to judge by the refreshment, the vision of an immense night overpassed, which I found on awakening. And yet as my awakening was caused by the entry of Françoise, and as her entry had been prompted by my ringing the bell, this second sleep which, it seemed to me, must have been longer than the other, and had brought me so much comfort and forgetfulness, could not have lasted for more than half a minute<br>
<br>
   My grandmother opened the door of my bedroom; I asked her various questions about the Legrandin family<br>
<br>
   It is not enough to say that I had returned to tranquillity and health, for it was more than a mere interval of space that had divided them from me yesterday, I had had all night long to struggle against a contrary tide, and now I not only found myself again in their presence, they had once more entered into me. At certain definite and still somewhat painful points beneath the surface of my empty head which would one day be broken, letting my ideas escape for all time, those ideas had once again taken their proper places and resumed that existence by which hitherto, alas, they had failed to profit<br>
<br>
   Once again I had escaped from the impossibility of sleeping, from the deluge, the shipwreck of my nervous storms. I feared now not at all the menaces that had loomed over me the evening before, when I was dismantled of repose. A new life was opening before me; without making a single movement, for I was still shattered, although quite alert and well, I savoured my weariness with a light heart; it had isolated and broken asunder the bones of my legs and arms, which I could feel assembled before me, ready to cleave together, and which I was to raise to life merely by singing, like the builder in the fable<br>
<br>
   Suddenly I thought of the fair girl with the sad expression whom I had seen at Rivebelle, where she had looked at me for a moment. Many others, in the course of the evening, had seemed to me attractive; now she alone arose from the dark places of my memory. I had felt that she noticed me, had expected one of the waiters to come to me with a whispered message from her. Saint-Loup did not know her and fancied that she was respectable. It would be very difficult to see her, to see her constantly. But I was prepared to make any sacrifice, I thought now only of her. Philosophy distinguishes often between free and necessary acts. Perhaps there is none to the necessity of which we are more completely subjected than that which, by virtue of an ascending power held in check during the act itself, makes so unfailingly (once our mind is at rest) spring up a memory that was levelled with other memories by the distributed pressure of our indiffer-ance, and rush to the surface, because unknown to us it contained, more than any of the others, a charm of which we do not become aware until the following day. And perhaps there is not, either, any act so free, for it is still unprompted by habit, by that sort of mental hallucination which, when we are in love, facilitates the invariable reappearance of the image of one particular person<br>
<br>
   This was the day immediately following that on which I had seen file past me against a background of sea the beautiful procession of young girls. I put questions about them to a number of the visitors in the hotel, people who came almost every year to Balbec. They could tell me nothing. Later on, a photograph shewed me why. Who could ever recognise now in them, scarcely and yet quite definitely beyond an age in which one changes so utterly, that amorphous, delicious mass, still wholly infantine, of little girls who, only a few years back, might have been seen sitting in a ring on the sand round a tent; a sort of white and vague constellation in which one would have distinguished a pair of eyes that sparkled more than the rest, a mischievous face, flaxen hair, only to lose them again and to confound them almost at once in the indistinct and milky nebula<br>
<br>
   No doubt, in those earlier years that were still so recent, it was not, as it had been yesterday when they appeared for the first time before me, one’s impression of the group, but the group itself that had been lacking in clearness. Then those children, mere babies, had been still at that elementary stage in their formation when personality has not set its seal on every face. Like those primitive organisms in which the individual barely exists by itself, consists in the reef rather than in the coral insects that compose it, they were still pressed one against another. Sometimes one pushed her neighbour over, and then a wild laugh, which seemed the sole manifestation of their personal life, convulsed them all at once, obliterating, confounding those indefinite, grinning faces in the congealment of a single cluster, scintillating and tremulous. In an old photograph of themselves, which they were one day to give me, and which I have kept ever since, their infantile troop already presents the same number of participants as, later, their feminine procession; one can see from it that their presence must, even then, have made on the beach an unusual mark which forced itself on the attention; but one cannot recognise them individually in it save by a process of reasoning, leaving a clear field to all the transformations possible during girlhood, up to the point at which one reconstructed form would begin to encroach upon another individuality, which must be identified also, and whose handsome face, owing to the accessories of a large build and curly hair, may quite possibly have been, once, that wizened and impish little grin which the photograph album presents to us; and the distance traversed in a short interval of time by the physical characteristics of each of these girls making of them a criterion too vague to be of any use, whereas what they had in common and, so to speak, collectively, had at that early date been strongly marked, it sometimes happened that even their most intimate friends mistook one for another in this photograph, so much so that the question could in the last resort be settled only by some detail of costume which one of them could be certain that she herself, and not any of the others, had worn. Since those days, so different from the day on which I had just seen them strolling along the ‘front,’ so different and yet so close in time, they still gave way to fits of laughter, as I had observed that afternoon, but to laughter of a kind that was no longer the intermittent and almost automatic laughter of childhood, a spasmodic discharge which, in those days, had continually sent their heads dipping out of the circle, as the clusters of minnows in the Vivonne used to scatter and vanish only to gather again a moment later; each countenance was now mistress of itself, their eyes were fixed on the goal towards which they were marching; and it had taken, yesterday, the indecision and tremulousness of my first impression to make me confuse vaguely (as their childish hilarity and the old photograph had confused) the spores now individualised and disjoined of the pale madrepore<br>
<br>
   Repeatedly, I dare say, when pretty girls went by, I had promised myself that I would see them again. As a rule, people do not appear a second time; moreover our memory, which speedily forgets their existence, would find it difficult to recall their appearance; our eyes would not recognise them, perhaps, and in the meantime we have seen new girls go by, whom we shall not see again either. But at other times, and this was what was to happen with the pert little band at Balbec, chance brings them back insistently before our eyes. Chance seems to us then a good and useful thing, for we discern in it as it were rudiments of organisation, of an attempt to arrange our life; and it makes easy to us, inevitable, and sometimes — after interruptions that have made us hope that we may cease to remember — cruel, the retention in our minds of images to the possession of which we shall come in time to believe that we were predestined, and which but for chance we should from the very first have managed to forget, like so many others, with so little difficulty<br>
<br>
   Presently Saint-Loup’s visit drew to an end. I had not seen that party of girls again on the beach. He was too little at Balbec in the afternoons to have time to bother about them, or to attempt, in my interest, to make their acquaintance. In the evenings he was more free, and continued to take me constantly to Rivebelle. There are, in those restaurants, as there are in public gardens and railway trains, people embodied in a quite ordinary appearance, whose name astonishes us when, having happened to ask it, we discover that this is not the mere inoffensive stranger whom we supposed but nothing less than the Minister or Duke of whom we have so often heard. Two or three times already, in the Rivebelle restaurant, we had — Saint-Loup and I— seen come in and sit down at a table when everyone else was getting ready to go, a man of large stature, very muscular, with regular features and a grizzled beard, gazing, with concentrated attention, into the empty air. One evening, on our asking the landlord who was this obscure, solitary and belated diner, “What!” he exclaimed, “do you mean to say you don’t know the famous painter Elstir?” Swann had once mentioned his name to me, I had entirely forgotten in what connexion; but the omission of a particular memory, like that of part of a sentence when we are reading, leads sometimes not to uncertainty but to a birth of certainty that is premature. “He is a friend of Swann, a very well known artist, extremely good,” I told Saint-Loup. Whereupon there passed over us both, like a wave of emotion, the thought that Elstir was a great artist, a celebrated man, and that, confounding us with the rest of the diners, he had no suspicion of the ecstasy into which we were thrown by the idea of his talent. Doubtless, his unconsciousness of our admiration and of our acquaintance with Swann would not have troubled us had we not been at the seaside. But since we were still at an age when enthusiasm cannot keep silence, and had been transported into a life in which not to be known is unendurable, we wrote a letter, signed with both our names, in which we revealed to Elstir in the two diners seated within a few feet of him two passionate admirers of his talent, two friends of his great friend Swann, and asked to be allowed to pay our homage to him in person. A waiter undertook to convey this missive to the celebrity<br>
<br>
   A celebrity Elstir was, perhaps, not yet at this period quite to the extent claimed by the landlord, though he was to reach the height of his fame within a very few years. But he had been one of the first to frequent this restaurant when it was still only a sort of farmhouse, and had brought to it a whole colony of artists (who had all, as it happened, migrated elsewhere as soon as the farm-yard in which they used to feed in the open air, under a lean-to roof, had become a fashionable centre); Elstir himself had returned to Rivebelle this evening only on account of a temporary absence of his wife, from the house which he had taken in the neighbourhood. But great talent, even when its existence is not yet recognised, will inevitably provoke certain phenomena of admiration, such as the landlord had managed to detect in the questions asked by more than one English lady visitor, athirst for information as to the life led by Elstir, or in the number of letters that he received from abroad. Then the landlord had further remarked that Elstir did not like to be disturbed when he was working, that he would rise in the middle of the night and take a little model down to the water’s edge to pose for him, nude, if the moon was shining; and had told himself that so much labour was not in vain, nor the admiration of the tourists unjustified when he had, in one of Elstir’s pictures, recognised a wooden cross which stood by the roadside as you came into Rivebelle<br>
<br>
    “It’s all right!” he would repeat with stupefaction, “there are all the four beams! Oh, he does take a lot of trouble!”<br>
<br>
   And he did not know whether a little Sunrise Over the Sea which Elstir had given him might not be worth a fortune<br>
<br>
   We watched him read our letter, put it in his pocket, finish his dinner, begin to ask for his things, get up to go; and we were so convinced that we had shocked him by our overture that we would now have hoped (as keenly as at first we had dreaded) to make our escape without his noticing us. We did not bear in mind for a single instant a consideration which should, nevertheless, have seemed to us most important, namely that our enthusiasm for Elstir, on the sincerity of which we should not have allowed the least doubt to be cast, which we could indeed have supported with the evidence of our breathing arrested by expectancy, our desire to do no matter what that was difficult or heroic for the great man, was not, as we imagined it to be, admiration, since neither of us had ever seen anything that he had painted; our feeling might have as its object the hollow idea of a ‘great artist,’ but not a body of work which was unknown to us. It was, at the most, admiration in the abstract, the nervous envelope, the sentimental structure of an admiration without content, that is to say a thing as indissolubly attached to boyhood as are certain organs which have ceased to exist in the adult man; we were still boys. Elstir meanwhile was reaching the door when suddenly he turned and came towards us. I was transported by a delicious thrill of terror such as I could not have felt a few years later, because, while age diminishes our capacity, familiarity with the world has meanwhile destroyed in us any inclination to provoke such strange encounters, to feel that kind of emotion<br>
<br>
   In the course of the few words that Elstir had come back to say to us, sitting down at our table, he never gave any answer on the several occasions on which I spoke to him of Swann. I began to think that he did not know him. He asked me, nevertheless, to come and see him at his Balbec studio, an invitation which he did not extend to Saint-Loup, and which I had earned (as I might not, perhaps, from Swann’s recommendation, had Elstir been intimate with him, for the part played by disinterested motives is greater than we are inclined to think in people’s lives) by a few words which made him think that I was devoted to the arts. He lavished on me a friendliness which was as far above that of Saint-Loup as that was above the affability of a mere tradesman. Compared with that of a great artist, the friendliness of a great gentleman, charming as it may be, has the effect of an actor’s playing a part, of being feigned. Saint-Loup sought to please; Elstir loved to give, to give himself. Everything that he possessed, ideas, work, and the rest which he counted for far less, he would have given gladly to anyone who could understand him. But, failing society that was endurable, he lived in an isolation, with a savagery which fashionable people called pose and ill-breeding, public authorities a recalcitrant spirit, his neighbours madness, his family selfishness and pride<br>
<br>
   And no doubt at first he had thought, even in his solitude, with enjoyment that, thanks to his work, he was addressing, in spite of distance, he was giving a loftier idea of himself, to those who had misunderstood or hurt him. Perhaps, in those days, he lived alone not from indifference but from love of his fellows, and, just as I had renounced Gilberte to appear to her again one day in more attractive colours, dedicated his work to certain people as a way of approaching them again, by which without actually seeing him they would be made to love him, admire him, talk about him; a renunciation is not always complete from the start, when we decide upon it in our original frame of mind and before it has reacted upon us, whether it be the renunciation of an invalid, a monk, an artist or a hero. But if he had wished to produce with certain people in his mind, in producing he had lived for himself, remote from the society to which he had become indifferent; the practice of solitude had given him a love for it, as happens with every big thing which we have begun by fearing, because we knew it to be incompatible with smaller things to which we clung, and of which it does not so much deprive us as it detaches us from them. Before we experience it, our whole preoccupation is to know to what extent we can reconcile it with certain pleasures which cease to be pleasures as soon as we have experienced it<br>
<br>
   Elstir did not stay long talking to us. I made up my mind that I would go to his studio during the next few days, but on the following afternoon, when I had accompanied my grandmother right to the point at which the ‘front’ ended, near the cliffs of Canapville, on our way back, at the foot of one of the little streets which ran down at right angles to the beach, we came upon a girl who, with lowered head like an animal that is being driven reluctant to its stall, and carrying golf-clubs, was walking in front of a person in authority, in all probability her or her friends’ ‘Miss,’ who suggested a portrait of Jeffreys by Hogarth, with a face as red as if her favourite beverage were gin rather than tea, on which a dried smear of tobacco at the corner of her mouth prolonged the curve of a moustache that was grizzled but abundant. The girl who preceded her was like that one of the little band who, beneath a black polo-cap, had shewn in an inexpressive chubby face a pair of laughing eyes. Now, the girl who was now passing me had also a black polo-cap, but she struck me as being even prettier than the other, the line of her nose was straighter, the curve of nostril at its base fuller and more fleshy. Besides, the other had seemed a proud, pale girl, this one a child well-disciplined and of rosy complexion. And yet, as she was pushing a bicycle just like the other’s, and was wearing the same reindeer gloves, I concluded that the differences arose perhaps from the angle and circumstances in which I now saw her, for it was hardly likely that there could be at Balbec a second girl, with a face that, when all was said, was so similar and with the same details in her accoutrements. She cast a rapid glance in my direction; for the next few days, when I saw the little band again on the beach, and indeed long afterwards when I knew all the girls who composed it, I could never be absolutely certain that any of them — even she who among them all was most like her, the girl with the bicycle — was indeed the one that I had seen that evening at the end of the ‘front,’ where a street ran down to the beach, a girl who differed hardly at all, but was still just perceptibly different from her whom I had noticed in the procession<br>
<br>
   From that moment, whereas for the last few days my mind had been occupied chiefly by the tall one, it was the one with the golf-clubs, presumed to be Mlle. Simonet, who began once more to absorb my attention. When walking with the others she would often stop, forcing her friends, who seemed greatly to respect her, to stop also. Thus it is, calling a halt, her eyes sparkling beneath her polo-cap, that I see her again to-day, outlined against the screen which the sea spreads out behind her, and separated from me by a transparent, azure space, the interval of time that has elapsed since then, a first impression, faint and fine in my memory, desired, pursued, then forgotten, then found again, of a face which I have many times since projected upon the cloud of the past to be able to say to myself, of a girl who was actually in my room: “It is she!” But it was perhaps yet another, the one with geranium cheeks and green eyes, whom I should have liked most to know. And yet, whichever of them it might be, on any given day, that I preferred to see, the others, without her, were sufficient to excite my desire which, concentrated now chiefly on one, now on another, continued — as, on the first day, my confused vision — to combine and blend them, to make of them the little world apart, animated by a life in common, which for that matter they doubtless imagined themselves to form; and I should have penetrated, in becoming a friend of one of them — like a cultivated pagan or a meticulous Christian going among barbarians — into a rejuvenating society in which reigned health, unconsciousness of others, sensual pleasures, cruelty, unintellectuality and joy<br>
<br>
   My grandmother, who had been told of my meeting with Elstir, and rejoiced at the thought of all the intellectual profit that I might derive from his friendship, considered it absurd and none too polite of me not to have gone yet to pay him a visit. But I could think only of the little band, and being uncertain of the hour at which the girls would be passing along the front, I dared not absent myself. My grandmother was astonished, too, at the smartness of my attire, for I had suddenly remembered suits which had been lying all this time at the bottom of my trunk. I put on a different one every day, and had even written to Paris ordering new hats and neckties<br>
<br>
   It adds a great charm to life in a watering-place like Balbec if the face of a pretty girl, a vendor of shells, cakes or flowers, painted in vivid colours in our mind, is regularly, from early morning, the purpose of each of those leisured, luminous days which we spend upon the beach. They become then, and for that reason, albeit unoccupied by any business, as alert as working-days, pointed, magnetised, raised slightly to meet an approaching moment, that in which, while we purchase sand-cakes, roses, ammonites, we will delight in seeing upon a feminine face its colours displayed as purely as on a flower. But at least, with these little traffickers, first of all we can speak to them, which saves us from having to construct with our imagination their aspects other than those with which the mere visual perception of them furnishes us, and to recreate their life, magnifying its charm, as when we stand before a portrait; moreover, just because we speak to them, we can learn where and at what time it will be possible to see them again. Now I had none of these advantages with respect to the little band. Their habits were unknown to me; when on certain days I failed to catch a glimpse of them, not knowing the cause of their absence I sought to discover whether it was something fixed and regular, if they were to be seen only every other day, or in certain states of the weather, or if there were days on which no one ever saw them. I imagined myself already friends with them, and saying: “But you weren’t there the other day?” “Weren’t we? Oh, no, of course not; that was because it was a Saturday. On Saturdays we don’t ever come, because . . . ” If it were only as simple as that, to know that on black Saturday it was useless to torment oneself, that one might range the beach from end to end, sit down outside the pastry-cook’s and pretend to be nibbling an éclair, poke into the curiosity shop, wait for bathing time, the concert, high tide, sunset, night, all without seeing the longed-for little band. But the fatal day did not, perhaps, come once a week. It did not, perhaps, of necessity fall on Saturdays. Perhaps certain atmospheric conditions influenced it or were entirely unconnected with it. How many observations, patient but not at all serene, must one accumulate of the movements, to all appearance irregular, of those unknown worlds before being able to be sure that one has not allowed oneself to be led astray by mere coincidence, that one’s forecasts will not be proved wrong, before one elucidates the certain laws, acquired at the cost of so much painful experience, of that passionate astronomy. Remembering that I had not yet seen them on some particular day of the week, I assured myself that they would not be coming, that it was useless to wait any longer on the beach. And at that very moment I caught sight of them. And yet on another day which, so far as I could suppose that there were laws that guided the return of those constellations, must, I had calculated, prove an auspicious day, they did not come. But to this primary uncertainty whether I should see them or not that day, there was added another, more disquieting: whether I should ever set eyes on them again, for I had no reason, after all, to know that they were not about to sail for America, or to return to Paris. This was enough to make me begin to love them. One can feel an attraction towards a particular person. But to release that fount of sorrow, that sense of the irreparable, those agonies which prepare the way for love, there must be — and this is, perhaps, more than any person can be, the actual object which our passion seeks so anxiously to embrace — the risk of an impossibility. Thus there were acting upon me already those influences which recur in the course of our successive love-affairs, which can, for that matter, be provoked (but then rather in the life of cities) by the thought of little working girls whose half-holiday is we know not on what day, and whom we are afraid of having missed as they came out of the factory; or which at least have recurred in mine. Perhaps they are inseparable from love; perhaps everything that formed a distinctive feature of our first love attaches itself to those that come after, by recollection, suggestion, habit, and through the successive periods of our life gives to its different aspects a general character<br>
<br>
   I seized every pretext for going down to the beach at the hours when I hoped to succeed in finding them there. Having caught sight of them once while we were at luncheon, I now invariably came in late for it, waiting interminably upon the ‘front’ for them to pass; devoting all the short time that I did spend in the dining-room to interrogating with my eyes its azure wall of glass; rising long before the dessert, so as not to miss them should they have gone out at a different hour, and chafing with irritation at my grandmother, when, with unwitting malevolence, she made me stay with her past the hour that seemed to me propitious. I tried to prolong the horizon by setting my chair aslant; if, by chance, I did catch sight of no matter which of the girls, since they all partook of the same special essence, it was as if I had seen projected before my face in a shifting, diabolical hallucination, a little of the unfriendly and yet passionately coveted dream which, but a moment ago, had existed only — where it lay stagnant for all time — in my brain<br>
<br>
   I was in love with none of them, loving them all, and yet the possibility of meeting them was in my daily life the sole element of delight, alone made to burgeon in me those high hopes by which every obstacle is surmounted, hopes ending often in fury if I had not seen them. For the moment, these girls eclipsed my grandmother in my affection; the longest journey would at once have seemed attractive to me had it been to a place in which they might be found. It was to them that my thoughts comfortably clung when I supposed myself to be thinking of something else or of nothing. But when, even without knowing it, I thought of them, they, more unconsciously still, were for me the mountainous blue undulations of the sea, a troop seen passing in outline against the waves. Our most intensive love for a person is always the love, really, of something else as well<br>
<br>
   Meanwhile my grandmother was shewing, because now I was keenly interested in golf and lawn-tennis and was letting slip an opportunity of seeing at work and hearing talk an artist whom she knew to be one of the greatest of his time, a disapproval which seemed to me to be based on somewhat narrow views. I had guessed long ago in the Champs-Elysées, and had since established to my own satisfaction, that when we are in love with a woman we simply project into her a state of our own soul, that the important thing is, therefore, not the worth of the woman but the depth of the state; and that the emotions which a young girl of no kind of distinction arouses in us can enable us to bring to the surface of our consciousness some of the most intimate parts of our being, more personal, more remote, more essential than would be reached by the pleasure that we derive from the conversation of a great man or even from the admiring contemplation of his work<br>
<br>
   I was to end by complying with my grandmother’s wishes, all the more reluctantly in that Elstir lived at some distance from the ‘front’ in one of the newest of Balbec’s avenues. The heat of the day obliged me to take the tramway which passed along the Rue de la Plage, and I made an effort (so as still to believe that I was in the ancient realm of the Cimmerians, in the country it might be, of King Mark, or upon the site of the Forest of Broceliande) not to see the gimcrack splendour of the buildings that extended on either hand, among which Elstir’s villa was perhaps the most sumptuously hideous, in spite of which he had taken it, because, of all that there were to be had at Balbec, it was the only one that provided him with a really big studio<br>
<br>
   It was also with averted eyes that I crossed the garden, which had a lawn — in miniature, like any little suburban villa round Paris — a statuette of an amorous gardener, glass balls in which one saw one’s distorted reflexion, beds of begonias and a little arbour, beneath which rocking chairs were drawn up round an iron table. But after all these preliminaries hallmarked with philistine ugliness, I took no notice of the chocolate mouldings on the plinths once I was in the studio; I felt perfectly happy, for, with the help of all the sketches and studies that surrounded me, I foresaw the possibility of raising myself to a poetical understanding, rich in delights, of many forms which I had not, hitherto, isolated from the general spectacle of reality. And Elstir’s studio appeared to me as the laboratory of a sort of new creation of the world in which, from the chaos that is all the things we see, he had extracted, by painting them on various rectangles of canvas that were hung everywhere about the room, here a wave of the sea crushing angrily on the sand its lilac foam, there a young man in a suit of white linen, leaning upon the rail of a vessel. His jacket and the spattering wave had acquired fresh dignity from the fact that they continued to exist, even although they were deprived of those qualities in which they might be supposed to consist, the wave being no longer able to splash nor the jacket to clothe anyone<br>
<br>
   At the moment at which I entered, the creator was just finishing, with the brush which he had in his hand, the form of the sun at its setting<br>
<br>
   The shutters were closed almost everywhere round the studio, which was fairly cool and, except in one place where daylight laid against the wall its brilliant but fleeting decoration, dark; there was open only one little rectangular window embowered in honeysuckle, which, over a strip of garden, gave on an avenue; so that the atmosphere of the greater part of the studio was dusky, transparent and compact in the mass, but liquid and sparkling at the rifts where the golden clasp of sunlight banded it, like a lump of rock crystal of which one surface, already cut and polished, here and there, gleams like a mirror with iridescent rays. While Elstir, at my request, went on painting, I wandered about in the half-light, stopping to examine first one picture, then another<br>
<br>
   Most of those that covered the walls were not what I should chiefly have liked to see of his work, paintings in what an English art journal which lay about on the reading-room table in the Grand Hotel called his first and second manners, the mythological manner and the manner in which he shewed signs of Japanese influence, both admirably exemplified, the article said, in the collection of Mme. de Guermantes. Naturally enough, what he had in his studio were almost all seascapes done here, at Balbec. But I was able to discern from these that the charm of each of them lay in a sort of metamorphosis of the things represented in it, analogous to what in poetry we call metaphor, and that, if God the Father had created things by naming them, it was by taking away their names or giving them other names that Elstir created them anew. The names which denote things correspond invariably to an intellectual notion, alien to our true impressions, and compelling us to eliminate from them everything that is not in keeping with itself<br>
<br>
   Sometimes in my window in the hotel at Balbec, in the morning when Françoise undid the fastenings of the curtains that shut out the light, in the evening when I was waiting until it should be time to go out with Saint-Loup, I had been led by some effect of sunlight to mistake what was only a darker stretch of sea for a distant coastline, or to gaze at a belt of liquid azure without knowing whether it belonged to sea or sky. But presently my reason would re-establish between the elements that distinction which in my first impression I had overlooked. In the same way I used, in Paris, in my bedroom, to hear a dispute, almost a. riot, in the street below, until I had referred back to its cause — a carriage for instance that was rattling towards me — this noise, from which I now eliminated the shrill and discordant vociferations which my ear had really heard but which my reason knew that wheels did not produce. But the rare moments in which we see nature as she is, with poetic vision, it was from those that Elstir’s work was taken. One of his metaphors that occurred most commonly in the seascapes which he had round him was precisely that which, comparing land with sea, suppressed every line of demarcation between them. It was this comparison, tacitly and untiringly repeated on a single canvas, which gave it that multiform and powerful unity, the cause (not always clearly perceived by themselves) of the enthusiasm which Elstir’s work aroused in certain collectors<br>
<br>
   It was, for instance, for a metaphor of this sort — in a picture of the harbour of Carquethuit, a picture which he had finished a few days earlier and at which I now stood gazing my fill — that Elstir had prepared the mind of the spectator by employing, for the little town, only marine terms, and urban terms for the sea. Whether its houses concealed a part of the harbour, a dry dock, or perhaps the sea itself came cranking in among the land, as constantly happened on the Balbec coast, on the other side of the promontory on which the town was built the roofs were overtopped (as it had been by mill-chimneys or church-steeples) by masts which had the effect of making the vessels to which they belonged appear town-bred, built on land, an impression which was strengthened by the sight of other boats, moored along the jetty but in such serried ranks that you could see men talking across from one deck to another without being able to distinguish the dividing line, the chink of water between them, so that this fishing fleet seemed less to belong to the water than, for instance, the churches of Criquebec which, in the far distance, surrounded by water on every side because you saw them without seeing the town, in a powdery haze of sunlight and crumbling waves, seemed to be emerging from the waters, blown in alabaster or in sea-foam, and, enclosed in the band of a particoloured rainbow, to form an unreal, a mystical picture. On the beach in the foreground the painter had arranged that the eye should discover no fixed boundary, no absolute line of demarcation between earth and ocean. The men who were pushing down their boats into the sea were running as much through the waves as along the sand, which, being wet, reflected their hulls as if they were already in the water. The sea itself did not come up in an even line but followed the irregularities of the shore, which the perspective of the picture increased still further, so that a ship actually at sea, half-hidden by the projecting works of the arsenal, seemed to be sailing across the middle of the town; women who were gathering shrimps among the rocks had the appearance, because they were surrounded by water and because of the depression which, after the ringlike barrier of rocks, brought the beach (on the side nearest the land) down to sea-level, of being in a marine grotto overhung by ships and waves, open yet unharmed in the path of a miraculously averted tide. If the whole picture gave this impression of harbours in which the sea entered into the land, in which the land was already subaqueous and the population amphibian, the strength of the marine element was everywhere apparent; and round about the rocks, at the mouth of the harbour, where the sea was rough, you felt from the muscular efforts of the fishermen and the obliquity of the boats leaning over at an acute angle, compared with the calm erect-ness of the warehouse on the harbour, the church, the houses of the town to which some of the figures were returning while others were coming out to fish, that they were riding bareback on the water, as it might be a swift and fiery animal whose rearing, but for their skill, must have unseated them. A party of holiday makers were putting gaily out to sea in a boat that tossed like a jaunting-car on a rough road; their boatman, blithe but attentive, also, to what he was doing, trimmed the bellying sail, every one kept in his place, so that the weight should not be all on one side of the boat, which might capsize, and so they went racing over sunlit fields into shadowy places, dashing down into the troughs of waves. It was a fine morning in spite of the recent storm. Indeed, one could still feel the powerful activities that must first be neutralized in order to attain the easy balance of the boats that lay motionless, enjoying sunshine and breeze, in parts where the sea was so calm that its reflexions had almost more solidity and reality than the floating hulls, vaporised by an effect of the sunlight, parts which the perspective of the picture dovetailed in among others. Or rather you would not have called them other parts of the sea. For between those parts there was as much difference as there was between one of them and the church rising from the water, or the ships behind the town. Your reason then set to work and made a single element of what was here black beneath a gathering storm, a little farther all of one colour with the sky and as brightly burnished, and elsewhere so bleached by sunshine, haze and foam, so compact, so terrestrial, so circumscribed with houses that you thought of some white stone causeway or of a field of snow, up the surface of which it was quite frightening to see a ship go climbing high and dry, as a carriage climbs dripping from a ford, but which a moment later, when you saw on the raised and broken surface of the solid plain boats drunkenly heaving, you understood, identical in all these different aspects, to be still the sea<br>
<br>
   Although we are justified in saying that there can be no progress, no discovery in art, but only in the sciences, and that the artist who begins afresh upon his own account an individual effort cannot be either helped or hindered by the efforts of all the others, we must nevertheless admit that, in so far as art brings into prominence certain laws, once an industry has taken those laws and vulgarised them, the art that was first in the field loses, in retrospect, a little of its originality. Since Elstir began to paint, we have grown familiar with what are called ‘admirable’ photographs of scenery and towns. If we press for a definition of what their admirers mean by the epithet, we shall find that it is generally applied to some unusual picture of a familiar object, a picture different from those that we are accustomed to see, unusual and yet true to nature, and for that reason doubly impressive to us because it startles us, makes us emerge from our habits and at the same time brings us back to ourselves by recalling to us an earlier impression. For instance, one of these ‘magnificent’ photographs will illustrate a law of perspective, will shew us some cathedral which we are accustomed to see in the middle of a town, taken instead from a selected point of view from which it will appear to be thirty times the height of the houses and to be thrusting a spur out from the bank of the river, from which it is actually a long way off. Now the effort made by Elstir to reproduce things not as he knew them to be but according to the optical illusions of which our first sight of them is composed, had led him exactly to this point; he gave special emphasis to certain of these laws of perspective, which were thus all the more striking, since his art had been their first interpreter. A river, because of the windings of its course, a bay because of the apparent contact of the cliffs on either side of it, would look as though there had been hollowed out in the heart of the plain or of the mountains a lake absolutely landlocked on every side. In a picture of a view from Balbec painted upon a scorching day in summer an inlet of the sea appeared to be enclosed in walls of pink granite, not to be the sea, which began farther out. The continuity of the ocean was suggested only by the gulls which, wheeling over what, when one looked at the picture, seemed to be solid rock, were as a matter of fact inhaling the moist vapour of the shifting tide. Other laws were discernible in the same canvas, as, at the foot of immense cliffs, the lilliputian grace of white sails on the blue mirror on whose surface they looked like butterflies asleep, and certain contrasts between the depth of the shadows and the pallidity of the light. This play of light and shade, which also photography has rendered commonplace, had interested Elstir so much that at one time he had painted what were almost mirages, in which a castle crowned with a tower appeared as a perfect circle of castle prolonged by a tower at its summit, and at its foot by an inverted tower, whether because the exceptional purity of the atmosphere on a fine day gave the shadow reflected in the water the hardness and brightness of the stone, or because the morning mists rendered the stone as vaporous as the shadow. And similarly, beyond the sea, behind a line of woods, began another sea roseate with the light of the setting sun, which was, in fact, the sky. The light, as it were precipitating new solids, thrust back the hull of the boat on which it fell behind the other hull that was still in shadow, and rearranged like the steps of a crystal staircase what was materially a plane surface, but was broken up by the play of light and shade upon the morning sea. A river running beneath the bridges of a town was caught from a certain point of view so that it appeared entirely dislocated, now broadened into a lake, now narrowed into a rivulet, broken elsewhere by the interruption of a hill crowned with trees among which the burgher would repair at evening to taste the refreshing breeze; and the rhythm of this disintegrated town was assured only by the inflexible uprightness of the steeples which did not rise but rather, following the plumb line of the pendulum marking its cadence as in a triumphal march, seemed to hold in suspense beneath them all the confused mass of houses that rose vaguely in the mist along the banks of the crushed, disjointed stream. And (since Elstir’s earliest work belonged to the time in which a painter would make his landscape attractive by inserting a human figure), on the cliff’s edge or among the mountains, the road, that half human part of nature, underwent, like river or ocean, the eclipses of perspective. And whether a sheer wall of mountain, or the mist blown from a torrent, or the sea prevented the eye from following the continuity of the path, visible to the traveller but not to us, the little human personage in old-fashioned attire seemed often to be stopped short on the edge of an abyss, the path which he had been following ending there, while, a thousand feet above him in those pine-forests, it was with a melting eye and comforted heart that we saw reappear the threadlike whiteness of its dusty surface, hospitable to the wayfaring foot, whereas from us the side of the mountain had hidden, where it turned to avoid waterfall or gully, the intervening bends<br>
<br>
   The effort made by Elstir to strip himself, when face to face with reality, of every intellectual concept, was all the more admirable in that this man who, before sitting down to paint, made himself deliberately ignorant, forgot, in his honesty of purpose, everything that he knew, since what one knows ceases to exist by itself, had in reality an exceptionally cultivated mind. When I confessed to him the disappointment that I had felt upon seeing the porch at Balbec: “What!” he had exclaimed, “you were disappointed by the porch! Why, it’s the finest illustrated Bible that the people have ever had. That Virgin, and all the bas-reliefs telling the story of her life, they are the most loving, the most inspired expression of that endless poem of adoration and praise in which the middle ages extolled the glory of the Madonna. If you only knew, side by side with the most scrupulous accuracy in rendering the sacred text, what exquisite ideas the old carver had, what profound thoughts, what delicious poetry!<br>
<br>
    “A wonderful idea, that great sheet in which the angels are carrying the body of the Virgin, too sacred for them to venture to touch it with their hands”; (I mentioned to him that this theme had been treated also at Saint-André-des-Champs; he had seen photographs of the porch there, and agreed, but pointed out that the bustling activity of those little peasant figures, all hurrying at once towards the Virgin, was not the same thing as the gravity of those two great angels, almost Italian, so springing, so gentle) “the angel who is carrying the Virgin’s soul, to reunite it with her body; in the meeting of the Virgin with Elizabeth, Elizabeth’s gestijre when she touches the Virgin’s Womb and marvels to feel that it is great with child; and the bandaged arm of the midwife who had refused, unless she touched, to believe the Immaculate Conception; and the linen cloth thrown by the Virgin to Saint Thomas to give him a proof of the Resurrection; that veil, too, which the Virgin tears from her own bosom to cover the nakedness of her Son, from Whose Side the Church receives in a chalice the Wine of the Sacrament, while, on His other side the Synagogue, whose kingdom is at an end, has its eyes bandaged, holds a half-broken sceptre and lets fall, with the crown that is slipping from its head, the tables of the old law; and the husband who, on the Day of Judgment, as he helps his young wife to rise from her grave, lays her hand against his own heart to reassure her, to prove to her that it is indeed beating, is that such a trumpery idea, do you think, so stale and commonplace? And the angel who is taking away the sun and the moon, henceforth useless, since it is written that the Light of the Cross shall be seven times brighter than the light of the firmament; and the one who is dipping his hand in the water of the Child’s bath, to see whether it is warm enough; and the one emerging from the clouds to place the crown upon the Virgin’s brow, and all the angels who are leaning from the vault of heaven, between the balusters of the New Jerusalem, and throwing up their arms with terror or joy at the sight of the torments of the wicked or the bliss of the elect! For it is all the circles of heaven, a whole gigantic poem full of theology and symbolism that you have before you there. It is fantastic, mad, divine, a thousand times better than anything you will see in Italy, where for that matter this very tympanum has been carefully copied by sculptors with far less genius. There never was a time when genius was universal; that is all nonsense; it would be going beyond the age of gold. The fellow who carved that front, you may make up your mind that he was every bit as great, that he had just as profound ideas as the men you admire most at the present day. I could shew you what I mean if we went there together. There are certain passages from the Office of the Assumption which have been rendered with a subtilty of expression that Redon himself has never equalled.”<br>
<br>
   This vast celestial vision of which he spoke to me, this gigantic theological poem which, I understood, had been inscribed there in stone, yet when my eyes, big with desire, had opened to gaze upon the front of Balbec church, it was not these things that I had seen. I spoke to him of those great statues of saints, which, mounted on scaffolds, formed a sort of avenue on either side<br>
<br>
    “It starts from the mists of antiquity to end in Jesus Christ,” he explained. “You see on one side His ancestors after the spirit, on the other the Kings of Judah, His ancestors after the flesh. All the ages are there. And if you had looked more closely at what you took for scaffolds you would have been able to give names to the figures standing on them. At the feet of Moses you would have recognised the calf of gold, at Abraham’s the ram and at Joseph’s the demon counselling Potiphar’s wife.”<br>
<br>
   I told him also that I had gone there expecting to find an almost Persian building, and that this had doubtless been one of the chief factors in my disappointment. “Indeed, no,” he assured me, “it is perfectly true. Some parts of it are quite oriental; one of the capitals reproduces so exactly a Persian subject that you cannot account for it by the persistence of Oriental traditions. The carver must have copied some casket brought from the East by explorers.” And he did indeed shew me, later on, the photograph of a capital on which I saw dragons that were almost Chinese devouring one another, but at Balbec this little piece of carving had passed unnoticed by me in the general effect of the building which did not conform to the pattern traced in my mind by the words, ‘an almost Persian church.’<br>
<br>
   The intellectual pleasures which I enjoyed in this studio did not in the least prevent me from feeling, although they enveloped us as it were in spite of ourselves, the warm polish, the sparkling gloom of the place itself and, through the little window framed in honeysuckle, in the avenue that was quite rustic, the resisting dryness of the sun-parched earth, screened only by the diaphanous gauze woven of distance and of a tree-cast shade. Perhaps the unaccountable feeling of comfort which this summer day was giving me came like a tributary to swell the flood of joy that had surged in me at the sight of Elstir’s <i>Carquethuit Harbour</i>.<br>
<br>
   I had supposed Elstir to be a modest man, but I realised my mistake on seeing his face cloud with melancholy when, in a little speech of thanks, I uttered the word ‘fame.’ Men who believe that their work will last — as was the case with Elstir — form the habit of placing that work in a period when they themselves will have crumbled into dust. And thus, by obliging them to reflect on their own extinction, the thought of fame saddens them because it is inseparable from the thought of death. I changed the conversation in the hope of driving away the cloud of ambitious melancholy with which unwittingly I had loaded Elstir’s brow. “Some one advised me once,” I began, thinking of the conversation we had had with Legrandin at Combray, as to which I was glad of an opportunity of learning Elstir’s views, “not to visit Brittany, because it would not be wholesome for a mind with a natural tendency to dream.” “Not at all;” he replied. “When the mind has a tendency to dream, it is a mistake to keep dreams away from it, to ration its dreams. So long as you distract your mind from its dreams, it will not know them for what they are; you will always be being taken in by the appearance of things, because you will not have grasped their true nature. If a little dreaming is dangerous, the cure for it is not to dream less but to dream more, to dream all the time. One must have a thorough understanding of one’s dreams if one is not to be troubled by them; there is a way of separating one’s dreams from one’s life which so often produces good results that I ask myself whether one ought not, at all costs, to try it, simply as a preventive, just as certain surgeons make out that we ought, to avoid the risk of appendicitis later on, to have all our appendices taken out when we are children.”<br>
<br>
   Elstir and I had meanwhile been walking about the studio, and had reached the window that looked across the garden on to a narrow avenue, a side-street that was almost a country lane. We had gone there to breathe the cooler air of the late afternoon. I supposed myself to be nowhere near the girls of the little band, and it was only by sacrificing for once the hope of seeing them that I had yielded to my grandmother’s prayers and had gone to see Elstir. For where the thing is to be found that we are seeking we never know, and often we steadily, for a long time, avoid the place to which, for quite different reasons, everyone has been asking us to go. But we never suspect that we shall there see the very person of whom we are thinking. I looked out vaguely over the country road which, outside the studio, passed quite close to it but did not belong to Elstir. Suddenly there appeared on it, coming along it at a rapid pace, the young bicyclist of the little band, with, over her dark hair, her polo-cap pulled down towards her plump cheeks, her eyes merry and almost importunate; and on that auspicious path, miraculously filled with promise of delights, I saw her beneath the trees throw to Elstir the smiling greeting of a friend, a rainbow that bridged the gulf for me between our terraqueous world and regions which I had hitherto regarded as inaccessible. She even came up to give her hand to the painter, though without stopping, and I could see that she had a tiny beauty spot on her chin. “Do you know that girl, sir?” I asked Elstir, realising that he could if he chose make me known to her, could invite us both to the house. And this peaceful studio with its rural horizon was at once filled with a surfeit of delight such as a child might feel in a house where he was already happily playing when he learned that, in addition, out of that bounteousness which enables lovely things and noble hosts to increase their gifts beyond all measure, there was being prepared for him a sumptuous repast. Elstir told me that she was called Albertine Simonet, and gave me the names also of her friends, whom I described to him with sufficient accuracy for him to identify them almost without hesitation. I had, with regard to their social position, made a mistake, but not the mistake that I usually made at Balbec. I was always ready to take for princes the sons of shopkeepers when they appeared on horseback. This time I had placed in an interloping class the daughters of a set of respectable people, extremely rich, belonging to the world of industry and business. It was the class which, on first thoughts, interested me least, since it held for me neither the mystery of the lower orders nor that of a society such as the Guermantes frequented. And no doubt if an inherent quality, a rank which they could never forfeit, had not been conferred on them, in my dazzled eyes, by the glaring vacuity of the seaside life all round them, I should perhaps not have succeeded in resisting and overcoming the idea that they were the daughters of prosperous merchants. I could not help marvelling to see how the French middle class was a wonderful studio full of sculpture of the noblest and most varied kind. What unimagined types, what richness of invention in the character of their faces, what firmness, what freshness, what simplicity in their features. The shrewd old moneychangers from whose loins these Dianas and these nymphs had sprung seemed to me to have been the greatest of statuaries. Before I had time to register the social metamorphosis of these girls — so are these discoveries of a mistake, these modifications of the notion one has of a person instantaneous as a chemical combination — there was already installed behind their faces, so street-arab in type that I had taken them for the mistresses of racing bicyclists, of boxing champions, the idea that they might easily be connected with the family of some lawyer or other whom we knew. I was barely conscious of what was meant by Albertine Simonet; she had certainly no conception of what she was one day to mean to me. Even the name, Simonet, which I had already heard spoken on the beach, if I had been asked to write it down I should have spelt with a double ‘n,’ never dreaming of the importance which this family attached to there being but one in their name. In proportion as we descend the social scale our snobbishness fastens on to mere nothings which are perhaps no more null than the distinctions observed by the aristocracy, but, being more obscure, more peculiar to the individual, take us more by surprise. Possibly there had been Simonnets who had done badly in business, or something worse still even. The fact remains that the Simonets never failed, it appeared, to be annoyed if anyone doubled their ‘n.’ They wore the air of being the only Simonets in the world with one ‘n’ instead of two, and were as proud of it, perhaps, as the Montmorency family were of being the premier barons of France. I asked Elstir whether these girls lived at Balbec; yes, he told me, some of them at any rate. The villa in which one of them lived was at that very spot, right at the end of the beach, where the cliffs of Canapville began. As this girl was a great friend of Albertine Simonet, this was another reason for me to believe that it was indeed the latter whom I had met that day when I was with my grandmother. There were of course so many of those little streets running down to the beach, and all at the same angle, that I could not have pointed out exactly which of them it had been. One would like always to remember a thing accurately, but at the time one’s vision was clouded. And yet that Albertine and the girl whom I had seen going to her friend’s house were one and the same person was a practical certainty. In spite of which, whereas the countless images that have since been furnished me by the dark young golfer, however different they may have been from one another, have overlaid one another (because I now know that they all belong to her), and if I retrace the thread of my memories I can, under cover of that identity, and as though along a tunnelled passage, pass through all those images in turn without losing my consciousness of the same person behind them all, if, on the other hand, I wish to revert to the girl whom I passed that day when I was with my grandmother, I must escape first into freer air. I am convinced that it is Albertine whom I find there, the same girl as her who would often stop dead among her moving comrades, in her walk along the foreground of the sea; but all those more recent images remain separate from that earlier one because I am unable to confer on her retrospectively an identity which she had not for me at the moment in which she caught my eye; whatever assurance I may derive from the law of probabilities, that girl with plump cheeks who stared at me so boldly from the angle of the little street and the beach, and by whom I believe that I might have been loved, I have never, in the strict sense of the words, seen again<br>
<br>
   My hesitation between the different girls of the little band, all of whom retained something of the collective charm which had at first disturbed me, combined with the reasons already given to allow me later on, even at the time of my greater — my second — passion for Albertine, a sort of intermittent and very brief liberty to abstain from loving her. From having strayed among all her friends before it finally concentrated itself on her, my love kept, now and then, between itself and the image of Albertine a certain ‘play’ of light and shade which enabled it, like a badly fitted lamp, to flit over the surface of each of the others before settling its focus upon her; the connexion between the pain which I felt in my heart and the memory of Albertine did not seem to me necessary; I might perhaps have managed to co-ordinate it with the image of another person, Which enabled me, in a momentary flash, to banish reality altogether, not only external reality, as in my love for Gilberte (which I had recognised to be an internal state in which I drew from myself alone the particular quality, the special character of the person whom I loved, everything that rendered her indispensable to my happiness), but even the other reality, internal and purely subjective<br>
<br>
    “Not a day passes but one or the other of them comes by here, and looks in for a minute or two,” Elstir told me, plunging me in despair when I thought that if I had gone to see him at once, when my grandmother had begged me to do so, I should, in all probability, long since have made Albertine’s acquaintance<br>
<br>
   She had passed on; from the studio she was no longer in sight. I supposed that she had gone to join her friends on the ‘front.’ Could I have appeared there suddenly with Elstir, I should have got to know them all. I thought of endless pretexts for inducing him to take a turn with me on the beach. I had no longer the same peace of mind as before the apparition of the girl in the frame of the little window; so charming until then in its fringe of honeysuckle, and now so drearily empty. Elstir caused me a joy that was tormenting also when he said that he would go a little way with me, but that he must first finish the piece of work on which he was engaged. It was a flower study but not one of any of the flowers, portraits of which I would rather have commissioned him to paint than the portrait of a person, so that I might learn from the revelation of his genius what I had so often sought in vain from the flowers themselves — hawthorn white and pink, cornflowers, apple-blossom. Elstir as he worked talked botany to me, but I scarcely listened; he was no longer sufficient in himself, he was now only the necessary intermediary between these girls and me; the distinction which, only a few moments ago, his talent had still given him in my eyes was now worthless save in so far as it might confer a little on me also in the eyes of the little band to whom I should be presented by him<br>
<br>
   I paced up and down the room, impatient for him to finish what he was doing; I picked up and examined various sketches, any number of which were stacked against the walls. In this way I happened to bring to light a water-colour which evidently belonged to a much earlier period in Elstir’s life, and gave me that particular kind of enchantment which is diffused by works of art not only deliriously executed but representing a subject so singular and so seductive that it is to it that we attribute a great deal of their charm, as if the charm were something that the painter had merely to uncover, to observe, realised already in a material form by nature, and to reproduce in art. That such objects can exist, beautiful quite apart from the painter’s interpretation of them, satisfies a sort of innate materialism in us, against which our reason contends and acts as a counterpoise to the abstractions of aesthetics. It was — this water-colour — the portrait of a young woman, by no means beautiful but of a curious type, in a close-fitting mob-cap not unlike a ‘billy-cock’ hat, trimmed with a ribbon of cherry-coloured silk; in one of her mittened hands was a lighted cigarette, while the other held, level with her knee, a sort of broad-brimmed garden hat, nothing more than a fire screen of plaited straw to keep off the sun. On a table by her side, a tall vase filled with pink carnations. Often (and it was the case here) the singularity of such works is due principally to their having been executed in special conditions for which we do not at first sight make proper allowance, if, for instance, the strange attire of a feminine model is her costume for a masked ball, or conversely the scarlet cloak which an elderly man looks as though he had put on to humour some whim in the painter is his gown as a professor or alderman or his cardinal’s cassock. The ambiguous character of the person whose portrait now confronted me arose, without my understanding it, from the fact that she was a young actress of an earlier generation half dressed for a part. But the cap or hat, beneath which the hair stuck out but was cut short, the velvet coat opening without lapels over a white shirt-front, made me hesitate as to the period of the clothes and the sex of the model, so that I did not know what it was exactly that I was holding before my eyes, unless simply the brightest coloured of these scraps of painting. And the pleasure which it afforded me was disturbed only by the fear that Elstir, by delaying further, would make me miss the girls, for the sun was now declining and hung low in the little window. Nothing in this water-colour was merely stated there as a fact and painted because of its utility to the composition, the costume because the young woman must be wearing something, the vase to hold the flowers. The glass of the vase, cherished for its own sake, seemed to be holding the water in which the stems of the carnations were dipped in something as limpid, almost as liquid as itself; the woman’s dress encompassed her in a manner that had an independent, a brotherly charm, and, if the works of man can compete in charm with the wonders of nature, as delicate, as pleasing to the touch of the eye, as freshly painted as the fur of a cat, the petals of a flower, the feathers of a dove. The whiteness of the shirt-front, fine as driven rain, with its gay pleats gathered into little bells like lilies of the valley, was starred with bright gleams of light from the room, as sharply edged and as finely shaded as though they had been posies of flowers stitched on the woven lawn. And the velvet of the coat, brilliant with a milky sheen, had here and there a roughness, a scoring, a shagginess on its surface which made one think of the crumpled brightness of the carnations in the vase. But above all one felt that Elstir, sublimely indifferent to whatever immoral suggestion there might be in this disguise of a young actress for whom the talent with which she would play her part on the stage was doubtless of less importance than the irritant attraction which she would offer to the jaded or depraved senses of some of her audience, had on the contrary fastened upon those ambiguous points as on an aesthetic element which deserved to be brought into prominence, and which he had done everything in his power to emphasise. Along the lines of the face, the latent sex seemed to be on the point of confessing itself to be that of a somewhat boyish girl, then vanished and farther on reappeared with a suggestion rather of an effeminate youth, vicious and pensive, then fled once more to remain uncapturable. The dreamy sadness in the expression of her eyes, by the mere fact of its contrast with the accessories belonging to the world of love-making and play-acting, was not the least disturbing element in the picture. One imagined moreover that it must be feigned, and that the young person who seemed ready to submit to caresses in this provoking costume had probably thought it effective to enhance the provocation with this romantic expression of a secret longing, an unspoken grief. At the foot of the picture was inscribed “Miss Sacripant: October, 1872.” I could not contain my admiration. “Oh, it’s nothing, only a rough sketch I did when I was young; it was a costume for a variety show. It’s all ages ago now.” “And what has become of the model?” A bewilderment provoked by my words preceded on Elstir’s face the indifferent, absent-minded air which, a moment later, he displayed there. “Quick, give it to me!” he cried, “I hear Madame Elstir coming, and, though, I assure you, the young person in the billy-cock hat never played any part in my life, still there’s no point in my wife’s coming in and finding it staring her in the face. I have kept it only as an amusing sidelight on the theatre of those days.” And, before putting it away behind the pile, Elstir, who perhaps had not set eyes on the sketch for years, gave it his careful scrutiny. “I must keep just the head,” he murmured, “the lower part is really too shockingly bad, the hands are a beginner’s work.” I was miserable at the arrival of Mme. Elstir, who could only delay us still further. The window sill was already aglow. Our excursion would be a pure waste of time. There was no longer the slightest chance of our seeing the girls, consequently it mattered now not at all how soon Mme. Elstir left us or how long she stayed. Not that she did stay for any length of time. I found her most tedious; she might have been beautiful, once, at twenty, driving an ox in the Roman Campagna, but her dark hair was streaked with grey and she was common without being simple, because she believed that a pompous manner and majestic attitudes were required by her statuesque beauty, which, however, advancing age had robbed of all its charm. She was dressed with the utmost simplicity. And it was touching, but at the same time surprising to hear Elstir, whenever he opened his mouth, and with a respectful gentleness, as if merely uttering the words moved him to tenderness and veneration, repeat: “My beautiful Gabrielle!” Later on, when I had become familiar with Elstir’s mythological paintings, Mme. Elstir acquired beauty in my eyes also. I understood then that to a certain ideal type illustrated by certain lines, certain arabesques which reappeared incessantly throughout his work, to a certain canon of art he had attributed a character that was almost divine, since the whole of his time, all the mental effort of which he was capable, in a word his whole life he had consecrated to the task of distinguishing those lines as clearly and of reproducing them as faithfully as possible. What such an ideal inspired in Elstir was indeed a cult so solemn, so exacting that it never allowed him to be satisfied with what he had achieved; was the most intimate part of himself, and so he had never been able to look at it from a detached standpoint, to extract emotion from it, until the day on which he encountered it realised outside, apart from himself, in the body of a woman, the body of her who in due course became Mme. Elstir and in whom he had been able (as one is able only with something that is not oneself) to find it meritorious, moving, god-like. How comforting, moreover, to let his lips rest upon that Beauty which hitherto he had been obliged with so great labour to extract from ^ within himself, whereas now, mysteriously incarnate, it offered itself to him in a series of communions, filled with saving grace. Elstir at this period was no longer in that early youth in which we look only to the power of our own mind for the realisation of our ideal. He was nearing the age at which we count on bodily satisfactions to stimulate the forces of the brain, at which the exhaustion of the brain inclining us to materialism and the diminution of our activity to the possibility of influences passively received, begin to make us admit that there may indeed be certain bodies, certain callings, certain rhythms that are privileged, realising so naturally our ideal that even without genius, merely by copying the movement of a shoulder, the tension of a throat, we can achieve a masterpiece, it is the age at which we like to caress Beauty with our eyes objectively, outside ourselves, to have it near us, in a tapestry, in a lovely sketch by Titian picked up in a second-hand shop, in a mistress as lovely as Titian’s sketch. When I understood this I could no longer look without pleasure at Mme. Elstir, and her body began to lose its heaviness, for I filled it with an idea, the idea that she was an immaterial creature, a portrait by Elstir. She was one for me, and for him also I dare say. The facts of life have no meaning for the artist, they are to him merely an opportunity for exposing the naked blaze of his genius. One feels unmistakably, when one sees side by side ten portraits of different people painted by Elstir, that they are all, first and foremost, Elstirs. Only, after this rising tide of genius, which sweeps over and submerges a man’s life, when the brain begins to tire, gradually the balance is upset and, like a river that resumes its course after the counter-flow of a spring tide, it is life that once more takes the upper hand. While the first period lasted, the artist has gradually evolved the law, the formula of his unconscious gift. He knows what situations, should he be a novelist — if a painter, what scenes — furnish him with the subject matter, which may be anything in the world but, whatever it is, is essential to his researches as a laboratory might be of a workshop. He knows that he has created his masterpieces out of effects of attenuated light, the action of remorse upon consciousness of guilt, out of women posed beneath trees or half-immersed in water, like statues. A day will come when, owing to the exhaustion of his brain, he will no longer have the strength, when provided with those materials which his genius was won't to use, to make the intellectual effort which alone can produce his work, and will yet continue to seek them out, happy when he finds himself in their presence, because of the spiritual pleasure, the allurement to work that they arouse in him; and, surrounding them besides with a kind of hedge of superstition as if they were superior to all things else, as if in them already dwelt a great part of the work of art which they might be said to carry within them ready made, he will confine himself to the company, to the adoration of his models. He will hold endless conversations with the repentant criminals whose remorse, whose regeneration formed, when he still wrote, the subject of his novels; he will buy a country house in a district where mists attenuate the light, he will spend long hours gazing at the limbs of bathing women; will collect sumptuous stuffs. And thus the beauty of life, a phase that has to some extent lost its meaning, a stage beyond the boundaries of art at which I had already seen Swann come to rest, was that also which, by a slackening of the creative ardour, idolatry of the forms which had inspired it, desire to avoid effort, must ultimately arrest an Elstir’s progress<br>
<br>
   At last he had applied the final brush-stroke to his flowers; I sacrificed a minute to look at them; I acquired no merit by the act, for I knew that there was no chance now of our finding the girls on the beach; and yet, had I believed them to be still there, and that these wasted moments would make me miss them, I should have stopped to look none the less, for I should have told myself that Elstir was more interested in his flowers than in my meeting with the girls. My grandmother’s nature, a nature that was the exact counterpart of my complete egoism, was nevertheless reflected in certain aspects of my own. In circumstances in which someone to whom I was indifferent, for whom I had always made a show of affection or respect, ran the risk merely of some unpleasantness whereas I was in real danger, I could not have done otherwise than commiserate with him on his annoyance as though it had been something important, and treat my own danger as nothing, because I would feel that these were the proportions in which he must see things. To be quite accurate, I would go even further, and not only not complain of the danger in which I myself stood but go half-way to meet it, and with that which involved other people try, on the contrary, were I to increase the risk of my being caught myself, to avert it from them. The reasons for this are several, none of which does me the slightest credit. One is that if, while only my reason was employed, I have always believed in self-preservation, whenever in the course of my existence I have found myself obsessed by moral anxieties, or merely by nervous scruples, so puerile often that I dare not enumerate them here, if an unforeseen circumstance then arose, involving for me the risk of being killed, this new preoccupation was so trivial in comparison with the others that I welcomed it with a sense of relief, almost of hilarity. Thus I find myself, albeit the least courageous of men, to have known that feeling which has always seemed to me, in my reasoning moods, so foreign to my nature, so inconceivable, the intoxication of danger. But even although I were, when any, even a deadly peril threatened me, passing through an entirely calm and happy phase, I could not, were I with another person, refrain from sheltering him behind me and choosing for myself the post of danger. When a sufficient store of experience had taught me that I invariably acted, and enjoyed acting, thus, I discovered — and was deeply ashamed by the discovery — that it was because, in contradiction of what I had always believed and asserted, I was extremely sensitive to the opinions of others. Not that this kind of unconfessed self-esteem is in any sense vanity or conceit. For what might satisfy one or other of those failings would give me no pleasure, and I have always refrained from indulging them. But with the people in whose company I have succeeded in concealing most effectively the slight advantages a knowledge of which might have given them a less derogatory idea of myself, I have never been able to deny myself the pleasure of shewing them that I take more trouble to avert the risk of death from their path than from my own. As my motive is then self-esteem and not valour, I find it quite natural that in any crisis they should act differently. I am far from blaming them for it, as I should perhaps if I had been moved by a sense of duty, a duty which would seem to me, in that case, to be as incumbent upon them as upon myself. On the contrary, I feel that it is eminently sensible of them to safeguard their lives, though at the same time I cannot prevent my own safety from receding into the background, which is particularly silly and culpable of me since I have come to realise that the lives of many of the people in front of whom I plant myself when a bomb bursts are more valueless even than my own. However, on the day of this first visit to Elstir, the time was still distant at which I was to become conscious of this difference in value, and there was no question of danger, but simply — a harbinger this of that pernicious self-esteem — the question of my not appearing to attach to the pleasure which I so ardently desired more importance than to the work which the painter had still to finish. It was finished at last. And, once we were out of doors, I discovered that — so long were the days still at this season — it was not so late as I had supposed; we strolled down to the ‘front.’ What stratagems I employed to keep Elstir standing at the spot where I thought that the girls might still come past. Pointing to the cliffs that towered beside us, I kept on asking him to tell me about them, so as to make him forget the time and stay there a little longer. I felt that we had a better chance of waylaying the little band if we moved towards the end of the beach. “I should like to look at those cliffs with you from a little nearer,” I said to him, having noticed that one of the girls was in the habit of going in that direction. “And as we go, do tell me about Carquethuit. I should so like to see Carquethuit,” I went on, without thinking that the so novel character which manifested itself with such force m Elstir’sCarquethuit Harbour, might belong perhaps rather to the painter’s vision than to any special quality in the place itself. “Since I’ve seen your picture, I think that is where I should most like to go, there and to the Pointe du Raz, but of course that would be quite a journey from here.” “Yes, and besides, even if it weren’t nearer, I should advise you perhaps all the same to visit Carquethuit,” he replied. “The Pointe du Raz is magnificent, but after all it is simply the high cliff of Normandy or Brittany which you know already. Carquethuit is quite different, with those rocks bursting from a level shore. I know nothing in France like it, it reminds me rather of what one sees in some parts of Florida. It is most interesting, and for that matter extremely wild too. It is between Clitourps and Nehomme; you know how desolate those parts are; the sweep of the coast-line is delicious. Here, the coast-line is like anywhere else; but along there I can’t tell you what charm it has, what softness.”<br>
<br>
   Night was falling; it was time to be turning homewards; I was escorting Elstir in the direction of his villa when suddenly, as it were Mephistopheles springing up before Faust, there appeared at the end of the avenue — like simply an objectification, unreal, diabolical, of the temperament diametrically opposed to my own, of the semi-barbarous and cruel vitality of which I, in my weakness, my excess of tortured sensibility and intellectuality was so destitute — a few spots of the essence impossible to mistake for anything else in the world, a few spores of the zoophytic band of girls, who wore an air of not having seen me but were unquestionably, for all that, proceeding as they advanced to pass judgment on me in their ironic vein. Feeling that a collision between them and us was now inevitable, and that Elstir would be certain to call me, I turned my back, like a bather preparing to meet the shock of a wave; I stopped dead and, leaving my eminent companion to pursue his way, remained where I was, stooping, as if I had suddenly become engrossed in it, towards the window of the curiosity shop which we happened to be passing at the moment. I was not sorry to give the appearance of being able to think of something other than these girls, and I was already dimly aware that when Elstir did call me up to introduce me to them I should wear that sort of challenging expression which betokens not surprise but the wish to appear as though one were surprised — so far is every one of us a bad actor, or everyone else a good thought-reader; — that I should even go so far as to point a finger to my breast, as who should ask “It is me, really, that you want?” and then run to join him, my head lowered in compliance and docility and my face coldly masking my annoyance at being torn from the study of old pottery in order to be introduced to people whom I had no wish to know. Meanwhile I explored the window and waited for the moment in which my name, shouted by Elstir, would come to strike me like an expected and innocuous bullet. The certainty of being introduced to these girls had had the result of making me not only feign complete indifference to them, but actually to feel it. Inevitable from this point, the pleasure of knowing them began at once to shrink, became less to me than the pleasure of talking to Saint-Loup, of dining with my grandmother, of making, in the neighbourhood of Balbec, excursions which I would regret the probability, in consequence of my having to associate with people who could scarcely be much interested in old buildings, of my being forced to abandon. Moreover, what diminished the pleasure which I was about to feel was not merely the imminence but the incoherence of its realisation. Laws as precise as those of hydrostatics maintain the relative position of the images which we form in a fixed order, which the coming event at once upsets. Elstir was just about to call me. This was not at all the fashion in which I had so often, on the beach, in my bedroom, imagined myself making these girls’ acquaintance. What was about to happen was a different event, for which I was not prepared. I recognised neither my desire nor its object; I regretted almost that I had come out with Elstir. But, above all, the shrinking of the pleasure that I expected to feel was due to the certainty that nothing, now, could take that pleasure from me. And it resumed, as though by some latent elasticity in itself, its whole extent when it ceased to be subjected to the pressure of that certainty, at the moment when, having decided to turn my head, I saw Elstir, standing where he had stopped a few feet away with the girls, bidding them good-bye. The face of the girl who stood nearest to him, round and plump and glittering with the light in her eyes, reminded me of a cake on the top of which a place has been kept for a morsel of blue sky. Her eyes, even when fixed on an object, gave one the impression of motion, just as on days of high wind the air, although invisible, lets us perceive the speed with which it courses between us and the unchanging azure. For a moment her gaze intersected mine, like those travelling skies on stormy days which hurry after a rain-cloud that moves less rapidly than they, overtake, touch, cover, pass it and are gone; but they do not know one another, and are soon driven far apart. So our eyes were for a moment confronted, neither pair knowing what the celestial continent that lay before their gaze held of future blessing or disaster. Only at the moment when her gaze was directly coincident with mine, without slackening its movement it grew perceptibly duller. So on a starry night the wind-swept moon passes behind a cloud and veils her brightness for a moment, but soon will shine again. But Elstir had already said goodbye to the girls, and had never summoned me. They disappeared down a cross street; he came towards me. My whole plan was spoiled<br>
<br>
   I have said that Albertine had not seemed to me that day to be the same as on previous days and that afterwards, each time I saw her, she was to appear different. But I felt at that moment that certain modifications in the appearance, the importance, the stature of a person may also be due to the variability of certain states of consciousness interposed between that person and us. One of those that play an important part in such transformations is belief; that evening my belief, then the vanishing of my belief, that I was about to know Albertine had, with a few seconds’ interval only, rendered her almost insignificant, then infinitely precious in my sight; some years later, the belief, then the disappearance of the belief, that Albertine was faithful to me brought about similar changes<br>
<br>
   Of course, long ago, at Combfay, I had seen shrink or stretch, according to the time of day, according as I was entering one or the other of the two dominant moods that governed my sensibility in turn, my grief at not having my mother with me, as imperceptible all afternoon as is the moon’s light when the sun is shining, and then, when night had come, reigning alone in my anxious heart in the place of recent memories now obliterated. But on that day at Balbec, when I saw that Elstir was leaving the girls and had not called me, I learned for the first time that the variations in the importance which a pleasure or a pain has in our eyes may depend not merely on this alternation of two moods, but on the displacement of invisible beliefs, such, for example, as make death seem to us of no account because they bathe it in a glow of unreality, and thus enable us to attach importance to our attending an evening party, which would lose much of its charm for if, on the announcement that we were sentenced to die by the guillotine, the belief that had bathed the party in its warm glow was instantly shattered; and this part that belief plays, it is true that something in me was aware of it; this was my will; but its knowledge is vain if the mind, the heart continue in ignorance; these last act in good faith when they believe that we are anxious to forsake a mistress to whom our will alone knows that we are still attached. This is because they are clouded by the belief that we shall see her again at any moment. But let this belief be shattered, let them suddenly become aware that this mistress is gone from us for ever, then the mind and heart, having lost their focus, are driven like mad things, the meanest pleasure becomes infinitely great<br>
<br>
   Variance of a belief, annulment also of love, which, pre-existent and mobile, comes to rest at the image of any one woman simply because that woman will be almost impossible of attainment. Thenceforward we think not so much of the woman of whom we find difficult in forming an exact picture, as of the means of getting to know her. A whole series of agonies develops and is sufficient to fix our love definitely upon her who is its almost unknown object. Our love becomes immense; we never dream how small a place in it the real woman occupies. And if suddenly, as at the moment when I had seen Elstir stop to talk to the girls, we cease to be uneasy, to suffer pain, since it is this pain that is the whole of our love, it seems to us as though love had abruptly vanished at the moment when at length we grasp the prey to whose value we had not given enough thought before. What did I know of Albertine? One or two glimpses of a profile against the sea, less beautiful, assuredly, than those of Veronese’s women whom I ought, had I been guided by purely aesthetic reasons, to have preferred to her. By what other reasons could I be guided, since, my anxiety having subsided, I could recapture only those mute profiles; I possessed nothing of her besides. Since my first sight of Albertine I had meditated upon her daily, a thousandfold, I had carried on with what I called by her name an interminable unspoken dialogue in which I made her question me, answer me, think and act, and in the infinite series of imaginary Albertines who followed one after the other in my fancy, hour after hour, the real Albertine, a glimpse caught on the beach, figured only at the head, just as the actress who creates a part, the star, appears, out of a long series of performances, in the few first alone. That Albertine was scarcely more than a silhouette, all that was superimposed being of my own growth, so far when we are in love does the contribution that we ourself make outweigh — even if we consider quantity only — those that come to us from the beloved object. And the same is true of love that is given its full effect. There are loves that manage not only to be formed but to subsist around a very little core — even among those whose prayer has been answered after the flesh. An old drawing-master who had taught my grandmother had been presented by some obscure mistress with a daughter. The mother died shortly after the birth of her child, and the drawing-master was so broken-hearted that he did not long survive her. In the last months of his life my grandmother and some of the Combray ladies, who had never liked to make any allusion in the drawing-master’s presence to the woman, with whom, for that matter, he had not officially ‘lived’ and had had comparatively slight relations, took it into their heads to ensure the little girl’s future by combining to purchase an annuity for her. It was my grandmother who suggested this; several of her friends made difficulties; after all was the child really such a very interesting case, was she even the child of her reputed father; with women like that, it was never safe to say. Finally, everything was settled. The child came to thank the ladies. She was plain, and so absurdly like the old drawing-master as to remove every shadow of doubt; her hair being the only nice thing about her, one of the ladies said to her father, who had come with her: “What pretty hair she has.” And thinking that now, the woman who had sinned being dead and the old man only half alive, a discreet allusion to that past of which they had always pretended to know nothing could do no harm, my grandmother added: “It runs in families. Did her mother have pretty hair like that?” “I don’t know,” was the old man’s quaint answer. “I never saw her except with a hat on.”<br>
<br>
   But I must not keep Elstir waiting. I caught sight of myself in a glass. To add to the disaster of my not having been introduced to the girls, I noticed that my necktie was all crooked, my hat left long wisps of hair shewing, which did not become me; but it was a piece of luck, all the same, that they should have seen me, even thus attired, in Elstir’s company and so could not forget me; also that I should have put on, that morning, at my grandmother’s suggestion, my smart waistcoat, when I might so easily have been wearing one that was simply hideous, and be carrying my best stick. For while an event for which we are longing never happens quite in the way we have been expecting, failing the advantages on which we supposed that we might count, others present themselves for which we never hoped, and make up for our disappointment; and we have been so dreading the worst that in the end we are inclined to feel that, taking one thing with another, chance has, on the whole, been rather kind to us<br>
<br>
    “I did so much want to know them,” I said as I reached Elstir. “Then why did you stand a mile away?” These were his actual words, not that they expressed what was in his mind, since, if his desire had been to grant mine, to call me up to him would have been quite easy, but perhaps because he had heard phrases of this sort, in familiar use among common people when they are in the wrong, and because even great men are in certain respects much the same as common people, take their everyday excuses from the same common stock just as they get their daily bread from the same baker; or it may be that such expressions (which ought, one might almost say, to be read ‘backwards,’ since their literal interpretation is the opposite of the truth) are the instantaneous effect, the negative exposure of a reflex action. “They were in a hurry.” It struck me that of course they must have stopped him from summoning a person who did not greatly attract them; otherwise he would not have failed, after all the questions that I had put to him about them, and the interest which he must have seen that I took in them, to call me. “We were speaking just now of Carquethuit,” he began, as we walked towards his villa. “I have done a little sketch, in which you can see much better how the beach curves. The painting is not bad, but it is different. If you will allow me, just to cement our friendship, I would like to give you the sketch,” he went on, for the people who refuse us the objects of our desire are always ready to offer us something else<br>
<br>
    “I should very much like, if you have such a thing, a photograph of the little picture of Miss Sacripant. ‘Sacripant’— that’s not a real name, surely?” “It is the name of a character the sitter played in a stupid little musical comedy.” “But, I assure you, sir, I have never set eyes on her; you look as though you thought that I knew her.” Elstir was silent. “It isn’t Mme. Swann, before she was married?” I hazarded, in one of those sudden fortuitous stumblings upon the truth, which are rare enough in all conscience, and yet give, in the long run, a certain cumulative support to the theory of presentiments, provided that one takes care to forget all the wrong guesses that would invalidate it. Elstir did not reply. The portrait was indeed that of Odette de Crécy. She had preferred not to keep it for many reasons, some of them obvious. But there were others less apparent. The portrait dated from before the point at which Odette, disciplining her features, had made of her face and figure that creation the broad outlines of which her hairdressers, her dressmakers, she herself — in her way of standing, of speaking, of smiling, of moving her hands, her eyes, of thinking — were to respect throughout the years to come. It required the vitiated tastes of a surfeited lover to make Swann prefer to all the countless photographs of the ‘sealed pattern’ Odette which was his charming wife the little photographs which he kept in his room and in which, beneath a straw hat trimmed with pansies, you saw a thin young woman, not even good-looking, with bunched-out hair and drawn features<br>
<br>
   But apart from this, had the portrait been not anterior like Swann’s favourite photograph, to the systématisation of Odette’s features in a fresh type, majestic and charming, but subsequent to it, Elstir’s vision would alone have sufficed to disorganise that type. Artistic genius in its reactions is like those extremely high temperatures which have the power to disintegrate combinations of atoms which they proceed to combine afresh in a diametrically opposite order, following another type. All that artificially harmonious whole into which a woman has succeeded in bringing her limbs and features, the persistence of which every day, before going out, she studies in her glass, changing the angle of her hat, smoothing her hair, exercising the sprightliness in her eyes, so as to ensure its continuity, that harmony the keen eye of the great painter instantly destroys, substituting for it a rearrangement of the woman’s features such as will satisfy a certain pictorial ideal of femininity which he carries in his head. Similarly it often happens that, after a certain age, the eye of a great seeker after truth will find everywhere the elements necessary to establish those relations which alone are of interest to him. Like those craftsmen, those players who, instead of making a fuss and asking for what they cannot have, content themselves with the instrument that comes to their hand, the artist might say of anything, no matter what, that it would serve his purpose. Thus a cousin of the Princesse de Luxembourg, a beauty of the most queenly type, having succumbed to a form of art which was new at that time, had asked the leading painter of the naturalist school to do her portrait. At once the artist’s eye had found what he sought everywhere in life. And on his canvas there appeared, in place of the proud lady, a street-boy, and behind him a vast, sloping, purple background which made one think of the Place Pigalle. But even without going so far as that, not only will the portrait of a woman by a great artist not seek in the least to give satisfaction to various demands on the woman’s part — such as for instance, when she begins to age, make her have herself photographed in dresses that are almost those of a young girl, which bring out her still youthful figure and make her appear like the sister, or even the daughter of her own daughter, who, if need be, is tricked out for the occasion as a ‘perfect fright’ by her side — it will, on the contrary, emphasise those very drawbacks which she seeks to hide, and which (as for instance a feverish, that is to say a livid complexion) are all the more tempting to him since they give his picture ‘character’; they are quite enough, however, to destroy all the illusions of the ordinary man who, when he sees the picture, sees crumble into dust the ideal which the woman herself has so proudly sustained for him, which has placed her in her unique, her unalterable form so far apart, so far above the rest of humanity. Fallen now, represented otherwise than in her own type in which she sat unassailably enthroned, she is become nothing more than just an ordinary woman, in the legend of whose superiority we have lost all faith. In this type we are so accustomed to regard as included not only the beauty of an Odette but her personality, her identity, that standing before the portrait which has thus transposed her from it we are inclined to protest not simply “How plain he has made her!” but “Why, it isn’t the least bit like her!” We find it hard to believe that it can be she. We do not recognise her. And yet there is a person there on the canvas whom we are quite conscious of having seen before. But that person is not Odette; the face of the person, her body, her general appearance seem familiar. They recall to us not this particular woman who never held herself like that, whose natural pose had no suggestion of any such strange and teasing arabesque in its outlines, but other women, all the women whom Elstir has ever painted, women whom invariably, however they may differ from one another, he has chosen to plant thus on his canvas facing you, with an arched foot thrust out from under the skirt, a large round hat in one hand, symmetrically corresponding at the level of the knee which it hides to what also appears as a disc, higher up in the picture: the face. And furthermore, not only does a portrait by the hand of genius disintegrate and destroy a woman’s type, as it has been denned by her coquetry and her selfish conception of beauty, but if it is also old, it is not content with ageing the original in the same way as a photograph ages its sitter, by shewing her dressed in the fashions of long ago. In a portrait, it is not only the manner the woman then had of dressing that dates it, there is also the manner the artist had of painting. And this, Elstir’s earliest manner, was the most damaging of birth certificates for Odette because it not only established her, as did her photographs of the same period, as the younger sister of various time-honoured courtesans, but made her portrait contemporary with the countless portraits that Manet or Whistler had painted of all those vanished models, models who already belonged to oblivion or to history<br>
<br>
   It was along this train of thought, meditated in silence by the side of Elstir as I accompanied him to his door, that I was being led by the discovery that I had just made of the identity of his model, when this original discovery caused me to make a second, more disturbing still, involving the identity of the artist. He had painted the portrait of Odette de Crécy. Could it possibly be that this man of genius, this sage, this eremite, this philosopher with his marvellous flow of conversation, who towered over everyone and everything, was the foolish, corrupt little painter who had at one time been ‘taken up’ by the Verdurins? I asked him if he had known them, whether by any chance it was he that they used to call M. Biche. He answered me in the affirmative, with no trace of embarrassment, as if my question referred to a period in his life that was ended and already somewhat remote, with no suspicion of what a cherished illusion his words were shattering in me, until looking up he read my disappointment upon my face. His own assumed an expression of annoyance. And, as we were now almost at the gate of his house, a man of less outstanding eminence, in heart and brain, might simply have said ‘good-bye’ to me, a trifle dryly, and taken care to avoid seeing me again. This however was not Elstir’s way with me; like the master that he was — and this was, perhaps, from the point of view of sheer creative genius, his one fault, that he was a master in that sense of the word, for an artist if he is to live the true life of the spirit in its full extent, must be alone and not bestow himself with profusion, even upon disciples — from every circumstance, whether involving himself or other people, he sought to extract, for the better edification of the young, the element of truth that it contained. He chose therefore, rather than say anything that might have avenged the injury to his pride, to say what he thought would prove instructive to me. “There is no man,” he began, “however wise, who has not at some period of his youth said things, or lived in a way the consciousness of which is so unpleasant to him in later life that he would gladly, if he could, expunge it from his memory. And yet he ought not entirely to regret it, because he cannot be certain that he has indeed become a wise man — so far as it is possible for any of us to be wise — unless he has passed through all the fatuous or unwholesome incarnations by which that ultimate stage must be preceded. I know that there are young fellows, the sons and grandsons of famous men, whose masters have instilled into them nobility of mind and moral refinement in their schooldays. They have, perhaps, when they look back upon their past lives, nothing to retract; they can, if they choose, publish a signed account of everything they have ever said or done; but they are poor creatures, feeble descendants of doctrinaires, and their wisdom is negative and sterile. We are not provided with wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can take for us, an effort which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. The lives that you admire, the attitudes that seem noble to you are not the result of training at home, by a father, or by masters at school, they have sprung from beginnings of a very different order, by reaction from the influence of everything evil or commonplace that prevailed round about them. They represent a struggle and a victory. I can see that the picture of what we once were, in early youth, may not be recognisable and cannot, certainly, be pleasing to contemplate in later life. But we must not deny the truth of it, for it is evidence that we have really lived, that it is in accordance with the laws of life and of the mind that we have, from the common elements of life, of the life of studios, of artistic groups — assuming that one is a painter — extracted something that goes beyond them.” Meanwhile we had reached his door. I was disappointed at not having met the girls. But after all there was now the possibility of meeting them again later on; they had ceased to do no more than pass beyond a horizon on which I had been ready to suppose that I should never see them reappear. Around them no longer swirled that sort of great eddy which had separated me from them, which had been merely the expression of the perpetually active desire, mobile, compelling, fed ever on fresh anxieties, which was aroused in me by their inaccessibility, their flight from me, possibly for ever. My desire for them, I could now set it at rest, hold it in reserve, among all those other desires the realisation of which, as soon as I knew it to be possible, I would cheerfully postpone. I took leave of Elstir; I was alone once again. Then all of a sudden, despite my recent disappointment, I saw in my mind’s eye all that chain of coincidence which I had not supposed could possibly come about, that Elstir should be a friend of those very girls, that they who only that morning had been to me merely figures in a picture with the sea for background had seen me, had seen me walking in friendly intimacy with a great painter, who was now informed of my secret longing and would no doubt do what he could to assuage it. All this had been a source of pleasure to me, but that pleasure had remained hidden; it was one of those visitors who wait before letting us know that they are in the room until all the rest have gone and we are by ourselves. Then only do we catch sight of them, and can say to them, “I am at your service,” and listen to what they have to tell us. Sometimes between the moment at which these pleasures have entered our consciousness and the moment at which we are free to entertain them, so many hours have passed, we have in the interval seen so many people that we are afraid lest they should have grown tired of waiting. But they are patient, they do not grow tired, and as soon as the crowd has gone we find them there ready for us. Sometimes it is then we who are so exhausted that it seems as though our weary mind will not have the strength left to seize and retain those memories, those impressions for which our frail self is the one habitable place, the sole means of realisation. And we should regret that failure, for existence to us is hardly interesting save on the days on which the dust of realities is shot with magic sand, on which some trivial incident of life becomes a spring of romance. Then a whole promontory of the inaccessible world rises clear in the light of our dream, and enters into our life, our life in which, like the sleeper awakened, we actually see the people of whom we have been so ardently dreaming that we came to believe that we should never behold them save in our dreams<br>
<br>
   The sense of comfort that I drew from the probability of my now being able to meet the little band whenever I chose was all the more precious to me because I should not have been able to keep watch for them during the next few days, which would be taken up with preparations for Saint-Loup’s departure. My grandmother was anxious to offer my friend some proof of her gratitude for all the kindnesses that he had shewn to her and myself. I told her that he was a great admirer of Proudhon, and this put it into her head to send for a collection of autograph letters by that philosopher which she had once bought; Saint-Loup came to her room to look at them on the day of their arrival, which was also his last day at Balbec. He read them eagerly, fingering each page with reverence, trying to get the sentences by heart; and then, rising from the table, was beginning to apologise to my grandmother for having stayed so long, when he heard her say: “No, no; take them with you; they are for you to keep; that was why I sent for them, to give them to you.”<br>
<br>
   He was overpowered by a joy which he could no more control than we can a physical condition that arises without the intervention of our will. He blushed scarlet as a child who has just been whipped, and my grandmother was a great deal more touched to see all the efforts that he was making (without success) to control the joy that convulsed him than she would have been to hear any words of thanks that he could have uttered. But he, fearing that he had failed to shew his gratitude properly, begged me to make his excuses to her again, next day, leaning from the window of the little train of the local railway company which was to take him back to his regiment. The distance was, as a matter of fact, nothing. He had thought of going, as he had frequently done that summer, when he was to return the same evening and was not encumbered with luggage, by road. But this time he would have had, anyhow, to put all his heavy luggage in the train. And he found it simpler to take the train himself also, following the advice of the manager who, on being consulted, replied that “Carriage or train, it was more or less equivocal.” He meant us to understand that they were equivalent (in fact, very much what Françoise would have expressed as “coming to as near as made no difference”). “Very well,” Saint-Loup had decided, “I will take the ‘little crawler.’” I should have taken it too, had I not been tired, and gone with my friend to Doncières; failing this I kept on promising, all the time that we waited in the Balbec station — the time, that is to say, which the driver of the little train spent in waiting for unpunctual friends, without whom he refused to start, and also in seeking some refreshment for himself — to go over there and see him several times a week. As Bloch had come to the station also — much to Saint-Loup’s disgust — the latter, seeing that our companion could hear him begging me to come to luncheon, to dinner, to stay altogether at Doncières, finally turned to him and, in the most forbidding tone, intended to counteract the forced civility of the invitation and to prevent Bloch from taking it seriously: “If you ever happen to be passing through Doncières any afternoon when I am off duty, you might ask for me at the barracks; but I hardly ever am off duty.” Perhaps, also, Robert feared lest, if left to myself, I might not come, and, thinking that I was more intimate with Bloch than I made out, was providing me in this way with a travelling companion, one who would urge me on<br>
<br>
   I was afraid that this tone, this way of inviting a person while warning him not to come, might have wounded Bloch, and felt that Saint-Loup would have done better, saying nothing. But I was mistaken, for after the train had gone, while we were walking back together as far as the crossroads at which we should have to part, one road going to the hotel, the other to the Blochs’ villa, he never ceased from asking me on what day we should go to Doncières, for after “all the civilities that Saint-Loup had shewn” him, it would be ‘too unmannerly’ on his part not to accept the invitation. I was glad that he had not noticed, or was so little displeased as to wish to let it be thought that he had not noticed on how far from pressing, how barely polite a note the invitation had been sounded. At the same time I should have liked Bloch, for his own sake, to refrain from making a fool of himself by going over at once to Doncières. But I dared not offer a piece of advice which could only have offended him by hinting that Saint-Loup had been less pressing than himself impressed. He was a great deal too ready to respond, and even if all his faults of this nature were atoned for by remarkable qualities which others, with more reserve than he, would not possess, he carried indiscretion to a pitch that was almost maddening. The week must not, to hear him speak, pass without our going to Doncières (he said ‘our’ for I think that he counted to some extent on my presence there as an excuse for his own). All the way home, opposite the gymnasium, in its grove of trees, opposite the lawn-tennis courts, the mayor’s office, the shell-fish stall, he stopped me, imploring me to fix a day, and, as I did not, left me in a towering rage, saying: “As your lordship pleases. For my part, I’m obliged to go since he has invited me.”<br>
<br>
   Saint-Loup was still so much afraid of not having thanked my grandmother properly that he charged me once again to express his gratitude to her a day or two later in a letter I received from him from the town in which he was quartered, a town which seemed, on the envelope where the post-mark had stamped its name, to be hastening to me across country, to tell me that within its walls, in the Louis XVI cavalry barracks, he was thinking of me. The paper was embossed with the arms of Marsantes, in which I could make out a lion, surmounted by a coronet formed by the cap of a Peer of France<br>
<br>
    “After a journey which,” he wrote, “passed pleasantly enough, with a book I bought at the station, by Arvède Barine (a Russian author, I fancy; it seemed to me remarkably well written for a foreigner, but you shall give me your critical opinion, you are bound to know all about it, you fount of knowledge who have read everything), here I am again in the thick of this debased existence, where, alas, I feel a sad exile, not having here what I had to leave at Balbec; this life in which I cannot discover one affectionate memory, any intellectual attraction; an environment on which you would probably look with contempt — and yet it has a certain charm. Everything seems to have changed since I was last here, for in the interval one of the most important periods in my life, that from which our friendship dates, has begun. I hope that it may never come to an end. I have spoken of our friendship, of you, to one person only, to the friend I told you of, who has just paid me a surprise visit here. She would like immensely to know you, and I feel that you would get on well together, for she too is extremely literary. I, on the other hand, to go over in my mind all our talk, to live over again those hours which I never shall forget, have shut myself off from my comrades, excellent fellows, but altogether incapable of understanding that sort of thing. This remembrance of moments spent with you I should almost have preferred, on my first day here, to call up for my own solitary enjoyment, without writing. But I was afraid lest you, with your subtle mind and ultra-sensitive heart, might, if you did not hear from me, needlessly torment yourself, if, that is to say, you still condescend to occupy your thoughts with this blunt trooper whom you will have a hard task to polish and refine, and make a little more subtle and worthier of your company.”<br>
<br>
   On the whole this letter, in its affectionate spirit, was not at all unlike those which, when I did not yet know Saint-Loup, I had imagined that he would write to me, in those daydreams from which the coldness of his first greeting had shaken me by bringing me face to face with an icy reality which was not, however, to endure. Once I had received this letter, whenever, at luncheon-time, the post was brought in, I could tell at once when it was from him that a letter came, for it had always that second face which a person assumes when he is absent, in the features of which (the characters of his script) there is no reason why we should not suppose that we are tracing an individual soul just as much as in the line of a nose or the inflexions of a voice<br>
<br>
   I would now gladly remain at the table while it was being cleared, and, if it was not a moment at which the girls of the little band might be passing, it was no longer solely towards the sea that I would turn my eyes. Since I had seen such things depicted in water-colours by Elstir, I sought to find again in reality, I cherished, as though for their poetic beauty, the broken gestures of the knives still lying across one another, the swollen convexity of a discarded napkin upon which the sun would patch a scrap of yellow velvet, the half-empty glass which thus shewed to greater advantage the noble sweep of its curved sides, and, in the heart of its translucent crystal, clear as frozen daylight, a dreg of wine, dusky but sparkling with reflected lights, the displacement of solid objects, the transmutation of liquids by the effect of light and shade, the shifting colour of the plums which passed from green to blue and from blue to golden yellow in the half-plundered dish, the chairs, like a group of old ladies, that came twice daily to take their places round the white cloth spread on the table as on an altar at which were celebrated the rites of the palate, where in the hollows of oyster-shells a few drops of lustral water had gathered as in tiny holy water stoups of stone; I tried to find beauty there where I had never imagined before that it could exist, in the most ordinary things, in the profundities of ‘still life.’<br>
<br>
   When, some days after Saint-Loup’s departure, I had succeeded in persuading Elstir to give a small tea-party, at which I was to meet Albertine, that freshness of appearance, that smartness of attire, both (alas) fleeting, which were to be observed in me at the moment of my starting out from the Grand Hotel, and were due respectively to a longer rest than usual and to special pains over my toilet, I regretted my inability to reserve them (and also the credit accruing from Elstir’s friendship) for the captivation of some other, more interesting person; I regretted having to use them all up on the simple pleasure of making Albertine’s acquaintance. My brain assessed this pleasure at a very low value now that it was assured me. But, inside, my will did not for a moment share this illusion, that will which is the persevering and unalterable servant of our successive personalities; hiding itself in secret places, despised, downtrodden, untiringly faithful, toiling without intermission and with no thought for the variability of the self, its master, if only that master may never lack what he requires. Whereas at the moment when we are just about to start on a long-planned and eagerly awaited holiday, our brain, our nerves begin to ask themselves whether it is really worth all the trouble involved, the will, knowing that those lazy masters would at once begin to consider their journey the most wonderful experience, if it became impossible for them to take it, the will leaves them explaining their difficulties outside the station, multiplying their hesitations; but busies itself with taking the tickets and putting us into the carriage before the train starts. It is as invariable as brain and nerves are fickle, but as it is silent, gives no account of its actions, it seems almost non-existent; it is by its dogged determination that the other constituent parts of our personality are led, but without seeing it, while they distinguish clearly all their own uncertainties. My nerves and brain then started a discussion as to the real value of the pleasure that there would be in knowing Albertine, while I studied in the glass vain and perishable attractions which nerves and brain would have preserved intact for use on some other occasion. But my will would not let the hour pass at which I must start, and ‘it was Elstir’s address that it called out to the driver. Brain and nerves were at liberty, now that the die was cast, to think this ‘a pity.’ If my will had given the man a different address, they would have been finely ‘sold.’<br>
<br>
   When I arrived at Elstir’s, a few minutes later, my first impression was that Mlle. Simonet was not in the studio. There was certainly a girl sitting there in a silk frock, bareheaded, but one whose marvellous hair, whose nose, meant nothing to me, in whom I did not recognise the human entity that I had formed out of a young cyclist strolling past, in a polo-cap, between myself and the sea. It was Albertine, nevertheless. But even when I knew it to be she, I gave her no thought. On entering any social gathering, when we are young, we lose consciousness of our old self, we become a different man, every drawing-room being a fresh universe, in which, coming under the sway of a new moral perspective, we fasten our attention, as if they were to matter to us for all time, on people, dances, card-tables, all of which we shall have forgotten by the morning. Obliged to follow, if I was to arrive at the goal of conversation with Albertine, a road in no way of my own planning, which first brought me to a halt at Elstir, passed by other groups of guests to whom I was presented, then along the table, at which I was offered, and ate, a strawberry tart or two, while I listened, motionless, to the music that was beginning in another part of the room, I found myself giving to these various incidents the same importance as to my introduction to Mlle. Simonet, an introduction which was now nothing more than one among several such incidents, having entirely forgotten that it had been, but a few minutes since, my sole object in coming there that day. But is it not ever thus in the bustle of daily life, with every true happiness, every great sorrow? In a room full of other people we receive from her whom we love the answer, propitious or fatal, which we have been awaiting for the last year. But we must go on talking, ideas come, one after another, forming a smooth surface which is pricked, at the very most, now and then by a dull throb from within of the memory, deep-rooted enough but of very slender growth, that misfortune has come upon us. If, instead of misfortune, it is happiness, it may be that not until many years have elapsed will we recall that the most important event in our sentimental life occurred without our having time to give it any prolonged attention, or even to become aware of it almost, at a social gathering, it may have been, to which we had gone solely in expectation of that event<br>
<br>
   When Elstir asked me to come with him so that he might introduce me to Albertine, who was sitting a little farther down the room, I first of all finished eating a coffee éclair and, with a show of keen interest, asked an old gentleman whose acquaintance I had just made (and thought that I might, perhaps, offer him the rose in my buttonhole which he had admired) to tell me more about the old Norman fairs. This is not to say that the introduction which followed did not give me any pleasure, nor assume a definite importance in my eyes. But so far as the pleasure was concerned, I was not conscious of it, naturally, until some time later, when, once more in the hotel, and in my room alone, I had become myself again. Pleasure in this respect is like photography. What we take, in the presence of the beloved object, is merely a negative film; we develop it later, when we are at home, and have once again found at our disposal that inner darkroom, the entrance to which is barred to us so long as we are with other people<br>
<br>
   If my consciousness of the pleasure it had brought me was thus retarded by a few hours, the importance of this introduction I felt immediately. At such moments of introduction, for all that we feel ourselves to have been suddenly enriched, to have been furnished with a pass that will admit us henceforward to pleasures which we have been pursuing for weeks past, but in vain, we realise only too clearly that this acquisition puts an end for us not merely to hours of toilsome search — a relief that could only fill us with joy — but also to the very existence of a certain person, her whom our imagination had wildly distorted, our anxious fear that we might never become known to her enlarged. At the moment when our name sounds on the lips of the person introducing us, especially if he amplifies it, as Elstir was now doing, with a flattering account of us — in that sacramental moment, as when in a fairy tale the magician commands a person suddenly to become someone else, she to whose presence we have been longing to attain vanishes; how could she remain the same when, for one thing — owing to the attention which the stranger is obliged to pay to the announcement of our name and the sight of our person — in the eyes that only yesterday were situated at an infinite distance (where we supposed that our eyes, wandering, uncontrolled, desperate, divergent, would never succeed in meeting them) the conscious gaze, the incommunicable thought which we have been seeking have been miraculously and quite simply replaced by our own image, painted in them as though behind the glass of a smiling mirror. If this incarnation of ourself in the person who seems to differ most from us is what does most to modify the appearance of the person to whom we have just been introduced, the form of that person still remains quite vague; and we are free to ask ourself whether she will turn out to be a god, a table or a basin. But, as nimble as the wax-modellers who will fashion a bust before our eyes in five minutes, the few words which the stranger is now going to say to us will substantiate her form, will give her something positive and final that will exclude all the hypotheses by which, a moment ago, our desire, our imagination were being tempted. Doubtless, even before her coming to this party, Albertine had ceased to be to me simply that sole phantom worthy to haunt our life which is what remains of a passing stranger, of whom we know nothing and have caught but the barest glimpse. Her relation to Mme. Bontemps had already restricted the scope of those marvellous hypotheses, by stopping one of the channels along which they might have spread. As I drew closer to the girl, and began to know her better, my knowledge of her underwent a process of subtraction, all the factors of imagination and desire giving place to a notion which was worth infinitely less, a notion to which, it must be admitted, there was added presently what was more or less the equivalent, in the domain of real life, of what joint stock companies give one, after paying interest on one’s capital, and call a bonus. Her name, her family connexions had been the original limit set to my suppositions. Her friendly greeting while, standing close beside her, I saw once again the tiny mole on her cheek, below her eye, marked another stage; last of all, I was surprised to hear her use the adverb ‘perfectly’ (in place of ‘quite’) of two people whom she mentioned, saying of one: “She is perfectly mad, but very nice for all that,” and of the other, “He is a perfectly common man, a perfect bore.” However little to be commended this use of ‘perfectly’ may be, it indicates a degree of civilisation and culture which I could never have imagined as having been attained by the bacchante with the bicycle, the frenzied muse of the golf-course. Nor did it mean that after this first transformation Albertine was not to change again for me, many times. The good and bad qualities which a person presents to us, exposed to view on the surface of his or her face, rearrange themselves in a totally different order if we approach them from another angle — just as, in a town, buildings that appear strung irregularly along a single line, from another aspect retire into a graduated distance, and their relative heights are altered. To begin with, Albertine now struck me as not implacable so much as almost frightened; she seemed to me rather respectably than ill bred, judging by the description, ‘bad style,’ ‘a comic manner’ which she applied to each in turn of the girls of whom I spoke to her; finally, she presented as a target for my line of sight a temple that was distinctly flushed and hardly attractive to the eye, and no longer the curious gaze which I had always connected with her until then. But this was merely a second impression and there were doubtless others through which I was successively to pass. Thus it can be only after one has recognised, not without having had to feel one’s way, the optical illusions of one’s first impression that one can arrive at an exact knowledge of another person, supposing such knowledge to be ever possible. But it is not; for while our original impression of him undergoes correction, the person himself, not being an inanimate object, changes in himself, we think that we have caught him, he moves, and, when we imagine that at last we are seeing him clearly, it is only the old impressions which we had already formed of him that we have succeeded in making clearer, when they no longer represent him<br>
<br>
   And yet, whatever the inevitable disappointments that it must bring in its train, this movement towards what we have only half seen, what we have been free to dwell upon and imagine at our leisure, this movement is the only one that is wholesome for the senses, that whets the appetite. How dreary a monotony must pervade those people’s lives who, from indolence or timidity, drive in their carriages straight to the doors of friends whom they have got to know without having first dreamed of knowing them, without ever daring, on the way, to stop and examine what arouses their desire<br>
<br>
   I returned home, my mind full of the party, the coffee éclair which I had finished eating before I let Elstir take me up to Albertine, the rose which I had given the old gentleman, all the details selected without our knowledge by the circumstances of the occasion, which compose in a special and quite fortuitous order the picture that we retain of a first meeting. But this picture, I had the impression that I was seeing it from a fresh point of view, a long way remote from myself, realising that it had not existed only for me, when some months later, to my great surprise, on my speaking to Albertine on the day on which I had first met her, she reminded me of the éclair, the flower that I had given away, all those things which I had supposed to have been — I will not say of importance only to myself but — perceived only by myself, and which I now found thus transcribed, in a version the existence of which I had never suspected, in the mind of Albertine. On this first day itself, when, on my return to the hotel, I was able to visualise the memory which I had brought away with me, I realised the consummate adroitness with which the sleight of hand had been performed, and how I had talked for a moment or two with a person who, thanks to the skill of the conjurer, without actually embodying anything of that other person whom I had for so long been following as she paced beside the sea, had been effectively substituted for her. I might, for that matter, have guessed as much in advance, since the girl of the beach was a fabrication invented by myself. In spite of which, as I had, in my conversations with Elstir, identified her with this other girl, I felt myself in honour bound to fulfil to the real the promises of love made to the imagined Albertine. We betroth ourselves by proxy, and think ourselves obliged, in the sequel, to marry the person who has intervened. Moreover, if there had disappeared, provisionally at any rate, from my life, an anguish that found adequate consolation in the memory of polite manners, of that expression ‘perfectly common’ and of the glowing temple, that memory awakened in me desire of another kind which, for all that it was placid and not at all painful, resembling rather brotherly love, might in the long run become fully as dangerous by making me feel at every moment a compelling need to kiss this new person, whose charming ways, shyness, unlooked-for accessibility, arrested the futile process of my imagination but gave birth to a sentimental gratitude. And then, since memory begins at once to record photographs independent of one another, eliminates every link, any kind of sequence from between the scenes portrayed in the collection which it exposes to our view, the most recent does not necessarily destroy or cancel those that came before. Confronted with the commonplace though appealing Albertine to whom I had spoken that afternoon, I still saw the other, mysterious Albertine outlined against the sea. These were now memories, that is to say pictures neither of which now seemed to me any more true than the other. But, to make an end of this first afternoon of my introduction to Albertine, when trying to recapture that little mole on her cheek, just under the eye, I remembered that, looking from Elstir’s window, when Albertine had gone by, I had seen the mole on her chin. In fact, whenever I saw her I noticed that she had a mole, but my inaccurate memory made it wander about the face of Albertine, fixing it now in one place, now in another<br>
<br>
   Whatever my disappointment in finding in Mlle. Simonet a girl so little different from those that I knew already, just as my rude awakening when I saw Balbec Church did not prevent me from wishing still to go to Quimperlé, Pont-Aven and Venice, I comforted myself with the thought that through Albertine at any rate, even if she herself was not all that I had hoped, I might make the acquaintance of her comrades of the little band<br>
<br>
   I thought at first that I should fail. As she was to be staying (and I too) for a long time still at Balbec, I had decided that the best thing was not to make my efforts to meet her too apparent, but to wait for an accidental encounter. But should this occur every day, even, it was greatly to be feared that she would confine herself to acknowledging my bow from a distance, and such meetings, repeated day after day throughout the whole season, would benefit me not at all<br>
<br>
   Shortly after this, one morning when it had been raining and was almost cold, I was accosted on the ‘front’ by a girl wearing a close-fitting toque and carrying a muff, so different from the girl whom I had met at Elstir’s party that to recognise in her the same person seemed an operation beyond the power of the human mind; mine was, nevertheless, successful in performing it, but after a momentary surprise which did not, I think, escape Albertine’s notice. On the other hand, when I instinctively recalled the good breeding which had so impressed me before, she filled me with a converse astonishment by her rude tone and manners typical of the ‘little band.’ Apart from these, her temple had ceased to be the optical centre, on which the eye might comfortably rest, of her face, either because I was now on her other side, or because her toque hid it, or else possibly because its inflammation was not a constant thing. “What weather!” she began. “Really the perpetual summer of Balbec is all stuff and nonsense. You don’t go in for anything special here, do you? We don’t ever see you playing golf, or dancing at the Casino. You don’t ride, either. You must be bored stiff. You don’t find it too deadly, staying about on the beach all day? I see, you just bask in the sun like a lizard; you enjoy that. You must have plenty of time on your hands. I can see you’re not like me; I simply adore all sports. You weren’t at the Sogne races! We went in the ‘tram,’ and I can quite believe you don’t see the fun of going in an old ‘tin-pot’ like that. It took us two whole hours! I could have gone there and back three times on my bike.” I, who had been lost in admiration of Saint-Loup when he, in the most natural manner in the world, called the little local train the ‘crawler,’ because of the ceaseless windings of its line, was positively alarmed by the glibness with which Albertine spoke of the ‘tram,’ and called it a ‘tin-pot.’ I could feel her mastery of a form of speech in which I was afraid of her detecting and scorning my inferiority. And yet the full wealth of the synonyms that the little band possessed to denote this railway had not yet been revealed to me. In speaking, Albertine kept her head motionless, her nostrils closed, allowing only the corners of her lips to move. The result of this was a drawling, nasal sound, into the composition of which there entered perhaps a provincial descent, a juvenile affectation of British phlegm, the teaching of a foreign governess and a congestive hypertrophy of the mucus of the nose. This enunciation which, as it happened, soon disappeared when she knew people better, giving place to a natural girlish tone, might have been thought unpleasant. But it was peculiar to herself, and delighted me. Whenever I had gone for several days without seeing her, I would refresh my spirit by repeating to myself: “We don’t ever see you playing golf,” with the nasal intonation in which she had uttered the words, point blank, without moving a muscle of her face. And I thought then that there could be no one in the world so desirable<br>
<br>
   We formed that morning one of those couples who dotted the ‘front’ here and there with their conjunction, their stopping together for time enough just to exchange a few words before breaking apart, each to resume separately his or her divergent stroll. I seized the opportunity, while she stood still, to look again and discover once and for all where exactly the little mole was placed. Then, just as a phrase of Vinteuil which had delighted me in the sonata, and which my recollection allowed to wander from the andante to the finale, until the day when, having the score in my hands, I was able to find it, and to fix it in my memory in its proper place, in the scherzo, so this mole, which I had visualised now on her cheek, now on her chin, came to rest for ever on her upper lip, just below her nose. In the same way, too, do we come with amazement upon lines that we know by heart in a poem in which we never dreamed that they were to be found<br>
<br>
   At that moment, as if in order that against the sea there might multiply in freedom, in the variety of its forms, all the rich decorative whole which was the lovely unfolding of the train of maidens, at once golden and rosy, baked by sun and wind, Albertine’s friends, with their shapely limbs, their supple figures, but so different one from another, came into sight in a cluster that expanded as it approached, advancing towards us, but keeping closer to the sea, along a parallel line. I asked Albertine’s permission to walk for a little way with her. Unfortunately, all she did was to wave her hand to them in greeting. “But your friends will be disappointed if you don’t go with them,” I hinted, hoping that we might all walk together. A young man with regular features, carrying a bag of golf-clubs, sauntered up to us. It was the baccarat-player, whose fast ways so enraged the chief magistrate’s wife. In a frigid, impassive tone, which he evidently regarded as an indication of the highest refinement, he bade Albertine good day. “Been playing golf, Octave?” she asked. “How did the game go? Were you in form?” “Oh, it’s too sickening; I can’t play for nuts,” he replied. “Was Andrée playing?” “Yes, she went round in seventy-seven.” “Why, that’s a record!” “I went round in eighty-two yesterday.” He was the son of an immensely rich manufacturer who was to take an important part in the organisation of the coming World’s Fair. I was struck by the extreme degree to which, in this young man and in the other by no means numerous male friends of the band of girls, the knowledge of everything that pertained to clothes and how to wear them, cigars, English drinks, horses, a knowledge which he possessed in its minutest details with a haughty infallibility that approached the reticent modesty of the true expert, had been developed in complete isolation, unaccompanied by the least trace of any intellectual culture. He had no hesitation as to the right time and place for dinner-jacket or pyjamas, but neither had he any suspicion of the circumstances in which one might or might not employ this or that word, or even of the simplest rules of grammar. This disparity between the two forms of culture must have existed also in his father, the President of the Syndicate that ‘ran’ Balbec, for, in an open letter to the electors which he had recently had posted on all the walls, he announced: “I desired to see the Mayor, to speak to him of the matter; he would not listen to my righteous plaint.” Octave, at the Casino, took prizes in all the dancing competitions, for bostons, tangos and what-not, an accomplishment that would entitle him, if he chose, to make a fine marriage in that seaside society where it is not figuratively but in sober earnest that the young women ‘marry their dancing-partners.’ He lighted a cigar with a “D’you mind?” to Albertine, as one who asks permission to finish, while going on talking, an urgent piece of work. For he was one of those people who can never be ‘doing nothing,’ although there was nothing, for that matter, that he could ever be said to do. And as complete inactivity has the same effect on us, in the end, as prolonged overwork, and on the character as much as on the life of body and muscles, the unimpaired nullity of intellect that was enshrined behind Octave’s meditative brow had ended by giving him, despite his air of unruffled calm, ineffectual longings to think which kept him awake at night, for all the world like an overwrought philosopher<br>
<br>
   Supposing that if I knew their male friends I should have more opportunities of seeing the girls, I had been on the point of asking for an introduction to Octave. I told Albertine this, as soon as he had left us, still muttering, “I couldn’t play for nuts!” I thought I would thus put into her head the idea of doing it next time. “But I can’t,” she cried, “introduce you to a tame cat like that. This place simply swarms with them. But what on earth would they have to say to you? That one plays golf quite well, and that’s all there is to it. I know what I’m talking about; you’d find he wasn’t at all your sort.” “Your friends will be cross with you if you desert them like this,” I repeated, hoping that she would then suggest my joining the party. “Oh, no, they don’t want me.” We ran into Bloch, who directed at me a subtle, insinuating smile, and, embarrassed by the presence of Albertine, whom he did not know, or, rather, knew ‘without knowing’ her, bent his head with a stiff, almost irritated jerk. “What’s he called, that Ostrogoth?” Albertine asked. “I can’t think why he should bow to me; he doesn’t know me. And I didn’t bow to him, either.” I had no time to explain to her, for, bearing straight down upon us, “Excuse me,” he began, “for interrupting you, but I must tell you that I am going to Don-cières to-morrow. I cannot put it off any longer without discourtesy; indeed, I ask myself, what must de Saint-Loup-en-Bray think of me. I just came to let you know that I shall take the two o’clock train. At your service.” But I thought now only of seeing Albertine again, and of trying to get to know her friends, and Doncières, since they were not going there, and my going would bring me back too late to see them still on the beach, seemed to me to be situated at the other end of the world. I told Bloch that it was impossible. “Oh, very well, I shall go alone. In the fatuous words of Master Arouet, I shall say to Saint-Loup, to beguile his clericalism:<br>
<br>
            ‘My duty stands alone, by his in no way bound;<br>
               Though he should choose to fail, yet faithful I’ll be found.’”<br>
<br>
    “I admit he’s not a bad looking boy,” was Albertine’s comment, “but he makes me feel quite sick.” I had never thought that Bloch might be ‘not a bad looking boy’; and yet, when one came to think of it, so he was. With his rather prominent brow, very aquiline nose, and his air of extreme cleverness and of being convinced of his cleverness, he had a pleasing face. But he could not succeed in pleasing Albertine. This was perhaps due, to some extent, to her own disadvantages, the harshness, the want of feeling of the little band, its rudeness towards everything that was not itself. And later on, when I introduced them, Albertine’s antipathy for him grew no less. Bloch belonged to a section of society in which, between the free and easy customs of the ‘smart set’ and the regard for good manners which a man is supposed to shew who ‘does not soil his hands,’ a sort of special compromise has been reached which differs from the manners of the world and is nevertheless a peculiarly unpleasant form of worldliness. When he was introduced to anyone he would bow with a sceptical smile, and at the same time with an exaggerated show of respect, and, if it was to a man, would say: “Pleased to meet you, sir,” in a voice which ridiculed the words that it was uttering, though with a consciousness of belonging to some one who was no fool. Having sacrificed this first moment to a custom which he at once followed and derided (just as on the first of January he would greet you with a ‘Many happy!’) he would adopt an air of infinite cunning, and would ‘proffer subtle words’ which were often true enough but ‘got on’ Albertine’s nerves. When I told her on this first day that his name was Bloch, she exclaimed: “I would have betted anything he was a Jew-boy. Trust them to put their foot in it!” Moreover, Bloch was destined to give Albertine other grounds for annoyance later on. Like many intellectuals, he was incapable of saying a simple thing in a simple way. He would find some precious qualification for every statement, and would sweep from particular to general. It vexed Albertine, who was never too well pleased at other people’s shewing an interest in what she was doing, that when she had sprained her ankle and was keeping quiet, Bloch said of her: “She is outstretched on her chair, but in her ubiquity has not ceased to frequent simultaneously vague golf-courses and dubious tennis-courts.” He was simply being ‘literary,’ of course, but this, in view of the difficulties which Albertine felt that it might create for her with friends whose invitations she had declined on the plea that she was unable to move, was quite enough to disgust her with the face, the sound of the voice, of the young man who could say such things about her. We parted, Albertine and I, after promising to take a walk together later. I had talked to her without being any more conscious of where my words were falling, of what became of them, than if I were dropping pebbles into a bottomless pit. That our words are, as a general rule, filled, by the person to whom we address them, with a meaning which that person derives from her own substance, a meaning widely different from that which we had put into the same words when we uttered them, is a fact which the daily round of life is perpetually demonstrating. But if we find ourselves as well in the company of a person whose education (as Albertine’s was to me) is inconceivable, her tastes, her reading, her principles unknown, we cannot tell whether our words have aroused in her anything that resembles their meaning, any more than in an animal, although there are things that even an animal may be made to understand. So that to attempt any closer friendship with Albertine seemed to me like placing myself in contact with the unknown, if not the impossible, an occupation as arduous as breaking a horse, as reposeful as keeping bees or growing roses<br>
<br>
    I had thought, a few hours before, that Albertine would acknowledge my bow but would not speak to me. We had now parted, after planning to make some excursion soon together. I vowed that when I next met Albertine I would treat her with greater boldness, and I had sketched out in advance a draft of all that I would say to her, and even (being now quite convinced that she was not strait-laced) of all the favours that I would demand of her. But the mind is subject to external influences, as plants are, and cells and chemical elements, and the medium in which its immersion alters it is a change of circumstances, or new surroundings. Grown different by the mere fact of her presence, when I found myself once again in Albertine’s company, what I said to her was not at all what I had meant to say. Remembering her flushed temple, I asked myself whether she might not appreciate more keenly a polite attention which she knew to be disinterested. Besides, I was embarrassed by certain things in her look, in her smile. They might equally well signify a laxity of morals and the rather silly merriment of a girl who though full of spirits was at heart thoroughly respectable. A single expression, on a face as in speech, is susceptible of divers interpretations, and I stood hesitating like a schoolboy faced by the difficulties of a piece of Greek prose<br>
<br>
    On this occasion we met almost immediately the tall one, Andrée, the one who had jumped over the old banker, and Albertine was obliged to introduce me. Her friend had a pair of eyes of extraordinary brightness, like, in a dark house, a glimpse through an open door of a room into which the sun is shining with a greenish reflexion from the glittering sea<br>
<br>
    A party of five were passing, men whom I had come to know very well by sight during my stay at Balbec. I had often wondered who they could be. “They’re nothing very wonderful,” said Albertine with a sneering laugh. “The little old one with dyed hair and yellow gloves has a fine touch; he knows how to draw all right, he’s the Balbec dentist; he’s a good sort. The fat one is the Mayor, not the tiny little fat one, you must have seen him before, he’s the dancing master; he’s rather a beast, you know; he can’t stand us, because we make such a row at the Casino; we smash his chairs, and want to have the carpet up when we dance; that’s why he never gives us prizes, though we’re the only girls there who can dance a bit. The dentist is a dear, I would have said how d’ye do to him, just to make the dancing master swear, but I couldn’t because they’ve got M. de Sainte-Croix with them; he’s on the General Council; he comes of a very good family, but he’s joined the Republicans, to make more money. No nice people ever speak to him now. He knows my uncle, because they’re both in the Government, but the rest of my family always cut him. The thin one in the waterproof is the bandmaster. You know him, of course. You don’t? Oh, he plays divinely. You haven’t been to Cavalleria Rusticana? I thought it too lovely! He’s giving a concert this evening, but we can’t go because it’s to be in the town hall. In the Casino it wouldn’t matter, but in the town hall, where they’ve taken down the crucifix. Andrée’s mother would have a fit if we went there. You’re going to say that my aunt’s husband is in the Government. But what difference does that make? My aunt is my aunt. That’s not why I’m fond of her. The only thing she has ever wanted has been to get rid of me. No, the person who has really been a mother to me, and all the more credit to her because she’s no relation at all, is a friend of mine whom I love just as much as if she was my mother. I will let you see her ‘photo.’” We were joined for a moment by the golf champion and baccarat plunger, Octave. I thought that I had discovered a bond between us, for I learned in the course of conversation that he was some sort of relative, and even more a friend of the Verdurins. But he spoke contemptuously of the famous Wednesdays, adding that M. Verdurin had never even heard of a dinner-jacket, which made it a horrid bore when one ran into him in a music-hall, where one would very much rather not be greeted with “Well, you young rascal,” by an old fellow in a frock coat and black tie, for all the world like a village lawyer. Octave left us, and soon it was Andrée’s turn, when we came to her villa, into which she vanished without having uttered a single word to me during the whole of our walk. I regretted her departure, all the more in that, while I was complaining to Albertine how chilling her friend had been with me, and was comparing in my mind this difficulty which Albertine seemed to find in making me know her friends with the hostility that Elstir, when he might have granted my desire, seemed to have encountered on that first afternoon, two girls came by to whom I lifted my hat, the young Ambresacs, whom Albertine greeted also<br>
<br>
    I felt that, in Albertine’s eyes, my position would be improved by this meeting. They were the daughters of a kinswoman of Mme. de Ville-parisis, who was also a friend of Mme. de Luxembourg. M. and Mme. d’Ambresac, who had a small villa at Balbec and were immensely rich, led the simplest of lives there, and always went about dressed he in an unvarying frock coat, she in a dark gown. Both of them used to make sweeping bows to my grandmother, which never led to anything further. The daughters, who were very pretty, were dressed more fashionably, but in a fashion suited rather to Paris than to the seaside. With their long skirts and large hats, they had the look of belonging to a different race from Albertine. She, I discovered, knew all about them<br>
<br>
    “Oh, so you know the little d’Ambresacs, do you? Dear me, you have some swagger friends. After all, they’re very simple souls,” she went on as though this might account for it. “They’re very nice, but so well brought up that they aren’t allowed near the Casino, for fear of us — we’ve such a bad tone. They attract you, do they? Well, it all depends on what you like. They’re just little white rabbits, really. There may be something in that, of course. If little white rabbits are what appeals to you, they may supply a long-felt want. It seems, there must be some attraction, because one of them has got engaged already to the Marquis de Saint-Loup. Which is a cruel blow to the younger one, who is madly in love with that young man. I’m sure, the way they speak to you with their lips shut is quite enough for me. And then they dress in the most absurd way. Fancy going to play golf in silk frocks! At their age, they dress more showily than grown-up women who really know about clothes. Look at Mme. Elstir; there’s a well dressed woman if you like.” I answered that she had struck me as being dressed with the utmost simplicity. Albertine laughed. “She does put on the simplest things, I admit, but she dresses wonderfully, and to get what you call simplicity costs her a fortune.” Mme. Elstir’s gowns passed unnoticed by any one who had not a sober and unerring taste in matters of attire. This was lacking in me. Elstir possessed it in a supreme degree, or so Albertine told me. I had not suspected this, nor that the beautiful but quite simple objects which littered his studio were treasures long desired by him which he had followed from sale room to sale room, knowing all their history, until he had made enough money to be able to acquire them. But as to this Albertine, being as ignorant as myself, could not enlighten me. Whereas when it came to clothes, prompted by a coquettish instinct, and perhaps by the regretful longing of a penniless girl who is able to appreciate with greater disinterestedness, more delicacy of feeling, in other, richer people the things that she will never be able to afford for herself, she expressed herself admirably on the refinement of Elstir’s taste, so hard to satisfy that all women appeared to him badly dressed, while, attaching infinite importance to right proportions and shades of colour, he would order to be made for his wife, at fabulous prices, the sunshades, hats and cloaks which he had learned from Albertine to regard as charming, and which a person wanting in taste would no more have noticed than myself. Apart from this, Albertine, who had done a little painting, though without, she confessed, having any ‘gift’ for it, felt a boundless admiration for Elstir, and, thanks to his precept and example, shewed a judgment of pictures which was in marked contrast to her enthusiasm for Cavalleria Rusticana. The truth was, though as yet it was hardly apparent, that she was highly intelligent, and that in the things that she said the stupidity was not her own but that of her environment and age. Elstir’s had been a good but only a partial influence. All the branches of her intelligence had not reached the same stage of development. The taste for pictures had almost caught up the taste for clothes and all forms of smartness, but had not been followed by the taste for music, which was still a long way behind<br>
<br>
    Albertine might know all about the Ambresacs; but as he who can achieve great things is not necessarily capable of small, I did not find her, after I had bowed to those young ladies, any better disposed to make me known to her friends. “It’s too good of you to attach any importance to them. You shouldn’t take any notice of them; they don’t count. What on earth can a lot of kids like them mean to a man like you? Now Andrée, I must say, is remarkably clever. She is a good girl, that, though she is perfectly fantastic at times, but the others are really dreadfully stupid.” When I had left Albertine, I felt suddenly a keen regret that Saint-Loup should have concealed his engagement from me and that he should be doing anything so improper as to choose a wife before breaking with his mistress. And then, shortly afterwards, I met Andrée, and as she went on talking to me for some time I seized the opportunity to tell her that I would very much like to see her again next day, but she replied that this was impossible, because her mother was not at all well, and she would have to stay beside her. The next day but one, when I was at Elstir’s, he told me how greatly Andrée had been attracted by me; on my protesting: “But it was I who was attracted by her from the start; I asked her to meet me again yesterday, but she could not.” “Yes, I know; she told me all about that,” was his reply, “she was very sorry, but she had promised to go to a picnic, somewhere miles from here. They were to drive over in a break, and it was too late for her to get out of it.” Albeit this falsehood (Andrée knowing me so slightly) was of no real importance, I ought not to have continued to seek the company of a person who was capable of uttering it. For what people have once done they will do again indefinitely, and if you go every year to see a friend who, the first time, was not able to meet you at the appointed place, or was in bed with a chill, you will find him in bed with another chill which he has just caught, you will miss him again at another meeting-place at which he has failed to appear, for a single and unalterable reason in place of which he supposes himself to have various reasons, drawn from the circumstances. One morning, not long after An-dree’s telling me that she would be obliged to stay beside her mother, I was taking a short stroll with Albertine, whom I had found on the beach tossing up and catching again on a cord an oddly shaped implement which gave her a look of Giotto’s ‘Idolatry’; it was called, for that matter, ‘Diabolo,’ and is so fallen into disuse now that, when they come upon the picture of a girl playing with one, the critics of future generations will solemnly discuss, as it might be over one of the allegorical figures in the Arena, what it is that she is holding. A moment later their friend with the penurious and harsh appearance, the same one who on that first day had sneered so malevolently: “I do feel sorry for him, poor old man,” when, she saw the old gentleman’s head brushed by the flying feet of Andrée, came up to Albertine with “Good morning,‘m I disturbing you?” She had taken off her hat, for comfort, and her hair, like a strange and fascinating-plant, lay over her brow, displaying all the delicate tracery of its foliation^ Albertine, perhaps because she resented seeing the other bare-headed, made-no reply, preserved a frigid silence in spite of which the girl stayed with us, kept apart from myself by Albertine, who arranged at one moment to be-alone with her, at another to walk with me leaving her to follow. I was obliged, to secure an introduction, to ask for it in the girl’s hearing. Then, as Albertine was uttering my name, on the face and in the blue eyes of this girl, whose expression I had thought so cruel when I heard her say: “Poor old man, I do feel so sorry for him,” I saw gather and gleam a cordial, friendly smile, and she held out her hand. Her hair was golden, and not her hair only; for if her cheeks were pink and her eyes blue it was like the still roseate morning sky which sparkles everywhere with dazzling points of gold<br>
<br>
    At once kindled by her flame, I said to myself that this was a child who when in love grew shy, that it was for my sake, from love for me that she had remained with us, despite Albertine’s rebuffs, and that she must have rejoiced in the opportunity to confess to me at last, by that smiling, friendly gaze, that she would be as kind to me as she was terrible to other people. Doubtless she had noticed me on the beach, when I still knew nothing of her, and had been thinking of me ever since; perhaps it had been to win my admiration that she mocked at the old gentleman, and because she had not succeeded in getting to know me that on the following days she appeared so morose. From the hotel I had often seen her, in the evenings, walking by herself on the beach. Probably in the hope of meeting me. And now, hindered as much by Albertine’s presence as she would have been by that of the whole band, she had evidently attached herself to us, braving the increasing coldness of her friend’s attitude, only in the hope of outstaying her, of being left alone with me, when she might make an appointment with me for some time when she would find an excuse to slip away without either her family’s or her friends’ knowing that she had gone, and would meet me in some safe place before church or after golf. It was all the more difficult to see her because Andrée had quarrelled with her and now detested her. “I have put up far too long with her terrible dishonesty,” she explained to me, “her baseness; I can’t tell you all the vile insults she has heaped on me. I have stood it all because of the others. But her latest effort was really too much!” And she told me of some foolish thing that this girl had done, which might indeed have injurious consequences to Andrée herself<br>
<br>
    But those private words promised me by Gisèle’s confiding eyes for the moment when Albertine should have left us by ourselves, were destined never to be spoken, because after Albertine, stubbornly planted between us, had answered with increasing curtness, and finally had ceased to respond at all to her friend’s remarks, Gisèle at length abandoned the attempt and turned back. I found fault with Albertine for having been so disagreeable. “It will teach her to be more careful how she behaves. She’s not a bad kid, but she’d talk the head off a donkey. She’s no business, either, to go poking her nose into everything. Why should she fasten herself on to us without being asked? In another minute, I’d have told her to go to blazes. Besides I can’t stand her going about with her hair like that; it’s such bad form.” I gazed at Albertine’s cheeks as she spoke, and asked myself what might be the perfume, the taste of them: this time they were not cool, but glowed with a uniform pink, violet-tinted, creamy, like certain roses whose petals have a waxy gloss. I felt a passionate longing for them such as one feels sometimes for a particular flower. “I hadn’t noticed it,” was all that I said. “You stared at her hard enough; anyone would have said you wanted to paint her portrait,” she scolded, not at all softened by the fact that it was at herself that I was now staring so fixedly. “I don’t believe you would care for her, all the same. She’s not in the least a flirt. You like little girls who flirt with you, I know. Anyhow, she won’t have another chance of fastening on to us and being sent about her business; she’s going off to-day to Paris.” “Are the rest of your friends going too?” “No; only she and ‘Miss,’ because she’s got an exam, coming; she’s got to stay at home and swot for it, poor kid. It’s not much fun for her, I don’t mind telling you. Of course, you may be set a good subject, you never know. But it’s a tremendous risk. One girl I know was asked: <i>Describe an accident that you have witnessed</i>. That was a piece of luck. But I know another girl who got: <i>State which you would rather have as a friend, Alceste or Philinte</i>. I’m sure I should have dried up altogether! Apart from everything else, it’s not a question to set to girls. Girls go about with other girls; they’re not supposed to have gentlemen friends.” (This announcement, which shewed that I had but little chance of being admitted to the companionship of the band, froze my blood.) “But in any case, supposing it was set to boys, what on earth would you expect them to say to a question like that? Several parents wrote to the <i>Gaulois</i>, to complain of the difficult questions that were being set. The joke of it is that in a collection of prize-winning essays they gave two which treated the question in absolutely opposite ways. You see, it all depends on which examiner you get. One would like you to say that Philinte was a flatterer and a scoundrel, the other that you couldn’t help admiring Alceste, but that he was too cantankerous, and that as a friend you ought to choose Philinte. How can you expect a lot of unfortunate candidates to know what to say when the professors themselves can’t make up their minds. But that’s nothing. They get more difficult every year. Gisèle will want all her wits about her if she’s to get through.” I returned to the hotel. My grandmother was not there. I waited for her for some time; when at last she appeared, I begged her to allow me, in quite unexpected circumstances, to make an expedition which might keep me away for a couple of days. I had luncheon with her, ordered a carriage and drove to the station. Gisèle would shew no surprise at seeing me there. After we had changed at Doncières, in the. Paris train, there would be a carriage with a corridor, along which, while the governess dozed, I should be able to lead Gisèle into dark corners, and make an appointment to meet her on my return to Paris, which I would then try to put forward to the earliest possible date. I would travel with her as far as Caen or Evreux, whichever she preferred, and would take the next train back to Balbec. And yet, what would she have thought of me had she known that I had hesitated for a long time between her and her friends, that quite as much as with her I had contemplated falling in love with Albertine, with the bright-eyed girl, with Rosemonde. I felt a pang of remorse now that a bond of mutual affection was going to unite me with Gisèle. I could, moreover, truthfully have assured her that Albertine no longer interested me. I had seen her that morning as she swerved aside, almost turning her back on me, to speak to Gisèle. On her head, which was bent sullenly over her bosom, the hair that grew at the back, different from and darker even than the rest, shone as though she had just been bathing. “Like a dying duck in a thunderstorm!” I thought to myself, this view of her hair having let into Albertine’s body a soul entirely different from that implied hitherto by her glowing complexion and mysterious gaze. That shining cataract of hair at the back of her head had been for a moment or two all that I was able to see of her, and continued to be all that I saw in retrospect. Our memory is like a shop in the window of which is exposed now one, now another photograph of the same person. And as a rule the most recent exhibit remains for some time the only one to be seen. While the coachman whipped on his horse I sat there listening to the words of gratitude and affection which Gisèle was murmuring in my ear, born, all of them, of her friendly smile and outstretched hand, the fact being that in those periods of my life in which I was not actually, but desired to be in love, I carried in my mind not only an ideal form of beauty once seen, which I recognised at a glance in every passing stranger who kept far enough from me for her confused features to resist any attempt at identification, but also the moral phantom — ever ready to be incarnate — of the woman who was ‘going to fall in love with me, to take up her cues in the amorous comedy which I had had written out in my mind from my earliest boyhood, and in which every nice girl seemed to me to be equally desirous of playing, provided that she had also some of the physical qualifications required. In this play, whoever the new star might be whom I invited to create or to revive the leading part, the plot, the incidents, the lines themselves preserved an unalterable form<br>
<br>
    Within the next few days, in spite of the reluctance that Albertine had shewn from introducing me to them, I knew all the little band of that first afternoon (except Gisèle, whom, owing to a prolonged delay at the level crossing by the station and a change in the time-table, I had not succeeded in meeting on the train, which had been gone some minutes before I arrived, and to whom as it happened I never gave another thought), and two or three other girls as well to whom at my request they introduced me. And thus, my expectation of the pleasure which I should find in a new girl springing from another girl through whom I had come to know her, the latest was like one of those new varieties of rose which gardeners get by using first a rose of another kind. And as I passed from blossom to blossom along this flowery chain, the pleasure of knowing one that was different would send me back to her to whom I was indebted for it, with a gratitude in which desire was mingled fully as much as in my new expectation. Presently I was spending all my time among these girls<br>
<br>
    Alas! in the freshest flower it is possible to discern those just perceptible signs which to the instructed mind indicate already what will be, by the desiccation or fructification of the flesh that is to-day in bloom, the ultimate form, immutable and already predestinate, of the autumnal seed. The eye rapturously follows a nose like a wavelet that deliriously curls the water’s face at daybreak and seems not to move, to be capturable by the pencil, because the sea is so calm then that one does not notice its tidal flow. Human faces seem not to change while we are looking at them, because the revolution which they perform is too slow for us to perceive it. But we have only to see, by the side of any of those girls, her mother or her aunt, to realise the distance over which, obeying the gravitation of a type that is, generally speaking, deplorable, her features will have travelled in less than thirty years, and must continue to travel until the sunset hour, until her face, having vanished altogether below the horizon, catches the light no more. I knew that, as deep, as ineluctable as is their Jewish patriotism or Christian atavism in those who imagine themselves to be the most emancipated of their race, there dwelt beneath the rosy inflorescence of Albertine, Rosemonde, Andrée, unknown to themselves, held in reserve until the circumstances should arise, a coarse nose, a protruding jaw, a bust that would create a sensation when it appeared, but was actually in the wings, ready to “come on,” just as it might be a burst of Dreyfusism, or clericalism, sudden, unforeseen, fatal, some patriotic, some feudal form of heroism emerging suddenly when the circumstances demand it from a nature anterior to that of the man himself, by means of which he thinks, lives, evolves, gains strength himself or dies, without ever being able to distinguish that nature from the successive phases which in turn he takes for it. Even mentally, we depend a great deal more than we think upon natural laws, and our mind possesses already, like some cryptogamous plant, every little peculiarity that we imagine ourselves to be selecting. For we can see only the derived ideas, without detecting the primary cause (Jewish blood, French birth or whatever it may be) that inevitably produced them, and which at a given moment we expose. And perhaps, while the former appear to us to be the result of deliberate thought, the latter that of an imprudent disregard for our own health, we take from our family, as the papilionaceae take the form of their seed, as well the ideas by which we live as the malady from which we shall die<br>
<br>
    As on a plant whose flowers open at different seasons, I had seen, expressed in the form of old ladies, on this Balbec shore, those shrivelled seed-pods, those flabby tubers which my friends would one day be. But what matter? For the moment it was their flowering-time. And so when Mme. de Villeparisis asked me to drive with her I sought an excuse to be prevented. I never went to see Elstir unless accompanied by my new friends. I could not even spare an afternoon to go to Doncières, to pay the visit I had promised Saint-Loup. Social engagements, serious discussions, even a friendly conversation, had they usurped the place allotted to my walks with these girls, would have had the same effect on me as if, when the luncheon bell rang, I had been taken not to a table spread with food but to turn the pages of an album. The men, the youths, the women, old or mature, whose society we suppose that we shall enjoy, are borne by us only on an unsubstantial plane surface, because we are conscious of them only by visual perception restricted to its own limits; whereas it is as delegates from our other senses that our eyes dart towards young girls; the senses follow, one after another, in search of the various charms, fragrant, tactile, savoury, which they thus enjoy even without the aid of fingers and lips; and able, thanks to the art of transposition, the genius for synthesis in which desire excels, to reconstruct beneath the hue of cheeks or bosom the feel, the taste, the contact that is forbidden them, they give to these girls the same honeyed consistency as they create when they stand rifling the sweets of a rose-garden, or before a vine whose clusters their eyes alone devour<br>
<br>
    If it rained, although the weather had no power to daunt Albertine, who was often to be seen in her waterproof spinning on her bicycle through the driving showers, we would Spend the day in the Casino, where on such days it would have seemed to me impossible not to go. I had the greatest contempt for the young Ambresacs, who had never set foot in it. And I willingly joined my friends in playing tricks on the dancing master. As a rule we had to listen to admonition from the manager, or from some of his staff, usurping dictatorial powers, because my friends, even Andrée herself, whom on that account I had regarded when I first saw her as so dionysiac a creature, whereas in reality she was delicate, intellectual, and this year far from well, in spite of which her actions were controlled less by the state of her health than by the spirit of that age which overcomes every other consideration and confounds in a general gaiety the weak with the strong, could not enter the outer hall of the rooms without starting to run, jumping over all the chairs, sliding back along the floor, their balance maintained by a graceful poise of their outstretched arms, singing the while, mingling all the arts, in that first bloom of youth, in the manner of those poets of ancient days for whom the different ‘kinds’ were not yet separate, so that in an epic poem they would introduce rules of agriculture with theological doctrine<br>
<br>
    This Andrée who had struck me when I first saw them as the coldest of them all, was infinitely more refined, more loving, more sensitive than Albertine, to whom she displayed the caressing, gentle affection of an elder sister. At the Casino she would come across the floor to sit down by me, and knew instinctively, unlike Albertine, to refuse my invitation to dance, or even, if I was tired, to give up the Casino and come to me instead at the hotel. She expressed her friendship for me, for Albertine, in terms which were evidence of the most exquisite understanding of the things of the heart, which may have been partly due to the state of her health. She had always a merry smile of excuse for the childish behaviour of Albertine, who expressed with a crude violence the irresistible temptation held out to her by the parties and picnics to which she had not the sense, like Andrée, resolutely to prefer staying and talking with me. When the time came for her to go off to a luncheon party at the golf-club, if we were all three together she would get ready to leave us, then, coming up to Andrée: “Well, Andrée, what are you waiting for now? You know we are lunching at the golf-club.” “No; I’m going to stay and talk to him,” replied Andrée, pointing to me. “But you know, Mme. Durieux invited you,” cried Albertine, as if Andree’s intention to remain with me could be explained only by ignorance on her part where else and by whom she had been bidden. “Look here, my good girl, don’t be such an idiot,” Andrée chid her. Albertine did not insist, fearing a suggestion that she too should stay with me. She tossed her head. “Just as you like,” was her answer, uttered in the tone one uses to an invalid whose self-indulgence is killing him by inches, “I must fly; I’m sure your watch is slow,” and off she went. “She is a dear girl, but quite impossible,” said Andrée, bathing her friend in a smile at once caressing and critical. If in this craze for amusement Albertine might be said to echo something of the old original Gilberte, that is because a certain similarity exists, although the type evolves, between all the women we love, a similarity that is due to the fixity of our own temperament, which it is that chooses them, eliminating all those who would not be at once our opposite and our complement, fitted that is to say to gratify our senses and to wring our heart. They are, these women, a product of our temperament, an image inversely projected, a negative of our sensibility. So that a novelist might, in relating the life of his hero, describe his successive love-affairs in almost exactly similar terms, and thereby give the impression not that he was repeating himself but that he was creating, since an artificial novelty is never so effective as a repetition that manages to suggest a fresh truth. He ought, moreover, to indicate in the character of the lover a variability which becomes apparent as the story moves into fresh regions, into different latitudes of life. And perhaps he would be stating yet another truth if while investing all the other persons of his story with distinct characters he refrained from giving any to the beloved. We understand the characters of people who do not interest us; how can we ever grasp that of a person who is an intimate part of our existence, whom after a little we no longer distinguish in any way from ourselves, whose motives provide us with an inexhaustible supply of anxious hypotheses which we perpetually reconstruct. Springing from somewhere beyond our understanding, our curiosity as to the woman whom we love overleaps the bounds of that woman’s character, which we might if we chose but probably will not choose to stop and examine. The object of our uneasy investigation is something more essential than those details of character comparable to the tiny particles of epidermis whose varied combinations form the florid originality of human flesh. Our intuitive radiography pierces them, and the images which it photographs for us, so far from being those of any single face, present rather the joyless universality of a skeleton<br>
<br>
    Andrée, being herself extremely rich while the other was penniless and an orphan, with real generosity lavished on Albertine the full benefit of her wealth. As for her feelings towards Gisèle, they were not quite what I had been led to suppose. News soon reached us of the young student, and when Albertine handed round the letter she had received, a letter intended by Gisèle to give an account of her journey and to report her safe arrival to the little band, pleading laziness as an excuse for not having written yet to the rest, I was surprised to hear Andrée (for I imagined an irreparable breach between them) say: “I shall write to her to-morrow, because if I wait for her to write I may have to wait for years, she’s such a slacker.” And, turning to myself, she added: “You saw nothing much in her, evidently; but she’s a jolly nice girl, and besides I’m really very fond of her.” From which I concluded that Andrée’s quarrels were apt not to last very long<br>
<br>
    Except on these rainy days, as we had always arranged to go on our bicycles along the cliffs, or on an excursion inland, an hour or so before it was time to start I would go upstairs to make myself smart and would complain if Françoise had not laid out all the things that I wanted. Now even in Paris she would proudly, angrily straighten a back which the years had begun to bend, at the first word of reproach, she so humble, she so modest and charming when her self-esteem was flattered. As this was the mainspring of her life: her satisfaction, her good humour were in direct ratio to the difficulty of the tasks imposed on her. Those which she had to perform at Balbec were so easy that she shewed almost all the time a discontent which was suddenly multiplied an hundredfold, with the addition of an ironic air of offended dignity when I complained, on my way down to join my friends, that my hat had not been brushed or my ties sorted. She who was capable of taking such endless pains, without in consequence assuming that she had done anything at all, on my simply remarking that a coat was not in its proper place, not only did she boast of the care with which she had “put it past sooner than let it go gathering the dust,” but, paying a formal tribute to her own labours, lamented that it was little enough of a holiday that she was getting at Balbec, and that we would not find another person in the whole world who would consent to put up with such treatment. “I can’t think how anyone can leave things lying about the way you do; you just try and get anyone else to find what you want in such a mix-up. The devil himself would give it up as a bad job.” Or else she would adopt a regal mien, scorching me with her fiery glance, and preserve a silence that was broken as soon as she had fastened the door behind her and was outside in the passage, which would then reverberate with utterances which I guessed to be insulting, though they remained as indistinct as those of characters in a play whose opening lines are spoken in the wings, before they appear on the stage. And even if nothing was missing and Françoise was in a good temper, still she made herself quite intolerable when I was getting ready to go out with my friends. For, drawing upon a store of stale witticisms at their expense which, in my need to be talking about the girls, I had made in her hearing, she put on an air of being about to reveal to me things of which I should have known more than she had there been any truth in her statements, which there never was, Françoise having misunderstood what she had heard. She had, like most people, her own ways; a person is never like a straight highway, but surprises us with the strange, unavoidable windings of his course through life, by which, though some people may not notice them, we find it a perpetual annoyance to be stopped and hindered. Whenever I arrived at the stage of “Where is my hat?” or uttered the name of Andrée or Albertine, I was forced by Françoise to stray into endless and absurd side-tracks which greatly delayed my progress. So too when I asked her to cut me the sandwiches of cheese or salad, or sent her out for the cakes which I was to eat while we rested on the cliffs, sharing them with the girls, and which the girls “might very well have taken turns to provide, if they had not been so close,” declared Françoise, to whose aid there came at such moments a whole heritage of atavistic peasant rapacity and coarseness, and for whom one would have said that the soul of her late enemy Eulalie had been broken into fragments and reincarnate, more attractively than it had ever been in Saint-Eloi’s, in the charming bodies of my friends of the little band. I listened to these accusations with a dull fury at finding myself brought to a standstill at one of those places beyond which the well-trodden country path that was Françoise’s character became impassable, though fortunately never for very long. Then, my hat or coat found and the sandwiches ready, I sailed out to find Albertine, Andrée, Rosemonde, and any others there might be, and on foot or on our bicycles we would start<br>
<br>
    In the old days I should have preferred our excursion to be made in bad weather. For then I still looked to find in Balbec the ‘Cimmerians’ land,’ and fine days were a thing that had no right to exist there, an intrusion of the vulgar summer of seaside holiday-makers into that ancient region swathed in eternal mist. But now, everything that I had hitherto despised, shut out of my field of vision, not only effects of sunlight upon sea and shore, but even the regattas, the race-meetings, I would have sought out with ardour, for the reason for which formerly I had wanted only stormy seas, which was that these were now associated in my mind, as the others had been, with an aesthetic idea. Because I had gone several times with my new friends to visit Elstir, and, on the days when the girls were there, what he had selected to shew us were drawings of pretty women in yachting dress, or else a sketch made on a race-course near Balbec. I had at first shyly admitted to Elstir that I had not felt inclined to go to the meetings that were being held there. “You were wrong,” he told me, “it is such a pretty sight, and so well worth seeing. For one thing, that peculiar animal, the jockey, on whom so many eager eyes are fastened, who in the paddock there looks so grim, a colourless face between his brilliant jacket and cap, one body and soul with the prancing horse he rides, how interesting to analyse his professional movements, the bright splash of colour he makes, with the horse’s coat blending in it, as they stream down the course. What a transformation of every visible object in that luminous vastness of a racecourse where one is constantly surprised by fresh lights and shades which one sees only there. How charming the women can look there, too! The first day’s racing was quite delightful, and there were women there exquisitely dressed, in the misty light of a Dutch landscape, in which one could feel rising to cloud the sun itself the penetrating coldness of the water. Never have I seen women arriving in carriages, or standing with glasses to their eyes in so extraordinary a light, which was due, I suppose, to the moisture from the sea. I should simply have loved to paint it. I came home from the races quite mad, and so keen to get to work! “After which he became more enthusiastic still over the yacht-races, and I realised that regattas, social fixtures where well-dressed women might be seen bathed in the greenish light of a marine race-course, might be for a modern artist as interesting a subject as were the revels which they so loved to depict for a Veronese or Carpaccio. When I suggested this to Elstir, “Your comparison is all the more true,” he replied, “since, from the position of the city in which they painted, those revels were to a great extent aquatic. Except that the beauty of the shipping in those days lay as a rule in its solidity, in the complication of its structure. They had water-tournaments, as we have here, held generally in honour of some Embassy, such as Carpaccio shews us in his Legend of Saint Ursula. The vessels were massive, built up like architecture, and seemed almost amphibious, like lesser Venices set in the heart of the greater, when, moored to the banks by hanging stages decked with crimson satin and Persian carpets, they bore their freight of ladies in cherry-red brocade and green damask close under the balconies incrusted with many-coloured marbles from which other ladies leaned to gaze at them, in gowns with black sleeves slashed with white, stitched with pearls or bordered with lace. You cannot tell where the land ends and the water begins, what is still the palace or already the vessel, the caravel, the galeas, the Bucintoro.” Albertine had listened with the keenest interest to these details of costume, these visions of elegance that Elstir was describing to us. “Oh, I should so like to see that lace you speak of; it’s so pretty, the Venice-point,” she cried. “Besides, I should love to see Venice.” “You may, perhaps, before very long, be able,” Elstir informed her, “to gaze upon the marvellous stuffs which they used to wear. Hitherto one has seen them only in the works of the Venetian painters, or very rarely among the treasures of old churches, except now and then when a specimen has come into the sale-room. But I hear that a Venetian artist, called Fortuny, has recovered the secret of the craft, and that before many years have passed women will be able to walk abroad, and better still to sit at home in brocades as sumptuous as those that Venice adorned, for her patrician daughters, with patterns brought from the Orient. But I don’t know that I should much care for that, that it wouldn’t be too much of an anachronism for the women of to-day, even when they parade at regattas, for, to return to our modern pleasure-craft, the times have completely changed since ‘Venice, Queen of the Adriatic.’ The great charm of a yacht, of the furnishings of a yacht, of yachting dress, is their simplicity, as just things for the sea, and I do so love the sea. I must confess to you that I prefer the fashions of to-day to those of Veronese’s and even of Carpaccio’s time. What there is so attractive about our yachts — and the smaller yachts especially, I don’t like the huge ones, they’re too much like ships; yachts are like women’s hats, you must keep within certain limits — is the unbroken surface, simple, gleaming, grey, which under a cloudy, leaden sky takes on a creamy softness. The cabin in which we live ought to make us think of a little café. And women’s clothes on board a yacht are the same sort of thing; what really are charming are those light garments, uniformly white, of cloth or linen or nankeen or drill, which in the sunlight and against the blue of the sea shew up with as dazzling a whiteness as a spread sail. You very seldom see a woman, for that matter, who knows how to dress, and yet some of them are quite wonderful. At the races, Mlle. Léa had a little white hat and a little white sunshade, simply enchanting. I don’t know what I wouldn’t give for that little sunshade.” I should have liked very much to know in what respect this little sunshade differed from any other, and for other reasons, reasons of feminine vanity, Albertine was still more curious. But, just as Françoise used to explain the excellence of her soufflés by “It’s the way you do them,” so here the difference lay in the cut. “It was,” Elstir explained, “quite tiny, quite round, like a Chinese umbrella.” I mentioned the sunshades carried by various ladies, but it was not like any of them. Elstir found them all quite hideous. A man of exquisite taste, singularly hard to please, he would isolate some minute detail which was the whole difference between what was worn by three-quarters of the women he saw, and horrified him, and a thing which enchanted him by its prettiness; and — in contrast to its effect on myself, whose mind any display of luxury at once sterilised — stimulated his desire to paint “so as to make something as attractive.” “Here you see a young lady who has guessed what the hat and sunshade were like,” he said to me, pointing to Albertine whose eyes shone with envy. “How I should love to be rich, to have a yacht!” she said to the painter. “I should come to you to tell me how to run it. What lovely trips I’d take. And what fun it would be to go to Cowes for the races. And a motor-car! Tell me, do you think the ladies’ fashions for motoring pretty?” “No”; replied Elstir, “but that will come in time. You see, there are very few firms at present, one or two only, Callot — although they go in rather too freely for lace — Doucet, Cheruit, Paquin sometimes. The others are all horrible.” “Then, is there a vast difference between a Callot dress and one from any ordinary shop?” I asked Albertine. “Why, an enormous difference, my little man! I beg your pardon! Only, alas! what you get for three hundred francs in an ordinary shop will cost two thousand there. But there can be no comparison; they look the same only to people who know nothing at all about it.” “Quite so,” put in Elstir; “though I should not go so far as to say that it is as profound as the difference between a statue from Rheims Cathedral and one from Saint-Augustin. By the way, talking of cathedrals,” he went on, addressing himself exclusively to me, because what he was saying had reference to an earlier conversation in which the girls had not taken part, and which for that matter would not have interested them at all, “I spoke to you the other day of Balbec Church as a great cliff, a huge breakwater built of the stone of the country; now look at this”; he handed me a water-colour. “Look at these cliffs (it’s a sketch I did close to here, at the Creuniers); don’t these rocks remind you of a cathedral?” And indeed one would have taken them for soaring red arches. But, painted on a roasting hot day, they seemed to have crumbled into dust, made volatile by the heat which had drunk up half the sea, distilled over the whole surface of the picture almost into a gaseous state. On this day on which the sunlight had, so to speak, destroyed reality, reality concentrated itself in certain dusky and transparent creatures which, by contrast, gave a more striking, a closer impression of life: the shadows. Ravening after coolness, most of them, deserting the scorched open spaces, had fled for shelter to the foot of the rocks, out of reach of the sun; others, swimming gently upon the tide, like dolphins, kept close under the sides of the moving vessels, whose hulls they extended upon the pale surface of the water with their glossy blue forms. It was perhaps the thirst for coolness which they conveyed that did most to give me the sensation of the heat of this day and made me exclaim how much I regretted not knowing the Creuniers. Albertine and Andrée were positive that I must have been there hundreds of times. If so I had been there without knowing it, never suspecting that one day the sight of these rocks was to inspire me with such a thirst for beauty, not perhaps exactly natural beauty such as I had been seeking hitherto among the cliffs of Balbec, but rather architectural. Above all, I who, having come here to visit the kingdom of the storm, had never found, on any of my drives with Mme. de Villeparisis, when often we saw it only from afar, painted in a gap between the trees, the ocean sufficiently real, sufficiently liquid, giving a sufficient impression that it was hurling its massed forces against the shore, and would have liked to see it lie motionless only under a wintry shroud of fog, I could never have believed that I should now be dreaming of a sea which was nothing more than a whitish vapour that had lost both consistency and colour. But of such a sea Elstir, like the people who sat musing on board those vessels drowsy with the heat, had so intensely felt the enchantment that he had succeeded in transcribing, in fixing for all time upon the painted sheet the imperceptible reflux of the tide, the throb of one happy moment; and one suddenly became so enamoured, at the sight of this magic portrait, that one could think of nothing else than to range the world over, seeking to recapture the vanished day in its instantaneous, slumbering beauty<br>
<br>
    So that if before these visits to Elstir, before I had set eyes on one of his sea-pictures in which a young woman in a dress of white serge or linen, on the deck of a yacht flying the American flag, had duplicated a white linen dress and coloured flag in my imagination which at once bred in me an insatiable desire to visit the spot and see there with my own eyes white linen dresses and flags against the sea, as though no such experience had ever yet befallen me, always until then I had taken care when I stood by the sea to expel from my field of vision, as well as the bathers in the foreground, the yachts with their too dazzling sails that were like seaside costumes, everything that prevented me from persuading myself that I was contemplating the immemorial flood of ocean which had been moving with the same mysterious life before the appearance of the human race; and had grudged even the days of radiant sunshine which seemed to me to invest with the trivial aspect of the world’s universal summer this coast of fog and tempest, to mark simply an interruption, equivalent to what in music is known as a rest; now on the other hand it was the bad days that appeared to me to be some disastrous accident, a thing that could no longer find any place for itself in the world of beauty; I felt a keen desire to go out and recapture in reality what had so powerfully aroused my imagination, and I hoped that the weather would be propitious enough for me to see from the summit of the cliff the same blue shadows as were in Elstir’s picture<br>
<br>
    Nor, as I went along, did I still make a frame about my eyes with my hands as in the days when, conceiving nature to be animated by a life anterior to the first appearance of man, and inconsistent with all those wearisome perfections of industrial achievement which had hitherto made me yawn with boredom at Universal Exhibitions or in the milliners’ windows, I endeavoured to include only that section of the sea over which there was no steamer passing, so that I might picture it to myself as immemorial, still contemporary with the ages in which it had been set apart from the land, or at least with the first dawn of life in Greece, which enabled me to repeat in their literal meaning the lines of ‘Father Leconte’ of which Bloch was so fond:<br>
<br>
            ‘Gone are the Kings, gone are their towering prows<br>
            Vanished upon the raging deep, alas<br>
            The long-haired warrior heroes of Hellas.’<br>
<br>
    I could no longer despise the milliners, now that Elstir had told me that the delicate touches by which they give a last refinement, a supreme caress to the ribbons or feathers of a hat after it is finished, would be as interesting to him to paint as the muscular action of the jockeys themselves (a statement which had delighted Albertine). But I must wait until I had returned — for milliners, to Paris — for regattas and races to Balbec, where there would be no more now until next year-. Even a yacht with women in white linen garments was not to be found<br>
<br>
    Often we encountered Bloch’s sisters, to whom I was obliged to bow since I had dined with their father. My new friends did not know them. “I am not allowed to play with Israelites,” Albertine explained. Her way of pronouncing the word —‘Issraelites’ instead of ‘Izraelites’— would in itself have sufficed to shew, even if one had not heard the rest of the sentence, that it was no feeling of friendliness towards the chosen race that inspired these young Frenchwomen, brought up in God-fearing homes, and quite ready to believe that the Jews were in the habit of massacring Christian children. “Besides, they’re shocking bad form, your friends,” said Andrée with a smile which implied that she knew very well that they were no friends of mine. “Like everything to do with the tribe,” went on Albertine, in the sententious tone of one who spoke from personal experience. To tell the truth, Bloch’s sisters, at once overdressed and half naked, with their languishing, bold, blatant, sluttish air did not create the best impression. And one of their cousins, who was only fifteen, scandalised the Casino by her unconcealed admiration for Mlle. Lea, whose talent as an actress M. Bloch senior rated very high, but whose tastes were understood to lead her not exactly in the direction of the gentlemen<br>
<br>
    Some days we took our refreshment at one of the outlying farms which catered to visitors. These were the farms known as Les Ecorres, Marie-Thérèse, La Croix d’Heuland, Bagatelle, Californie and Marie-Antoinette. It was the last that had been adopted by the little band<br>
<br>
    But at other times, instead of going to a farm, we would climb to the highest point of the cliff, and, when we had reached it and were seated on the grass, would undo our parcel of sandwiches and cakes. My friends preferred the sandwiches, and were surprised to see me eat only a single chocolate cake, sugared with gothic tracery, or an apricot tart. This was because, with the sandwiches of cheese or of green-stuff, a form of food that was novel to me and knew nothing of the past, I had nothing in common. But the cakes understood, the tarts were gossips. There were in the former an insipid taste of cream, in the latter a fresh taste of fruit which knew all about Combray, and about Gilberte, not only the Gilberte of Combray but her too of Paris, at whose tea-parties I had found them again. They reminded me of those cake-plates of the Arabian Nights pattern, the subjects on which were such a distraction to my aunt Léonie when Françoise brought her up, one day, Aladdin or the Wonderful Lamp, another day Ali-Baba, or the Sleeper Awakes, or Sinbad the Sailor embarking at Bassorah with all his treasure. I should dearly have liked to see them again, but my grandmother did not know what had become of them, and thought moreover that they were just common plates that had been bought in the village. No matter, in that grey, midland Combray scene they and their pictures were set like many-coloured jewels, as in the dark church were the windows with their shifting radiance, as in the dusk of my bedroom were the projections cast by the magic-lantern, as in the foreground of the view of the railway-station and the little local line the buttercups from the Indies and the Persian lilacs, as were my great-aunt’s shelves of old porcelain in the sombre dwelling of an elderly lady in a country town<br>
<br>
    Stretched out on the cliff I would see before me nothing but grassy meadows and beyond them not the seven heavens of the Christian cosmogony but two stages only, one of a deeper blue, the sea, and over it another more pale. We ate our food, and if I had brought with me also some little keepsake which might appeal to one or other of my friends, joy sprang with such sudden violence into her translucent face, flushed in an instant, that her lips had not the strength to hold it in, and to allow it to escape parted in a shout of laughter. They had gathered close round me, and between their faces which were almost touching one another the air that separated them traced azure pathways such as might have been cut by a gardener wishing to clear the ground a little so as to be able himself to move freely through a thicket of roses<br>
<br>
    When we had finished eating we would play games which until then I should have thought boring, sometimes such childish games as King of the Castle, or Who Laughs First; not for a kingdom would I have renounced them now; the rosy dawn of adolescence, with which the faces of these girls were still aglow, and from which I, young as I was, had already emerged, shed its light on everything round about them and, like the fluid painting of some of the Primitives, brought out the most insignificant details of their daily lives in relief against a golden background. Even the faces of the girls were, for the most part, clouded with this misty effulgence of a dawn from which their actual features had not yet emerged. One saw only a charming sheet of colour beneath which what in a few years’ time would be a profile was not discernible. The profile of to-day had nothing definite about it, and could be only a momentary resemblance to some deceased member of the family to whom nature had paid this commemorative courtesy. It comes so soon, the moment when there is nothing left to wait for, when the body is fixed in an immobility which holds no fresh surprise in store, when one loses all hope on seeing — as on a tree in the height of summer leaves already brown — round a face still young hair that is growing thin or turning grey; it is so short, that radiant morning time that one comes to like only the very youngest girls, those in whom the flesh, like a precious leaven, is still at work. They are no more yet than a stream of ductile matter, moulded ever afresh by the fleeting impression of the moment. You would say that each of them was in turn a little statuette of childish gaiety, of a child grown earnest, coaxing, surprised, taking its pattern from an expression frank and complete, but fugitive. This plasticity gives a wealth of variety and charm to the pretty attentions which a little girl pays to us. Of course, such attentions are indispensable in the woman also, and she whom we do not attract, or who fails to let us see that we have attracted her, tends to assume in our eyes a somewhat tedious uniformity. But even these pretty attentions, after a certain age, cease to send gentle ripples over a face which the struggle for existence has hardened, has rendered unalterably militant or ecstatic. One — owing to the prolonged strain of the obedience that subjects wife to husband — will seem not so much a woman’s face as a soldier’s; another, carved by the sacrifices which a mother has consented to make, day after day, for her children, will be the face of an apostle. A third is, after a stormy passage through the years, the face of an ancient mariner, upon a body of which its garments alone indicate the sex. Certainly the attentions that a woman pays us can still, so long as we are in love with her, scatter fresh charms over the hours that we spend in her company. But she is not then for us a series of different women. Her gaiety remains external to an unchanging face. Whereas adolescence is anterior to this complete solidification; and from this it follows that we feel, in the company of young girls, the refreshing sense that is afforded us by the spectacle of forms undergoing an incessant process of change, a play of unstable forces which makes us think of that perpetual re-creation of the primordial elements of nature which we contemplate when we stand by the sea<br>
<br>
    It was not merely a social engagement, a drive with Mme. de Villeparisis, that I would have sacrificed to the ‘Ferret’ or ‘Guessing Games’ of my friends. More than once, Robert de Saint-Loup had sent word that, since I was not coming to see him at Doncières, he had applied for twenty-four hours’ leave, which he would spend at Balbec. Each time I wrote back that he was on no account to come, offering the excuse that I should be obliged to be away myself that very day, when I had some duty call to pay with my grandmother on family friends in the neighbourhood. No doubt I fell in his estimation when he learned from his aunt in what the ‘duty call’ consisted, and who the persons were who combined to play the part of my grandmother. And yet I had not been wrong, perhaps, after all, in sacrificing not only the vain pleasures of the world but the real pleasure of friendship to that of spending the whole day in this green garden. People who enjoy the capacity — it is true that such people are artists, and I had long been convinced that I should never be that — are also under an obligation to live for themselves. And friendship is a dispensation from this duty, an abdication of self. Even conversation, which is the mode of expression of friendship, is a superficial digression which gives us no new acquisition. We may talk for a lifetime without doing more than indefinitely repeat the vacuity of a minute, whereas the march of thought in the solitary travail of artistic creation proceeds downwards, into the depths, in the only direction that is not closed to us, along which we are free to advance — though with more effort, it is true — towards a goal of truth. And friendship is not merely devoid of virtue, like conversation, it is fatal to us as well. For the sense of boredom which it is impossible not to feel in a friend’s company (when, that is to say, we must remain exposed on the surface of our consciousness, instead of pursuing our voyage of discovery into the depths) for those of us in whom the law of development is purely internal — that first impression of boredom our friendship impels us to correct when we are alone again, to recall with emotion the words uttered by our friend, to look upon them as a valuable addition to our substance, albeit we are not like buildings to which stones can be added from without, but like trees which draw from their own sap the knot that duly appears on their trunks, the spreading roof of their foliage. I was lying to myself, I was interrupting the process of growth in that direction in which I could indeed really be enlarged and made happy, when I congratulated myself on being liked, admired, by so good, so clever, so rare a creature as Saint-Loup, when I focussed my mind, not upon my own obscure impressions which duty bade me unravel, but on the words uttered by my friend, in which, when I repeated them to myself — when I had them repeated to me by that other self who dwells in us and on to whom we are always so ready to transfer the burden of taking thought — I strove to make myself find a beauty very different from that which I used to pursue in silence when I was really alone, but one that would enhance the merit of Robert, of myself, of my life. In the life which a friend like this provided for me, I seemed to myself to be comfortably preserved from solitude, nobly desirous of sacrificing myself for him, in fact quite incapable of realising myself. Among the girls, on the other hand, if the pleasure which I enjoyed was selfish, at least it was not based on the lie which seeks to make us believe that we are not irremediably alone, and which, when we talk to another person, prevents us from admitting that it is no longer we who speak, that we are fashioning ourselves in the likeness of strangers and not of our own ego, which is quite different from them. The words that passed between the girls of the little band and myself were not of any interest; they were, moreover, but few, broken by long spells of silence on my part. All of which did not prevent me from finding, in listening to them when they spoke to me, as much pleasure as in gazing at them, in discovering in the voice of each one of them a brightly coloured picture. It was with ecstasy that I caught their pipings. Love helps us to discern things, to discriminate. Standing in a wood, the lover of birds at once distinguishes the notes of the different species, which to ordinary people sound the same. The lover of girls knows that human voices vary even more. Each one possesses more notes than the richest instrument of music. And the combinations in which the voice groups those notes are as inexhaustible as the infinite variety of personalities. When I talked with any one of my friends I was conscious that the original, the unique portrait of her individuality had been skilfully traced, tyranically imposed on my mind as much by the inflexions of her voice as by those of her face, and that these were two separate spectacles which rendered, each in its own plane, the same single reality. No doubt the lines of the voice, like those of the face, were not yet definitely fixed; the voice had still to break, as the face to change. Just as children have a gland the secretion in which enables them to digest milk, a gland which is not found in grown men and women, so there were in the twitterings of these girls notes which women’s voices no longer contain. And on this instrument with its greater compass they played with their lips, shewing all the application, the ardour of Bellini’s little angel musicians, qualities which also are an exclusive appanage of youth. Later on these girls would lose that note of enthusiastic conviction which gave a charm to their simplest utterances, whether it were Albertine who, in a tone of authority, repeated puns to which the younger ones listened with admiration, until that wild impulse to laugh caught them all with the irresistible violence of a sneeze, or Andrée who began to speak of their work in the schoolroom, work even more childish seemingly than the games they played, with a gravity essentially puerile; and their words changed in tone, like the lyrics of ancient times when poetry, still hardly differentiated from music, was declaimed upon the different notes of a scale. In spite of which, the girls’ voices already gave a quite clear indication of the attitude that each of these little people had adopted towards life, an attitude so personal that it would be speaking in far too general terms to say of one: “She treats everything as a joke,” of another: “She jumps from assertion to assertion,” of a third: “She lives in a state of expectant hesitation.” The features of our face are hardly more than gestures which force of habit has made permanent. Nature, like the destruction of Pompeii, like the metamorphosis of a nymph into a tree, has arrested us in an accustomed movement. Similarly, our intonations embody our philosophy of life, what a person says to himself about things at any given moment. No doubt these peculiarities were to be found not only in the girls. They were those of their parents. The individual is a part of something that is more generally diffused than himself. By this reckoning, our parents furnish us not only with those habitual gestures which are the outlines of our face and voice, but also with certain mannerisms in speech, certain favourite expressions, which, almost as unconscious as an intonation, almost as profound, indicate likewise a definite point of view towards life. It is quite true, since we are speaking of girls, that there are certain of these expressions which their parents do not hand on to them until they have reached a certain age, as a rule not before they are women. These are kept in reserve. Thus, for instance, if you were to speak of the pictures of one of Elstir’s friends, Andrée, whose hair was still ‘down,’ could not yet make use, personally, of the expression which her mother and elder sister employed: “It appears, the man is quite charming!” But that would come in due course, when she was allowed to go to the Palais-Royal. And already, since her first communion, Albertine had begun to say, like a friend of her aunt: “I’m sure I should find that simply terrible!” She had also had given to her, as a little present, the habit of repeating whatever you had just been saying to her, so as to appear to be interested, and to be trying to form an opinion of her own. If you said that an artist’s work was good, or his house nice, “Oh, his work is good, is it?” “Oh, his house is nice, is it?” Last of all, and even more general than the family heritage, was the rich layer imposed by the native province from which they derived their voices and of which indeed their intonations smacked. When Andrée sharply struck a solemn note she could not prevent the Perigordian string of her vocal instrument from giving back a resonant sound quite in harmony, moreover, with the Meridional purity of her features; while to the incessant pranks of Rosemonde the substance of her North-Country face and voice responded, whatever her mood at the time, in the accent of their province. Between that province and the temperament of the little girl who dictated these inflexions, I caught a charming dialogue. A dialogue, not in any sense a discord. It would not have been possible to separate the girl herself and her native place. She was herself; she was still it also. Moreover this reaction of locally procured materials on the genius who utilises them and to whose work their reaction imparts an added freshness, does not make the work any less individual, and whether it be that of an architect, a cabinet-maker or a composer, it reflects no less minutely the most subtle shades of the artist’s personality, because he has been compelled to work in the millstone of Senlis or the red sandstone of Strasbourg, has respected the knots peculiar to the ash-tree, has borne in mind, when writing his score, the resources, the limitations, the volume of sound, the possibilities of flute or alto voice<br>

    All this I realised, and yet we talked so little. Whereas with Mme. de Villeparisis or Saint-Loup I should have displayed by my words a great deal more pleasure than I should actually have felt, for I used always to be worn out when I parted from them; when, on the other hand, I was lying on the grass among all these girls, the plenitude of what I was feeling infinitely outweighed the paucity, the infrequency of our speech, and brimmed over from my immobility and silence in floods of happiness, the waves of which rippled up to die at the feet of these young roses<br>
<br>
    For a convalescent who rests all day long in a flower-garden or orchard, a scent of flowers or fruit does not more completely pervade the thousand trifles that compose his idle hours than did for me that colour, that fragrance in search of which my eyes kept straying towards the girls, and the sweetness of which finally became incorporated in me. So it is that grapes grow sugary in sunshine. And by their slow continuity these simple little games had gradually wrought in me also, as in those who do nothing else all day but lie outstretched by the sea, breathing the salt air and growing sunburned, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague sense of dizziness that had spread from brain to eyes<br>
<br>
    Now and then a pretty attention from one or another of them would stir in me vibrations which dissipated for a time my desire for the rest. Thus one day Albertine had suddenly asked: “Who has a pencil?” Andrée had provided one, Rosemonde the paper; Albertine had warned them: “Now, young ladies, you are not to look at what I write.” After carefully tracing each letter, supporting the paper on her knee, she had passed it to me with: “Take care no one sees.” Whereupon I had unfolded it and read her message, which was: “I love you.”<br>
<br>
    “But we mustn’t sit here scribbling nonsense,” she cried, turning impetuously, with a sudden gravity of demeanour, to Andrée and Rosemonde<br>
<br>
    “I ought to shew you the letter I got from Gisèle this morning. What an idiot I am; I’ve had it all this time in my pocket — and you can’t think how important it may be to us.” Gisèle had been moved to copy out for her friend, so that it might be passed on to the others, the essay which she had written in her certificate examination. Albertine’s fears as to the difficulty of the subjects set had been more than justified by the two from which Gisèle had had to choose. The first was: “Sophocles, from the Shades, writes to Racine to console him for the failure of Athalie“; the other: “Suppose that, after the first performance of Esther, Mme. de Sévigné is writing to Mme. de La Fayette to tell her how much she regretted her absence.” Now Gisèle, in an excess of zeal which ought to have touched the examiners’ hearts, had chosen the former, which was also the more difficult of the two subjects, and had handled it with such remarkable skill that she had been given fourteen marks, and had been congratulated by the board. She would have received her ‘mention’ if she had not ‘dried up’ in the Spanish paper. The essay, a copy of which Gisèle had now sent her, was immediately read aloud to us by Albertine, for, having presently to pass the same examination, she was anxious to have an opinion from Andrée, who was by far the cleverest of them all and might be able to give her some good ‘tips.’ “She did have a bit of luck!” was Albertine’s comment.“It’s the very subject her French mistress made her swot up while she was here.” The letter from Sophocles to Racine, as drafted by Gisèle, ran as follows: “My dear friend, You must pardon me the liberty of addressing you when I have not the honour of your personal acquaintance, but your latest tragedy, Athalie, shews, does it not, that you have made the most thorough study of my own modest works. You have not only put poetry in the mouths of the protagonists, or principal persons of the drama, but you have written other, and, let me tell you without flattery, charming verses for the choruses, a feature which was not too bad, according to all one hears, in Greek Tragedy, but is a complete novelty in France. Nay more, your talent always so fluent, so finished, so winning, so fine, so delicate, has here acquired an energy on which I congratulate you. Athalie, Joad — these are figures which your rival Corneille could have wrought no better. The characters are virile, the plot simple and strong. You have given us a tragedy in which love is not the keynote, and on this I must offer you my sincerest compliments. The most familiar proverbs are not always the truest. I will give you an example:<br>
<br>
            ‘This passion treat, which makes the poet’s art<br>
            Fly, as on wings, straight to the listener’s heart.’<br>
<br>
    You have shewn us that the religious sentiment in which your choruses are steeped is no less capable of moving us. The general public may have been puzzled at first, but those who are best qualified to judge must give you your due. I have felt myself impelled to offer you all my congratulations, to which I would add, my dear brother poet, an expression of my very highest esteem.” Albertine’s eyes, while she was reading this to us, had not ceased to sparkle. “Really, you’d think she must have cribbed it somewhere!” she exclaimed, as she reached the end. “I should never have believed that Gisèle could hatch out anything like as good! And the poetry she brings in! Where on earth can she have got that from?” Albertine’s admiration, with a change, it is true, of object, but with no loss — an increase, rather — of intensity, combined with the closest attention to what was being said, continued to make her eyes ‘start from her head’ all the time that Andrée (consulted as being the biggest of the band and more knowledgeable than the others) first of all spoke of Gisèle’s essay with a certain irony, then with a levity of tone which failed to conceal her underlying seriousness proceeded to reconstruct the letter in her own way. “It is not badly done,” she told Albertine, “but if I were you and had the same subject set me, which is quite likely, as they do very often set that, I shouldn’t do it in that way. This is how I would tackle it. Well, first of all, if I had been Gisèle, I should not have let myself get tied up, I should have begun by making a rough sketch of what I was going to write on a separate piece of paper. On the top line I should state the question and give an account of the subject, then the general ideas to be worked into the development. After that, appreciation, style, conclusion. In that way, with a summary to refer to, you know where you are. But at the very start, where she begins her account of the subject, or, if you like, Titine, since it’s a letter we’re speaking of, where she comes to the matter, Gisèle has gone off the rails altogether. Writing to a person of the seventeenth century, Sophocles ought never to have said, ‘My dear friend.’” “Why, of course, she ought to have said, ‘My dear Racine,’” came impetuously from Albertine. “That would have been much better.” “No,” replied Andrée, with a trace of mockery in her tone, “she ought to have put ‘Sir.’ In the same way, to end up, she ought to have thought of something like, ‘Suffer me, Sir,’ (at the very most, ‘Dear Sir’) to inform you of the sense of high esteem with which I have the honour to be your servant.’ Then again, Gisèle says that the choruses in Athalie are a novelty. She is forgetting Esther, and two tragedies that are not much read now but happen to have been analysed this year by the Professor himself, so that you need only mention them, since he’s got them on the brain, and you’re bound to pass. I mean Les Juives, by Robert Gamier, and Montchrestien’s L’Aman.” Andrée quoted these titles without managing quite to conceal a secret sense of benevolent superiority, which found expression in a smile, quite a delightful smile, for that matter. Albertine could contain herself no — longer. “Andrée, you really are a perfect marvel,” she cried. “You must write down those names for me. Just fancy, what luck it would be if I got on to that, even in the oral, I should bring them in at once and make a colossal impression.” But in the days that followed, every time that Albertine begged Andrée just to tell her again the names of those two plays so that she might write them down, her blue-stocking friend seemed most unfortunately to have forgotten them, and left her none the wiser. “And another thing,” Andrée went on with the faintest note in her voice of scorn for companions so much younger than herself, though she relished their admiration and attached to the manner in which she herself would have composed the essay a greater importance than she wanted us to think, “Sophocles in the Shades must be kept well-informed of all that goes on. He must know, therefore, that it was not before the general public but before the King’s Majesty and a few privileged courtiers that Athalie was first played. What Gisèle says in this connexion of the esteem of qualified judges is not at all bad, but she might have gone a little further. Sophocles, now that he is immortal, might quite well have the gift of prophecy and announce that, according to Voltaire,Athalie is to be the supreme achievement not of Racine merely but of the human mind.” Albertine was drinking in every word. Her eyes blazed. And it was with the utmost indignation that she rejected Rosemonde’s suggestion that they should begin to play. “And so,” Andrée concluded, in the same easy, detached tone, blending a faint sneer with a certain warmth of conviction, “if Gisèle had noted down properly, first of all, the general ideas that she was going to develop, it might perhaps have occurred to her to do what I myself should have done, point out what a difference there is between the religious inspiration of Sophocles’s choruses and Racine’s. I should have made Sophocles remark that if Racine’s choruses are instinct with religious feeling like those of the Greek Tragedians, the gods are not the same. The God of Joad has nothing in common with the god of Sophocles. And that brings us quite naturally, when we have finished developing the subject, to our conclusion: What does it matter if their beliefs are different? Sophocles would hesitate to insist upon such a point. He would be afraid of wounding Racine’s convictions, and so, slipping in a few appropriate words on his masters at Port-Royal, he prefers to congratulate his disciple on the loftiness of his poetic genius.”<br>
<br>
    Admiration and attention had so heated Albertine that great drops were rolling down her cheeks. Andrée preserved the unruffled calm of a female dandy. “It would not be a bad thing either to quote some of the opinions of famous critics,” she added, before they began their game. “Yes,” put in Albertine, “so I’ve been told. The best ones to quote, on the whole, are Sainte-Beuve and Merlet, aren’t they?” “Well, you’re not absolutely wrong,” Andrée told her, “Merlet and Sainte-Beuve are by no means bad. But you certainly ought to mention Deltour and Gascq-Desfossés.” She refused, however, despite Albertine’s entreaties, to write down these two unfamiliar names<br>
<br>
    Meanwhile I had been thinking of the little page torn from a scribbling block which Albertine had handed me. “I love you,” she had written. And an hour later, as I scrambled down the paths which led back, a little too vertically for my liking, to Balbec, I said to myself that it was with her that I would have my romance<br>
<br>
    The state of being indicated by the presence of all the signs by which we are accustomed to recognise that we are in love, such as the orders which I left in the hotel not to awaken me whoever might ask to see me, unless it were one or other of the girls, the beating of my heart while I waited for her (whichever of them it might be that I was expecting) and on those mornings my fury if I had not succeeded in finding a barber to shave me, and must appear with the disfigurement of a hairy chin before Albertine, Rosemonde or Andrée, no doubt this state, recurring indifferently at the thought of one or another, was as different from what we call love as is from human life the life of the zoophytes, where an existence, an individuality, if we may term it, is divided up among several organisms. But natural history teaches us that such an organization of animal life is indeed to be observed, and that our own life, provided only that we have outgrown the first phase, is no less positive as to the reality of states hitherto unsuspected by us, through which we have to pass, and can then abandon them altogether. Such was for me this state of love divided among several girls at once. Divided — say rather undivided, for more often than not what was so delicious to me, different from the rest of the world, what was beginning to become so precious to me that the hope of finding it again on the morrow was the greatest happiness in my life, was rather the whole of the group of girls, taken as they were all together on those afternoons on the cliffs, during those lifeless hours, upon that strip of grass on which were laid those forms, so exciting to my imagination, of Albertine, Rosemonde, Andrée; and that without my being able to say which of them it was that made those scenes so precious to me, which of them I was most anxious to love. At the start of a new love as at its ending, we are not exclusively attached to the object of that love, but rather the desire to be loving from which it will presently emerge (and, later on, the memory which it leaves behind) wanders voluptuously through a zone of interchangeable charms — simply natural charms, it may be, gratification of appetite, enjoyment of one’s surroundings — which are so far harmonised among themselves that it does not in the presence of any one of them feel itself out of place. Besides, as my perception of them was not yet dulled by familiarity, I had still the faculty of seeing them, that is to say of feeling a profound astonishment every time that I found myself in their presence. No doubt this astonishment is to some extent due to the fact that the other person on such occasions presents himself in a fresh aspect; but so great is the multiformity of each of us, so abundant the wealth of lines of face and body, lines so few of which leave any trace, once we have parted from the other person, on the arbitrary simplicity of our memory. As our mind has selected some peculiarity that had struck us, has isolated it, exaggerated it, making of a woman who has appeared to us tall, a sketch in which her figure is absurdly elongated, or of a woman who has seemed to be pink-cheeked and golden-haired a pure ‘Harmony in pink and gold,’ so, the moment that woman is once again standing before us, all the other forgotten qualities which restore the balance of that one remembered feature at once assail us, in their confused complexity, diminishing her height, paling her cheeks, and substituting for what we have come to her solely to seek other peculiarities which we remember now that we did notice the first time, and fail to understand how we can so far have forgotten to look out for again. We thought we remembered; it was a peahen, surely; we go to see it and find a peony. And this inevitable astonishment is not the only one; for, side by side with it comes another, born of the difference, not now between the stereotyped forms of memory and reality, but between the person whom we saw last time and him who appears to us to-day from another angle and shews us another aspect. The human face is indeed, like the face of the God of some Oriental theogony, a whole cluster of faces, crowded together but on different surfaces so that one does not see them all at once<br>
<br>
    But to a great extent our astonishment springs from the other person’s presenting to us also a face that is the same as before. It would require so immense an effort to reconstruct everything that has been imparted to us by things other than ourselves — were it only the taste of a fruit — that no sooner is the impression received than we begin imperceptibly to descend the slope of memory and, without noticing anything, in a very short time, we have come a long way from what we actually felt. So that every fresh encounter is a sort of rectification, which brings us back to what we really did see. We have no longer any recollection of this, to such an extent does what we call remembering a person consist really in forgetting him. But so long as we can still see at the moment when the forgotten aspect appears, we recognise it, we are obliged to correct the straying line; thus the perpetual and fruitful surprise which made so salutary and invigorating for me these daily outings with the charming damsels of the sea shore, consisted fully as much in recognition as in discovery. When there is added to this the agitation aroused by what these girls were to me, which was never quite what I had supposed, and meant that my expectancy of our next meeting resembled not so much my expectancy the time before as the still throbbing memory of our latest conversation, it will be realised that each of our excursions made a violent interruption in the course of my thoughts and moved them clean out of the direction which, in the solitude of my own room, I had been able to trace for them at my leisure. That plotted course was forgotten, had ceased to exist, when I returned home buzzing like a hive of bees with remarks which had disquieted me when I heard them and were still echoing in my brain. The other person is destroyed when we cease to see him; after which his next appearance means a fresh creation of him, different from that which immediately preceded it, if not from them all. For the minimum variation that is to be found in these creations is duality. If we have in mind a strong and searching glance, a bold manner, it is inevitably, next time, by a half-languid profile, a sort of dreamy gentleness, overlooked by us in our previous impression, that we shall be, on meeting him again, astonished, that is to say almost solely struck. In confronting our memory with the new reality it is this that will mark the extent of our disappointment or surprise, will appear to us like the revised version of an earlier reality warning us that we had not remembered it correctly. In its turn, the facial aspect neglected the time before, and for that very reason the most striking this time, the most real, the most documentary, will become a matter for dreams and memories. It is a languorous and rounded profile, a gentle, dreamy expression which we shall now desire to see again. And then, next time, such resolution, such strength of character as there may be in the piercing eyes, the pointed nose, the tight lips, will come to correct the discrepancy between our desire and the object to which it has supposed itself to correspond. It is understood, of course, that this loyalty to the first and purely physical impressions which I formed afresh at each encounter with my friends did not involve only their facial appearance, since the reader has seen that I was sensible also of their voices, more disquieting still, perhaps (for not only does a voice offer the same strange and sensuous surfaces as a face, it issues from that unknown, inaccessible region the mere thought of which sets the mind swimming with unattainable kisses), their voices each like the unique sound of a little instrument into which the player put all her artistry and which was found only in her possession. Traced by a casual inflexion, a sudden deep chord in one of their voices would astonish me when I recognised after having forgotten it. So much so that the corrections which after every fresh meeting I was obliged to make so as to ensure absolute accuracy were as much those of a tuner or singing-master as a draughtsman’s<br>
<br>
    As for the harmonious cohesion in which had been neutralised for some time, by the resistance that each brought to bear against the expansion of the others, the several waves of sentiment set in motion in me by these girls, it was broken in Albertine’s favour one afternoon when we were playing the game of ‘ferret.’ It was in a little wood on the cliff. Stationed between two girls, strangers to the little band, whom the band had brought in its train because we wanted that day to have a bigger party than usual, I gazed enviously at Albertine’s neighbour, a young man, saying to myself that if I had been in his place I could have been touching my friend’s hands all those miraculous moments which might perhaps never recur, and that this would have been but the first stage in a great advance. Already, by itself, and even without the consequences which it would probably have involved, the contact of Albertine’s hands would have been delicious to me. Not that I had never seen prettier hands than hers. Even in the group of her friends, those of Andrée, slender hands and much more finely modelled, had as it were a private life of their own, obedient to the commands of their mistress, but independent, and used often to strain out before her like a leash of thoroughbred greyhounds, with lazy pauses, long dreams, sudden stretchings of a joint, seeing which Elstir had made a number of studies of these hands. And in one of them, in which you saw Andrée warming her hands at the fire, they had, with the light behind them, the gilded transparency of two autumn leaves. But, plumper than these, the hands of Albertine would yield for a moment, then resist the pressure of the hand that clasped them, giving a sensation that was quite peculiar to themselves. The act of pressing Albertine’s hand had a sensual sweetness which was in keeping somehow with the rosy, almost mauve colouring of her skin. That pressure seemed to allow you to penetrate into the girl’s being, to plumb the depths of her senses, like the ringing sound of her laughter, indecent as may be the cooing of doves or certain animal cries. She was the sort of woman with whom shaking hands affords so much pleasure that one feels grateful to civilisation for having made of the handclasp a lawful act between young men and girls when they meet. If the arbitrary code of good manners had replaced the clasp of hands by some other gesture, I should have gazed, day after day, at the unattainable hands of Albertine with a curiosity to know the feel of them as ardent as was my curiosity to learn the savour of her cheeks. But in the pleasure of holding her hand unrestrictedly in mine, had I been next to her at ‘ferret’ I did not envisage that pleasure alone; what avowals, declarations silenced hitherto by my bashfulness, I could have conveyed by certain pressures of hand on hand; on her side, how easy it would have been for her, in responding by other pressures, to shew me that she accepted; what complicity, what a vista of happiness stood open! My love would be able to make more advance in a few minutes spent thus by her side than it had yet made in all the time that I had known her. Feeling that they would last but a short time, were rapidly nearing their end, since presumably we were not going on much longer with this game, and that once it was over I should be too late, I could not keep in my place for another moment. I let myself deliberately be caught with the ring, and, having gone into the middle, when the ring passed I pretended not to see it but followed its course with my eyes, waiting for the moment when it should come into the hands of the young man next to Albertine, who herself, pealing with helpless laughter, and in the excitement and pleasure of the game, was blushing like a rose. “Why, we really are in the Fairy Wood!” said Andrée to me, pointing to the trees that grew all round, with a smile in her eyes which was meant only for me and seemed to pass over the heads of the other players, as though we two alone were clever enough to double our parts, and make, in connexion with the game we were playing, a remark of a poetic nature. She even carried the delicacy of her fancy so far as to sing half-unconsciously: “The Ferret of the Wood has passed this way, Sweet Ladies; he has passed by this way, the Ferret of Fairy Wood!” like those people who cannot visit Trianon without getting up a party in Louis XVI costume, or think in effective to have a song sung to its original setting. I should no doubt have been sorry that I could see no charm in this piece of mimicry, had I had time to think of it. But my thoughts were all elsewhere. The players began to shew surprise at my stupidity in never getting the ring. I was looking at Albertine, so pretty, so indifferent, so gay, who, though she little knew it, was to be my neighbour when at last I should catch the ring in the right hands, thanks to a stratagem which she did not suspect, and would certainly have resented if she had. In the heat of the game her long hair had become loosened, and fell in curling locks over her cheeks on which it served to intensify, by its dry brownness, the carnation pink. “You have the tresses of Laura Dianti, of Eleanor of Guyenne, and of her descendant so beloved of Chateaubriand. You ought always to wear your hair half down like that,” I murmured in her ear as an excuse for drawing close to her. Suddenly the ring passed to her neighbour. I sprang upon him at once, forced open his hands and seized it; he was obliged now to take my place inside the circle, while I took his beside Albertine. A few minutes earlier I had been envying this young man, when I saw that his hands as they slipped over the cord were constantly brushing against hers. Now that my turn was come, too shy to seek, too much moved to enjoy this contact, I no longer felt anything save the rapid and painful beating of my heart. At one moment Albertine leaned towards me, with an air of connivance, her round and rosy face, making a show of having the ring, so as to deceive the ferret, and keep him from looking in the direction in which she was just going to pass it. I realised at once that this was the sole object of Albertine’s mysterious, confidential gaze, but I was a little shocked to see thus kindle in her eyes the image — purely fictitious, invented to serve the needs of the game — of a secret, an understanding between her and myself which did not exist, but which from that moment seemed to me to be possible and would have been divinely sweet. While I was still being swept aloft by this thought, I felt a slight pressure of Albertine’s hand against mine, and her caressing finger slip under my finger along the cord, and I saw her, at the same moment, give me a wink which she tried to make pass unperceived by the others. At once, a mass of hopes, invisible hitherto by myself, crystallised within me. “She is taking advantage of the game to let me feel that she really does love me,” I thought to myself, in an acme of joy, from which no sooner had I reached it than I fell, on hearing Albertine mutter furiously: “Why can’t you take it? I’ve been shoving it at you for the last hour.” Stunned with grief, I let go the cord, the ferret saw that ring and swooped down on it, and I had to go back into the middle, where I stood helpless, in despair, looking at the unbridled rout which continued to circle round me, stung by the jeering shouts of all the players, obliged, in reply, to laugh when I had so little mind for laughter, while Albertine kept on repeating: “People can’t play if they don’t pay attention, and spoil the game for the others. He shan’t be asked again when we’re going to play, Andrée; if he is, I don’t come.” Andrée, with a mind above the game, still chanting her ‘Fairy Wood’ which, in a spirit of imitation, Rosemonde had taken up too, but without conviction, sought to make a diversion from Albertine’s reproaches by saying to me: “We’re quite close to those old Creuniers you wanted so much to see. Look, I’ll take you there by a dear little path, and we’ll leave these silly idiots to go on playing like babies in the nursery.” As Andrée was extremely nice to me, as we went along I said to her everything about Albertine that seemed calculated to make me attractive to the latter. Andrée replied that she too was very fond of Albertine, thought her charming; in spite of which the compliments that I was paying to her friend did not seem altogether to please her. Suddenly, in the little sunken path, I stopped short, touched to the heart by an exquisite memory of my childhood. I had just recognised, by the fretted and glossy leaves which it thrust out towards me, a hawthorn-bush, flowerless, alas, now that spring was over. Around me floated the atmosphere of far-off Months of Mary, of Sunday afternoons, of beliefs, or errors long ago forgotten. I wanted to stay it in its passage. I stood still for a moment, and Andrée, with a charming divination of what was in my mind, left me to converse with the leaves of the bush. I asked them for news of the flowers, those hawthorn flowers that were like merry little girls, headstrong, provocative, pious. “The young ladies have been gone from here for a long time now,” the leaves told me. And perhaps they thought that, for the great friend of those young ladies that I pretended to be, I seemed to have singularly little knowledge of their habits. A great friend, but one who had never been to see them again for all these years, despite his promises. And yet, as Gilberte had been my first love among girls, so these had been my first love among flowers. “Yes, I know all that, they leave about the middle of June,” I answered, “but I am so delighted to see the place where they stayed when they were here. They came to see me, too, at Combray, in my room; my mother brought them when I was ill in bed. And we used to meet on Saturday evenings, too, at the Month of Mary devotions. Can they get to them from here?” “Oh, of course! Why, they make a special point of having our young ladies at Saint-Denis du Désert, the church near here.” “Then, if I want to see them now?” “Oh, not before May, next year.” “But I can be sure that they will be here?” “They come regularly every year.” “Only I don’t know whether it will be easy to find the place.” “Oh, dear, yes! They are so gay, the young ladies, they stop laughing only to sing hymns together, so that you can’t possibly miss them, you can tell by the scent from the other end of the path.”<br>
<br>
    I caught up Andrée, and began again to sing Albertine’s praises. It was inconceivable to me that she would not repeat what I said to her friend, seeing the emphasis that I put into it. And yet I never heard that Albertine had been told. Andrée had, nevertheless, a far greater understanding of the things of the heart, a refinement of nice behaviour; finding the look, the word, the action that could most ingeniously give pleasure, keeping to herself a remark that might possibly cause pain, making a sacrifice (and making it as though it were no sacrifice at all) of an afternoon’s play, or it might be an ‘at home’ or a garden party in order to stay beside a friend who was feeling sad, and thus shew him or her that she preferred the simple company of a friend to frivolous pleasures; these were her habitual delicacies. But when one knew her a little better one would have said that it was with her as with those heroic cravens who wish not to be afraid, and whose bravery is especially meritorious, one would have said that in her true character there was none of that generosity which she displayed at every moment out of moral distinction, or sensibility, or a noble desire to shew herself a true friend. When I listened to all the charming things she was saying to me about a possible affection between Albertine and myself it seemed as though she were bound to do everything in her power to bring it to pass. Whereas, by mere chance perhaps, not even of the least of the various minor opportunities which were at her disposal and might have proved effective in uniting me to Albertine did she ever make any use, and I would not swear that my effort to make myself loved by Albertine did not — if not provoke in her friend secret stratagems destined to bring it to nought — at any rate arouse in her an anger which however she took good care to hide and against which even, in her delicacy of feeling, she may herself have fought. Of the countless refinements of goodness which Andrée shewed Albertine would have been incapable, and yet I was not certain of the underlying goodness of the former as I was to be, later on, of the latter’s. Shewing herself always tenderly indulgent to the exuberant frivolity of Albertine, Andrée would greet her with speeches, with smiles which were those of a friend, better still, she always acted towards her as a friend. I have seen her, day after day, in order to give the benefit of her own wealth, to bring some happiness to this penniless friend take, without any possibility of advantage to herself, more pains than a courtier would take who sought to win his sovereign’s favour. She was charmingly gentle always, charming in her choice of sweet, pathetic expressions, when you said to her what a pity it was that Albertine was so poor, and took infinitely more trouble on her behalf than she would have taken for a wealthy friend. But if anyone were to hint that Albertine was perhaps not quite so poor as people made out, a just discernible cloud would veil the light of Andrée’s eyes and brow; she seemed out of temper. And if you went on to say that after all Albertine might perhaps be less difficult to marry off than people supposed, she would vehemently contradict you, repeating almost angrily: “Oh dear, no; she will never get married! I am quite certain of it; it is a dreadful worry to me!” In so far as I myself was concerned, Andrée was the only one of the girls who would never have repeated to me anything not very pleasant that might have been said about me by a third person; more than that, if it were I who told her what had been said she would make a pretence of not believing it, or would furnish some explanation which made the remark inoffensive; it is the aggregate of these qualities that goes by the name of tact. Tact is the attribute of those people who, if we have called a man out in a duel, congratulate us and add that there was no necessity, really; so as to enhance still further in our own eyes the courage of which we have given proof without having been forced to do lo. They are the opposite of the people who, in similar circumstances, say: “It must have been a horrid nuisance for you, fighting a duel, but on the other hand you couldn’t possibly swallow an insult like that, there was nothing else to be done.” But as there, is always something to be said on both sides, if the pleasure, or at least the indifference shewn by our friends in repeating something offensive that they have heard said about us, proves that they do not exactly put themselves in our skin at the moment of speaking, but thrust in the pin-point, turn the knife-blade as though it were gold-beater’s skin and not human, the art of always keeping hidden from us what might be disagreeable to us in what they have heard said about our actions, or in the opinion which those actions have led the speakers themselves to form of us, proves that there is in the other kind of friends, in the friends who are so full of tact, a strong vein of dissimulation. It does no harm if indeed they are incapable of thinking evil, and if what is said by other people only makes them suffer as it would make us. I supposed this to be the case with Andrée, without, however, being absolutely sure<br>
<br>
    We had left the little wood and had followed a network of overgrown paths through which Andrée managed to find her way with great skill. Suddenly, “Look now,” she said to me, “there are your famous Creuniers, and, I say, you are in luck, it’s just the time of day, and the light is the same as when Elstir painted them.” But I was still too wretched at having fallen, during the game of ‘ferret,’ from such a pinnacle of hopes. And so it was not with the pleasure which otherwise I should doubtless have felt that I caught sight, almost below my feet, crouching among the rocks, where they had gone for protection from the heat, of marine goddesses for whom Elstir had lain in wait and surprised them there, beneath a dark glaze as lovely as Leonardo would have painted, the marvellous Shadows, sheltered and furtive, nimble and voiceless, ready at the first glimmer of light to slip behind the stone, to hide in a cranny, and prompt, once the menacing ray had passed, to return to rock or seaweed beneath the sun that crumbled the cliffs and the colourless ocean, over whose slumbers they seemed to be watching, motionless lightfoot guardians letting appear on the water’s surface their viscous bodies and the attentive gaze of their deep blue eyes<br>
<br>
    We went back to the wood to pick up the other girls and go home together. I knew now that I was in love with Albertine; but, alas! I had no thought of letting her know it. This was because, since the days of our games in the Champs-Elysées, my conception of love had become different, even if the persons to whom my love was successively assigned remained practically the same. For one thing, the avowal, the declaration of my passion to her whom I loved no longer seemed to me one of the vital and necessary incidents of love, nor love itself an external reality, but simply a subjective pleasure. And as for this pleasure, I felt that Albertine would do everything necessary to furnish it, all the more since she would not know that I was enjoying it<br>
<br>
    As we walked home the image of Albertine, bathed in the light that streamed from the other girls, was not the only one that existed for me. But as the moon, which is no more than a tiny white cloud of a more definite and fixed shape than other clouds during the day, assumes her full power as soon as daylight dies, so when I was once more in the hotel it was Albertine’s sole image that rose from my heart and began to shine. My room seemed to me to have become suddenly a new place. Of course, for a long time past, it had not been the hostile room of my first night in it. All our lives we go on patiently modifying the surroundings in which we dwell; and gradually, as habit dispenses us from feeling them, we suppress the noxious elements of colour, shape and smell which were at the root of our discomfort. Nor was it any longer the room, still potent enough over my sensibility, not certainly to make me suffer, but to give me joy, the fount of summer days, like a marble basin in which, half way up its polished sides, they mirrored an azure surface steeped in light over which glided for an instant, impalpable and white as a wave of heat, a shadowy and fleeting cloud; not the room, wholly aesthetic, of the pictorial evening hours; it was the room in which I had been now for so many days that I no longer saw it. And now I was just beginning again to open my eyes to it, but this time from the selfish angle which is that of love. I liked to feel that the fine big mirror across one corner, the handsome bookcases with their fronts of glass would give Albertine, if she came to see me, a good impression of myself. Instead of a place of transit in which I would stay for a few minutes before escaping to the beach or to Rivebelle, my room became real and dear to me, fashioned itself anew, for I looked at and appreciated each article of its furniture with the eyes of Albertine<br>
<br>
    A few days after the game of ‘ferret,’ when, having allowed ourselves to wander rather too far afield, we had been fortunate in finding at Maine-ville a couple of little “tubs” with two seats in each which would enable us to be back in time for dinner, the keenness, already intense, of my love for Albertine, had the following effect, first of all, that it was Rosemonde and Andrée in turn that I invited to be my companion, and never once Albertine, after which, in spite of my manifest preference for Andrée or Rosemonde, I led everybody, by secondary considerations of time and distance, cloaks and so forth, to decide, as though against my wishes, that the most practical policy was that I should take Albertine, to whose company I pretended to resign myself for good or ill. Unfortunately, since love tends to the complete assimilation of another person, while other people are not comestible by way of conversation alone, Albertine might be (and indeed was) as friendly as possible to me on our way home; when I had deposited her at her own door she left me happy but more famished for her even than I had been at the start, and reckoning the moments that we had spent together as only à prelude, of little importance in itself, to those that were still to come. And yet this prelude had that initial charm which is not to be found again. I had not yet asked anything of Albertine. She could imagine what I wanted, but, not being certain of it, would suppose that I was tending only towards relations without any definite purpose, in which my friend would find that delicious vagueness, rich in surprising fulfilments of expectations, which is true romance<br>
<br>
    In the week that followed I scarcely attempted to see Albertine. I made a show of preferring Andrée. Love is born; one would like to remain, for her whom one loves, the unknown whom she may love in turn, but one has need of her, one requires contact not so much with her body as with her attention, her heart. One slips into a letter some spiteful expression which will force the indifferent reader to ask for some little kindness in compensation, and love, following an unvarying procedure, sets going with an alternating movement the machinery in which one can no longer either refrain from loving or be loved. I gave to Andrée the hours spent by the others at a party which I knew that she would sacrifice for my sake, with pleasure, and would have sacrificed even with reluctance, from a moral nicety, so as not to let either the others or herself think that she attached any importance to a relatively frivolous amusement. I arranged in this way to have her entirely to myself every evening, meaning not to make Albertine jealous, but to improve my position in her eyes, or at any rate not to imperil it by letting Albertine know that it was herself and not Andrée that I loved. Nor did I confide this to Andrée either, lest she should repeat it to her friend. When I spoke of Albertine to Andrée I affected a coldness by which she was perhaps less deceived that I by her apparent credulity. She made a show of believing in my indifference to Albertine, of desiring the closest possible union between Albertine and myself. It is probable that, on the contrary, she neither believed in the one nor wished for the other. While I was saying to her that I did not care very greatly for her friend, I was thinking of one thing only, how to become acquainted with Mme. Bontemps, who was staying for a few days near Balbec, and to whom Albertine was going presently on a short visit. Naturally I did not let Andrée become aware of this desire, and when I spoke to her of Albertine’s people, it was in the most careless manner possible. Andrée’s direct answers did not appear to throw any doubt on my sincerity. Why then did she blurt out suddenly, about that time: “Oh, guess who’ I’ve just seen — Albertine’s aunt!” It is true that she had not said in so many words: “I could see through your casual remarks all right that the one thing you were really thinking of was how you could make friends with Albertine’s aunt.” But it was clearly to the presence in Andrée’s mind of some such idea which she felt it more becoming to keep from me that the word ‘just’ seemed to point. It was of a kind with certain glances, certain gestures which, for all that they have not a form that is logical, rational, deliberately calculated to match the listener’s intelligence, reach him nevertheless in their true significance, just as human speech, converted into electricity in the telephone, is turned into speech again when it strikes the ear. In order to remove from Andree’s mind the idea that I was interested in Mme. Bontemps, I spoke of her from that time onwards not only carelessly but with downright malice, saying that I had once met that idiot of a woman, and trusted I should never have that experience again. Whereas I was seeking by every means in my power to meet her<br>
<br>
    tried to induce Elstir (but without mentioning to anyone else that I had asked him) to speak to her about me and to bring us together. He promised to introduce me to her, though he seemed greatly surprised at my wishing it, for he regarded her as a contemptible woman, a born intriguer, as little interesting as she was disinterested. Reflecting that if I did see Mme. Bontemps, Andrée would be sure to hear of it sooner or later, I thought it best to warn her in advance. “The things one tries hardest to avoid are what one finds one cannot escape,” I told her. “Nothing in the world could bore me so much as meeting Mme. Bontemps again, and yet I can’t get out of it, Elstir has arranged to invite us together.” “I have never doubted it for a single instant,” exclaimed Andrée in a bitter tone, while her eyes, enlarged and altered by her annoyance, focussed themselves upon some invisible object. These words of Andree’s were not the most recent statement of a thought which might be expressed thus: “I know that you are in love with Albertine, and that you are working day and night to get in touch with her people.” But they were the shapeless fragments, easily pieced together again by me, of some such thought which I had exploded by striking it, through the shield of Andree’s self-control. Like her ‘just,’ these words had no meaning save in the second degree, that is to say they were words of the sort which (rather than direct affirmatives) inspires in us respect or distrust for another person, and leads to a rupture<br>
<br>
    If Andrée had not believed me when I told her that Albertine’s relatives left me indifferent, that was because she thought that I was in love with Albertine. And probably she was none too happy in the thought<br>
<br>
    She was generally present as a third party at my meetings with her friend. And yet there were days when I was to see Albertine by herself, days to which I looked forward with feverish impatience, which passed without bringing me any decisive result, without having, any of them, been that cardinal day whose part I immediately entrusted to the day that was to follow, which would prove no more apt to play it; thus there crumbled and collapsed, one after another, like waves of the sea, those peaks at once replaced by others<br>
<br>
    About a month after the day on which we had played ‘ferret’ together, I learned that Albertine was going away next morning to spend a couple of days with Mme. Bontemps, and, since she would have to start early, was coming to sleep that night at the Grand Hotel, from which, by taking the omnibus, she would be able, without disturbing the friends with whom she was staying, to catch the first train in the morning. I mentioned this to Andrée. “I don’t believe a word of it,” she replied, with a look of annoyance. “Anyhow it won’t help you at all, for I’m quite sure Albertine won’t want to see you if she goes to the hotel by herself. It wouldn’t be ‘regulation,’” she added, employing an epithet which had recently come into favour with her, in the sense of ‘what is done.’ “I tell you this because I understand Albertine. What difference do you suppose it makes to me, whether you see her or not? Not the slightest, I can assure you!”<br>
<br>
    We were joined by Octave who had no hesitation in telling Andrée the number of strokes he had gone round in, the day before, at golf, then by Albertine, counting her diabolo as she walked along, like a nun telling her beads. Thanks to this pastime she could be left alone for hours on end without growing bored. As soon as she joined us I became conscious of the obstinate tip of her nose, which I had omitted from my mental pictures of her during the last few days; beneath her dark hair the vertical front of her brow controverted — and not for the first time — the indefinite image that I had preserved of her, while its whiteness made a vivid splash in my field of vision; emerging from the dust of memory, Albertine was built up afresh before my eyes. Golf gives one a taste for solitary pleasures. The pleasure to be derived from diabolo is undoubtedly one of these. And yet, after she had joined us, Albertine continued to toss up and catch her missile, just as a lady on whom friends have come to call does not on their account stop working at her crochet. “I hear that Mme. de Villeparisis,” she remarked to Octave, “has been complaining to your father.” I could hear, underlying the word, one of those notes that were peculiar to Albertine; always, just as I had made certain that I had forgotten them, I would be reminded of a glimpse caught through them before of Albertine’s determined and typically Gallic mien. I might have been blind, and yet have detected certain of her qualities, alert and slightly provincial, from those notes, just as plainly as from the tip of her nose. These were equivalent and might have been substituted for one another, and her voice was like what we are promised in the photo-telephone of the future; the visual image was clearly outlined in the sound. “She’s not written only to your father, either, she wrote to the Mayor of Balbec at the same time, to say that we must stop playing diabolo on the ‘front’ as somebody hit her in the face with one.” “Yes, I was hearing about that. It’s too silly. There’s little enough to do here as it is.” Andrée did not join in the conversation; she was not acquainted, any more than was Albertine or Octave, with Mme. de Villeparisis. She did, however, remark: “I can’t think why this lady should make such a song about it. O’d Mme. de Cambremer got hit in the face, and she never complained.” “I will explain the difference,” replied Octave gravely, striking a match as he spoke. “It’s my belief that Mme. de Cambremer is a woman of the world, and Mme. de Villeparisis is just an upstart. Are you playing golf this afternoon?” And he left us, followed by Andrée. I was alone now with Albertine. “Do you see,” she began, “I’m wearing my hair now the way you like — look at my ringlet. They all laugh at me and nobody knows who’ I’m doing it for. My aunt will laugh at me too. But I shan’t tell her why, either.” I had a sidelong view of Albertine’s cheeks, which often appeared pale, but, seen thus, were flushed with a coursing stream of blood which lighted them up, gave them that dazzling clearness which certain winter mornings have when the stones sparkling in the sun seem blocks of pink granite and radiate joy. The joy that I was drawing at this moment from the sight of Albertine’s cheeks was equally keen, but led to another desire on my part, which was not to walk with her but to take her in my arms. I asked her if the report of her plans which I had heard were correct. “Yes,” she told me, “I shall be sleeping at your hotel to-night, and in fact as I’ve got rather a chill, I shall be going to bed before dinner. You can come and sit by my bed and watch me eat, if you like, and afterwards we’ll play at anything you choose. I should have liked you to come to the station to-morrow morning, but I’m afraid it might look rather odd, I don’t say to Andrée, who is a sensible person, but to the others who will be there; if my aunt got to know, I should never hear the last of it. But we can spend the evening together, at any rate. My aunt will know nothing about that. I must go and say good-bye to Andrée. So long, then. Come early, so that we can have a nice long time together,” she added, smiling. At these words I was swept back past the days in which I loved Gilberte to those in which love seemed to me not only an external entity but one that could be realised as a whole. Whereas the Gilberte whom I used to see in the Champs-Elysées was a different Gilberte from the one whom I found waiting inside myself when I was alone again, suddenly in the real Albertine, her whom I saw every day, whom I supposed to be stuffed with middle-class prejudices and entirely open with her aunt, there was incarnate the imaginary Albertine, she whom, when I still did not know her, I had suspected of casting furtive glances at myself on the ‘front,’ she who had worn an air of being reluctant to go indoors when she saw me making off in the other direction<br>
<br>
    I went in to dinner with my grandmother. I felt within me a secret which she could never guess. Similarly with Albertine; to-morrow her friends would be with her, not knowing what novel experience she and I had in common; and when she kissed her niece on the brow Mme. Bontemps would never imagine that I stood between them, in that arrangement of Albertine’s hair which had for its object, concealed from all the world, to give me pleasure, me who had until then so greatly envied Mme. Bontemps because, being related to the same people as her niece, she had the same occasions to don mourning, the same family visits to pay; and now I found myself meaning more to Albertine than did the aunt herself. When she was with her aunt, it was of me that she would be thinking. What was going to happen that evening, I scarcely knew. In any event, the Grand Hotel, the evening, would no longer seem empty to me; they contained my happiness. I rang for the lift-boy to take me up to the room which Albertine had engaged, a room that looked over the valley. The slightest movements, such as that of sitting down on the bench in the lift, were satisfying, because they were in direct relation to my heart; I saw in the ropes that drew the cage upwards, in the few steps that I had still to climb, only a materialisation of the machinery, the stages of my joy. I had only two or three steps to take now along the corridor before coming to that room in which was enshrined the precious substance of that rosy form — that room which, even if there were to be done in it delicious things, would keep that air of permanence, of being, to a chance visitor who knew nothing of its history, just like any other room, which makes of inanimate things the obstinately mute witnesses, the scrupulous confidants, the inviolable depositaries of our pleasure. Those few steps from the landing to Albertine’s door, those few steps which no one now could prevent my taking, I took with delight, with prudence, as though plunged into a new and strange element, as if in going forward I had been gently displacing the liquid stream of happiness, and at the same time with a strange feeling of absolute power, and of entering at length into an inheritance which had belonged to me from all time. Then suddenly I reflected that it was wrong to be in any doubt; she had told me to come when she was in bed. It was as clear as daylight; I pranced for joy, I nearly knocked over Françoise who was standing in my way, I ran, with glowing eyes, towards my friend’s room. I found Albertine in bed. Leaving her throat bare, her white nightgown altered the proportions of her face, which, flushed by being in bed or by her cold or by dinner, seemed pinker than before; I thought of the colours which I had had, a few hours earlier, displayed beside me, on the ‘front,’ the savour of which I was now at last to taste; her cheek was crossed obliquely by one of those long, dark, curling tresses, which, to please me, she had undone altogether. She looked at me and smiled. Beyond her, through the window, the valley lay bright beneath the moon. The sight of Albertine’s bare throat, of those strangely vivid cheeks, had so intoxicated me (that is to say had placed the reality of the world for me no longer in nature, but in the torrent of my sensations which it was all I could do to keep within bounds), as to have destroyed the balance between the life, immense and indestructible, which circulated in my being, and the life of the universe, so puny in comparison. The sea, which was visible through the window as well as the valley, the swelling breasts of the first of the Maineville cliffs, the sky in which the moon had not yet climbed to the zenith, all of these seemed less than a featherweight on my eyeballs, which between their lids I could feel dilated, resisting, ready to bear very different burdens, all the mountains of the world upon their fragile surface. Their orbit no longer found even the sphere of the horizon adequate to fill it. And everything that nature could have brought me of life would have seemed wretchedly meagre, the sigh of the waves far too short a sound to express the enormous aspiration that was surging in my breast. I bent over Albertine to kiss her. Death might have struck me down in that moment; it would have seemed to me a trivial, or rather an impossible thing, for life was not outside, it was in me; I should have smiled pityingly had a philosopher then expressed the idea that some day, even some distant day, I should have to die, that the external forces of nature would survive me, the forces of that nature beneath whose godlike feet I was no more than a grain of dust; that, after me, there would still remain those rounded, swelling cliffs, that sea, that moonlight and that sky! How was that possible; how could the world last longer than myself, since it was it that was enclosed in me, in me whom it went a long way short of filling, in me, where, feeling that there was room to store so many other treasures, I flung contemptuously into a corner sky, sea and cliffs. “Stop that, or I’ll ring the bell!” cried Albertine, seeing that I was flinging myself upon her to kiss her. But I reminded myself that it was not for no purpose that a girl made a young man come to her room in secret, arranging that her aunt should not know — that boldness, moreover, rewards those who know how to seize their opportunities; in the state of exaltation in which I was, the round face of Albertine, lighted by an inner flame, like the glass bowl of a lamp, started into such prominence that, copying the rotation of a burning sphere, it seemed to me to be turning, like those faces of Michelangelo which are being swept past in the arrested headlong flight of a whirlwind. I was going to learn the fragrance, the flavour which this strange pink fruit concealed. I heard a sound, precipitous, prolonged, shrill. Albertine had pulled the bell with all her might<br>
<br>
    * * *<br>
<br>
    I had supposed that the love which I felt for Albertine was not based on the hope of carnal possession. And yet, when the lesson to be drawn from my experience that evening was, apparently, that such possession was impossible; when, after having had not the least doubt, that first day, on the beach, of Albertine’s being unchaste, and having then passed through various intermediate assumptions, I seemed to have quite definitely reached the conclusion that she was absolutely virtuous; when, on her return from her aunt’s, a week later, she greeted me coldly with: “I forgive you; in fact I’m sorry to have upset you, but you must never do it again,”— then, in contrast to what I had felt on learning from Bloch that one could always have all the women one liked, and as if, in place of a real girl, I had known a wax doll, it came to pass that gradually there aetached itself from her my desire to penetrate into her life, to follow her through the places in which she had spent her childhood, to be initiated by her into the athletic life; my intellectual curiosity to know what were her thoughts on this subject or that did not survive my belief that I might take her in my arms if I chose. My dreams abandoned her, once they had ceased to be nourished by the hope of a possession of which I had supposed them to be independent. Thenceforward they found themselves once more at liberty to transmit themselves, according to the attraction that I had found in her on any particular day, above all according to the chances that I seemed to detect of my being, possibly, one day, loved by her — to one or another of Albertine’s friends, and to Andrée first of all. And yet, if Albertine had not existed, perhaps I should not have had the pleasure which I began to feel more and more strongly during the days that followed in the kindness that was shewn me by Andrée. Albertine told no one of the check which I had received at her hands. She was one of those pretty girls who, from their earliest youth, by their beauty, but especially by an attraction, a charm which remains somewhat mysterious and has its source perhaps in reserves of vitality to which others less favoured by nature come to quench their thirst, have always — in their home circle, among their friends, in society — proved more attractive than other more beautiful and richer girls; she was one of those people from whom, before the age of love and ever so much more after it is reached, one asks more than they ask in return, more even than they are able to give. From her childhood Albertine had always had round her in an adoring circle four or five little girl friends, among them Andrée who was so far her superior and knew it (and perhaps this attraction which Albertine exerted quite involuntarily had been the origin, had laid the foundations of the little band). This attraction was still potent even at a great social distance, in circles quite brilliant in comparison, where if there was a pavane to be danced, they would send for Albertine rather than have it danced by another girl of better family. The consequence was that, not having a penny to her name, living a hard enough life, moreover, on the hands of M. Bontemps, who was said to be ‘on the rocks,’ and was anyhow anxious to be rid of her, she was nevertheless invited, not only to dine but to stay, by people who, in Saint-Loup’s sight, might not have had any distinction, but to Rosemonde’s mother or Andrée’s, women who though very rich themselves did not know these other and richer people, represented something quite incalculable. Thus Albertine spent a few weeks every year with the family of one of the Governors of the Bank of France, who was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of a great Railway Company. The wife of this financier entertained people of importance, and had never mentioned her ‘day’ to Andrée’s mother, who thought her wanting in politeness, but was nevertheless prodigiously interested in everything that went on in her house. Accordingly she encouraged Andrée every year to invite Albertine down to their villa, because, as she said, it was a real charity to offer a holiday by the sea to a girl who had not herself the means to travel and whose aunt did so little for her; Andrée’s mother was probably not prompted by the thought that the banker and his wife, learning that Albertine was made much of by her and her daughter, would form a high opinion of them both; still less did she hope that Albertine, good and clever as she was, would manage to get her invited, or at least to get Andrée invited, to the financier’s garden-parties. But every evening at the dinner-table, while she assumed an air of indifference slightly tinged with contempt, she was fascinated by Albertine’s accounts of everything that had happened at the big house while she was staying there, and the names of the other guests, almost all of them people whom she knew by sight or by name. True, the thought that she knew them only in this indirect fashion, that is to say did not know them at all (she called this kind of acquaintance knowing people ‘all my life’), gave Andrée’s mother a touch of melancholy while she plied Albertine with questions about them in a lofty and distant tone, speaking with closed lips, and might have left her doubtful and uneasy as to the importance of her own social position had she not been able to reassure herself, to return safely to the ‘realities of life,’ by saying to the butler: “Please tell the chef that he has not made the peas soft enough.” She then recovered her serenity. And she was quite determined that Andrée was to marry nobody but a man — of the best family, of course — rich enough for her too to be able to keep a chef and a couple of coachmen. This was the proof positive, the practical indication of ‘position.’ But the fact that Albertine had dined at the banker’s house in the country with this or that great lady, and that the said great lady had invited the girl to stay with her next winter, did not invalidate a sort of special consideration which Albertine shewed towards Andrée’s mother, which went very well with the pity, and even repulsion, excited by the tale of her misfortunes, a repulsion increased by the fact that M. Bontemps had proved a traitor to the cause (he was even, people said, vaguely Panamist) and had rallied to the Government. Not that this deterred Andrée’s mother, in her passion for abstract truth, from withering with her scorn the people who appeared to believe that Albertine was of humble origin. “What’s that you say? Why, they’re one of the best families in the country. Simonet with a single ‘n,’ you know!” Certainly, in view of the class of society in which all this went on, in which money plays so important a part, and mere charm makes people ask you out but not marry you, a ‘comfortable’ marriage did not appear to be for Albertine a practical outcome of the so distinguished patronage which she enjoyed but which would not have been held to compensate for her poverty. But even by themselves, and with no prospect of any matrimonial consequence, Albertine’s ‘successes’ in society excited the envy of certain spiteful mothers, furious at seeing her received like one of the family by the banker’s wife, even by Andrée’s mother, neither of whom they themselves really knew. They therefore went about telling common friends of those ladies and their own that both ladies would be very angry if they knew the facts, which were that Albertine repeated to each of them everything that the intimacy to which she was rashly admitted enabled her to spy out in the household of the other, a thousand little secrets which it must be infinitely unpleasant to the interested party to have made public. These envious women said this so that it might be repeated and might get Albertine into trouble with her patrons. But, as often happens, their machinations met with no success. The spite that prompted them was too apparent, and their only result was to make the women who had planned them appear rather more contemptible than before. Andrée’s mother was too firm in her opinion of Albertine to change her mind about her now. She looked upon her as a ‘poor wretch,’ but the best-natured girl living, and one who would do anything in the world to give pleasure<br>
<br>
    If this sort of select popularity to which Albertine had attained did not seem likely to lead to any practical result, it had stamped Andrée’s friend with the distinctive marks of people who, being always sought after, have never any need to offer themselves, marks (to be found also, and for analogous reasons, at the other end of the social scale among the leaders of fashion) which consist in their not making any display of the successes they have scored, but rather keeping them to themselves. She would never say to anyone: “So-and-so is anxious to meet me,” would speak of everyone with the greatest good nature, and as if it had been she who ran after, who sought to know other people, and not they. If you spoke of a young man who, a few minutes earlier, had been, in private conversation with her, heaping the bitterest reproaches upon her because she had refused him an assignation, so far from proclaiming this in public, or betraying any resentment she would stand up for him: “He is such a nice boy!” Indeed it quite annoyed her when she attracted people, because that compelled her to disappoint them, whereas her natural instinct was always to give pleasure. So much did she enjoy giving pleasure that she had come to employ a particular kind of falsehood, found among utilitarians and men who have ‘arrived.’ Existing besides in an embryonic state in a vast number of people, this form of insincerity consists in not being able to confine the pleasure arising out of a single act of politeness to a single person. For instance, if Albertine’s aunt wished her niece to accompany her to a party which was not very lively, Albertine might have found it sufficient to extract from the incident the moral profit of having given pleasure to her aunt. But being courteously welcomed by her host and hostess, she thought it better to say to them that she had been wanting to see them for so long that she had finally seized this opportunity and begged her aunt to take her to their party. Even this was not enough: at the same party there happened to be one of Albertine’s friends who was in great distress. “I did not like the idea of your being here by yourself. I thought it might do you good to have me with you. If you would rather come away from here, go somewhere else, I am ready to do anything you like; all I want is to see you look not so sad.”— Which, as it happened, was true also. Sometimes it happened however that the fictitious object destroyed the real. Thus, Albertine, having a favour to ask on behalf of one of her friends, went on purpose to see a certain lady who could help her. But on arriving at the house of this lady — a kind and sympathetic soul — the girl, unconsciously following the principle of utilising a single action in a number of ways, felt it to be more ingratiating to appear to have come there solely on account of the pleasure she knew she would derive from seeing the lady again. The lady was deeply touched that Albertine should have taken a long journey purely out of friendship for herself. Seeing her almost overcome by emotion, Albertine began to like the lady still better. Only, there was this awkward consequence: she now felt so keenly the pleasure of friendship which she pretended to have been her motive in coming, that she was afraid of making the lady suspect the genuineness of sentiments which were actually quite sincere if she now asked her to do the favour, whatever it may have been, for her friend. The lady would think that Albertine had come for that purpose, which was true, but would conclude also that Albertine had no disinterested pleasure in seeing her, which was not. With the result that she came away without having asked the favour, like a man sometimes who has been so good to a woman, in the hope of winning her, that he refrains from declaring his passion in order to preserve for his goodness an air of nobility. In other instances it would be wrong to say that the true object was sacrificed to the subordinate and subsequently conceived idea, but the two were so far incompatible that if the person to whom Albertine endeared herself by stating the second had known of the existence of the first, his pleasure would at once have been turned into the deepest annoyance. At a much later point in this story, we shall have occasion to see this kind of incompatibility expressed in clearer terms. Let us say for the present, borrowing an example of a completely different order, that they occur very frequently in the most divergent situations that life has to offer. A husband has established his mistress in the town where he is quartered with his regiment. His wife, left by herself in Paris, and with an inkling of the truth, grows more and more miserable, and writes her husband letters embittered by jealousy. Very well; the mistress is obliged to go up to Paris for the day. The husband cannot resist her entreaties that he will go with her, and applies for short leave, which is granted. But as he is a good-natured fellow, and hates to make his wife unhappy, he goes to her and tells her, shedding a few quite genuine tears, that, driven to desperation by her letters, he has found the means of getting away from his duties to come to her, to console her in his arms. He has thus contrived by a single journey to furnish wife and mistress alike with proofs of his affection. But if the wife were to learn the reason for which he has come to Paris, her joy would doubtless be turned into grief, unless her pleasure in seeing the faithless wretch outweighed, in spite of everything, the pain that his infidelities had caused her. Among the men who have struck me as practising with most perseverance this system of what might be called killing any number of birds with one stone, must be included M. de Norpois. He would now and then agree to act as intermediary between two of his friends who had quarrelled, which led to his being called the most obliging of men. But it was not sufficient for him to appear to be doing a service to the friend who had come to him to demand it; he would represent to the other the steps which he was taking to effect a reconciliation as undertaken not at the request of the first friend but in the interest of the second, an attitude of the sincerity of which he had never any difficulty in convincing a listener already influenced by the idea that he saw before him the ‘most serviceable of men.’ In this fashion, playing in two scenes turn about, what in stage parlance is called ‘doubling’ two parts, he never allowed his influence to be in the slightest degree imperilled, and the services which he rendered constituted not an expenditure of capital but a dividend upon some part of his credit. At the same time every service, seemingly rendered twice over, correspondingly enhanced his reputation as an obliging friend, and, better still, a friend whose interventions were efficacious, one who did not draw bows at a venture, whose efforts were always justified by success, as was shewn by the gratitude of both parties. This duplicity in rendering services was — allowing for disappointments such as are the lot of every human being — an important element of M. de Norpois’s character. And often at the Ministry he would make use of my father, who was a simple soul, while making him believe that it was he, M. de Norpois, who was being useful to my father. Attracting people more easily than she wished, and having no need to proclaim her conquests abroad, Albertine kept silence with regard to the scene with myself by her bedside, which a plain girl would have wished the whole world to know. And yet of her attitude during that scene I could not arrive at any satisfactory explanation. Taking first of all the supposition that she was absolutely chaste (a supposition with which I had originally accounted for the violence with which Albertine had refused to let herself be taken in my arms and kissed, though it was by no means essential to my conception of the goodness, the fundamentally honourable character of my friend), I could not accept it without a copious revision of its terms. It ran so entirely counter to the hypothesis which I had constructed that day when I saw Albertine for the first time. Then ever so many different acts, all acts of kindness towards myself (a kindness that was caressing, at times uneasy, alarmed, jealous of my predilection for Andrée) came up on all sides to challenge the brutal gesture with which, to escape from me, she had pulled the bell. Why then had she invited me to come and spend the evening by her bedside? Why had she spoken all the time in the language of affection? What object is there in your desire to see a friend, in your fear that he is fonder of another of your friends than of you; why seek to give him pleasure, why tell him, so romantically, that the others will never know that he has spent the evening in your room, if you refuse him so simple a pleasure and if to you it is no pleasure at all? I could not believe, all the same, that Albertine’s chastity was carried to such a pitch as that, and I had begun to ask myself whether her violence might not have been due to some reason of coquetry, a disagreeable odour, for instance, which she suspected of lingering about her person, and by which she was afraid that I might be disgusted, or else of cowardice, if for instance she imagined, in her ignorance of the facts of love, that my state of nervous exhaustion was due to something contagious, communicable to her in a kiss. She was genuinely distressed by her failure to afford me pleasure, and gave me a little gold pencil-case, with that virtuous perversity which people shew who, moved by your supplications and yet not consenting to grant you what those supplications demand, are anxious all the same to bestow on you some mark of their affection; the critic, an article from whose pen would so gratify the novelist, asks him instead to dinner; the duchess does not take the snob with her to the theatre but lends him her box on an evening when she will not be using it herself. So far are those who do least for us, and might easily do nothing, driven by conscience to do something. I told Albertine that in giving me this pencil-case she was affording me great pleasure, and yet not so great as I should have felt if, on the night she had spent at the hotel, she had permitted me to embrace her. “It would have made me so happy; what possible harm could it have done you? I was simply astounded at your refusing to let me do it.” “What astounds me,” she retorted, “is that you should have thought it astounding. Funny sort of girls you must know if my behaviour surprises you.” “I am extremely sorry if I annoyed you, but even now I cannot say that I think I was in the wrong. What I feel is that all that sort of thing is of no importance, really, and I can’t understand a girl who could so easily give pleasure not consenting to do so. Let us be quite clear about it,” I went on, throwing a sop of sorts to her moral scruples, as I recalled how she and her friends had scarified the girl who went about with the actress Lea. “I don’t mean to say for a moment that a girl can behave exactly as she likes, or that there’s no such thing as immorality. Take, let me see now, yes, what you were saying the other day about a girl who is staying at Balbec and her relations with an actress; I call that degrading, so degrading that I feel sure it must all have been made up by the girl’s enemies, and that there can’t be any truth in the story. It strikes me as improbable, impossible. But to let a friend kiss you, and go farther than that even — since you say that I am your friend . . . ” “So you are, but I have had friends before now, I have known lots of young men who were every bit as friendly, I can assure you. There wasn’t one of them would ever have dared to do a thing like that. They knew they’d get their ears boxed if they tried it on. Besides, they never dreamed of trying, we would shake hands in an open, friendly sort of way, like good pals, but there was never a word said about kissing, and yet we weren’t any the less friends for that. Why, if it’s my friendship you are after, you’ve nothing to complain of; I must be jolly fond of you to forgive you. But I’m sure you don’t care two straws about me, really. Own up now, it’s Andrée you’re in love with. After all, you’re quite right; she is ever so much prettier than I am, and perfectly charming! Oh! You men!” Despite my recent disappointment, these words so frankly uttered, by giving me a great respect for Albertine, made a very pleasant impression on me. And perhaps this impression was to have serious and vexatious consequences for me later on, for it was round it that there began to form that feeling almost of brotherly intimacy, that moral core which was always to remain at the heart of my love for Albertine. A feeling of this sort may be the cause of the keenest pain. For in order really to suffer at the hands of a woman one must have believed in her completely. For the moment, that embryo of moral esteem, of friendship, was left embedded in me like a stepping-stone in a stream. It could have availed nothing, by itself, against my happiness if it had remained there without growing, in an inertia which it was to retain the following year, and still more during the final weeks of this first visit to Balbec. It dwelt in me like one of those foreign bodies which it would be wiser when all is said to expel, but which we leave where they are without disturbing them, so harmless for the present does their weakness, their isolation amid a strange environment render them<br>
<br>
    My dreams were now once more at liberty to concentrate on one or another of Albertine’s friends, and returned first of all to Andrée, whose kindnesses might perhaps have appealed to me less strongly had I not been certain that they would come to Albertine’s ears. Undoubtedly the preference that I had long been pretending to feel for Andrée had furnished me — in the habit of conversation with her, of declaring my affection — with, so to speak, the material, prepared and ready, for a love of her which had hitherto lacked only the complement of a genuine sentiment, and this my heart being once more free was now in a position to supply. But for me really to love Andrée, she was too intellectual, too neurotic, too sickly, too much like myself. If Albertine now seemed to me to be void of substance, Andrée was filled with something which I knew only too well. I had thought, that first day, that what I saw on the beach there was the mistress of some racing cyclist, passionately athletic; and now Andrée told me that if she had taken up athletic pastimes, it was under orders from her doctor, to cure her neurasthenia, her digestive troubles, but that her happiest hours were those which she spent in translating one of George Eliot’s novels. The misunderstanding, due to an initial mistake as to what Andrée was, had not, as a matter of fact, the slightest importance. But my mistake was one of the kind which, if they allow love to be born, and are not recognised as mistakes until it has ceased to be under control, become a cause of suffering. Such mistakes — which may be quite different from mine with regard to Andrée, and even its exact opposite — are frequently due (and this was especially the case here) to our paying too much attention to the aspect, the manners of what a person is not but would like to be, in forming our first impression of that person. To the outward appearance affectation, imitation, the longing to be admired, whether by the good or by the wicked, add misleading similarities of speech and gesture. These are cynicisms and cruelties which, when put to the test, prove no more genuine than certain apparent virtues and generosities. Just as we often discover a vain miser beneath the cloak of a man famed for his bountiful charity, so her flaunting of vice leads us to suppose a Messalina a respectable girl with middle-class prejudices. I had thought to find in Andrée a healthy, primitive creature, whereas she was merely a person in search of health, as were doubtless many of those in whom she herself had thought to find it, and who were in reality no more healthy than a burly arthritic with a red face and in white flannels is necessarily a Hercules. Now there are circumstances in which it is not immaterial to our happiness that the person whom we have loved because of what appeared to be so healthy about her is in reality only one of those invalids who receive such health as they possess from others, as the planets borrow their light, as certain bodies are only conductors of electricity<br>
<br>
    No matter, Andrée, like Rosemonde and Gisèle, indeed more than they, was, when all was said, a friend of Albertine, sharing her life, imitating her conduct, so closely that, the first day, I had not at once distinguished them one from another. Over these girls, flowering sprays of roses whose principal charm was that they outlined themselves against the sea, the same undivided partnership prevailed as at the time when I did not know them, when the appearance of no matter which of them had caused me such violent emotion by its announcement that the little band was not far off. And even now the sight of one of them filled me with a pleasure into which there entered, to an extent which I should not have found it easy to define, the thought of seeing the others follow her in due course, and even if they did not come that day, speaking about them, and knowing that they would be told that I had been on the beach<br>
<br>
    It was no longer simply the attraction of those first days, it was a regular love-longing which hesitated among them all, so far was each the natural substitute for the others. My bitterest grief would not have been to be thrown over by whichever of the girls I liked best, but I should at once have liked best, because I should have fastened on to her the whole of the melancholy dream which had been floating vaguely among them all, her who had thrown me over. It would, moreover, in that event, be the loss of all her friends, in whose eyes I should speedily have forfeited whatever advantage I might possess, that I should, in losing her, have unconsciously regretted, having vowed to them that sort of collective love which the politician and the actor feel for the public for whose desertion of them after they have enjoyed all its favours they can never be consoled. Even those favours which I had failed to win from Albertine I would hope suddenly to receive from one or other who had parted from me in the evening with a word or glance of ambiguous meaning, thanks to which it was to her that, for the next day or so, my desire would turn. It strayed among them all the more voluptuously in that upon those volatile faces a comparative fixation of features had now begun, and had been carried far enough for the eye to distinguish — even if it were to change yet further — each malleable and floating effigy. To the differences that existed among them there was doubtless very little that corresponded in the no less marked differences in the length and breadth of those features, any of which might, perhaps, dissimilar as the girls appeared, almost have been lifted bodily from one face and imposed at random upon any other. But our knowledge of faces is not mathematical. In the first place, it does not begin with the measurement of the parts, it takes as its starting point an expression, a combination of the whole. In Andrée, for instance, the fineness of her gentle eyes seemed to go with the thinness of her nose, as slender as a mere curve which one could imagine as having been traced in order to produce along a single line the idea of delicacy divided higher up between the dual smile of her twin gaze. A line equally fine was engraved in her hair, pliant and deep as the line with which the wind furrows the sand. And in her it must have been hereditary; for the snow-white hair of Andrée’s mother was driven in the same way, forming here a swelling, there a depression, like a snowdrift that rises or sinks according to the irregularities of the soil. Certainly, when compared with the fine delineation of Andrée’s, Rosemonde’s nose seemed to present broad surfaces, like a high tower raised upon massive foundations. Albeit expression suffices to make us believe in enormous differences between things that are separated by infinitely little — albeit that infinitely little may by itself create an expression that is absolutely unique, an individuality — it was not only the infinitely little of its lines and the originality of its expression that made each of these faces appear irreducible to terms of any other. Between my friends’ faces their colouring established a separation wider still, not so much by the varied beauty of the tones with which it provided them, so contrasted that I felt when I looked at Rosemonde — flooded with a sulphurous rose colour, with the further contrast of the greenish light in her eyes — and then at Andrée — whose white cheeks received such an austere distinction from her black hair — the same kind of pleasure as if I had been looking alternately at a geranium growing by a sunlit sea and a camellia in the night; but principally because the infinitely little differences of their lines were enlarged out of all proportion, the relations between one and another surface entirely changed by this new element of colour which, in addition to being a dispenser of tints, is great at restoring, or rather at altering, dimensions. So that faces which were perhaps constructed on not dissimilar lines, according as they were lighted by the flaming torch of an auburn poll or high complexion, or by the white glimmer of a dull pallor, grew sharper or broader, became something else, like those properties used in the Russian ballet, consisting sometimes, when they are seen in the light of day, of a mere disc of paper, out of which the genius of a Bakst, according to the blood-red or moonlit effect in which he plunges his stage, makes a hard incrustation, like a turquoise on a palace well, or a swooning softness, as of a Bengal rose in an eastern garden. And so when acquiring a knowledge of faces we take careful measurements, but as painters, not as surveyors<br>
<br>
    So it was with Albertine as with her friends. On certain days, slim, with grey cheeks, a sullen air, a violet transparency falling obliquely from her such as we notice sometimes on the sea, she seemed to be feeling the sorrows of exile. On other days her face, more sleek, caught and glued my desires to its varnished surface and prevented them from going any farther; unless I caught a sudden glimpse of her from the side, for her dull cheeks, like white wax on the surface, were visibly pink beneath, which made me anxious to kiss them, to reach that different tint which thus avoided my touch. At other times happiness bathed her cheeks with a clarity so mobile that the skin, grown fluid and vague, gave passage to a sort of stealthy and subcutaneous gaze, which made it appear to be of another colour but not of another substance than her eyes; sometimes, instinctively, when one looked at her face punctuated with tiny brown marks among which floated what were simply two larger, bluer stains, it was like looking at the egg of a goldfinch — or often like an opalescent agate cut and polished in two places only, where, from the heart of the brown stone, shone like the transparent wings of a sky-blue butterfly her eyes, those features in which the flesh becomes a mirror and gives us the illusion that it allows us, more than through the other parts of the body, to approach the soul. But most often of all she shewed more colour, and was then more animated; sometimes the only pink thing in her white face was the tip of her nose, as finely pointed as that of a mischievous kitten with which one would have liked to stop and play; sometimes her cheeks were so glossy that one’s glance slipped, as over the surface of a miniature, over their pink enamel, which was made to appear still more delicate, more private, by the enclosing though half-opened case of her black hair; or it might happen that the tint of her cheeks had deepened to the violet shade of the red cyclamen, and, at times, even, when she was flushed or feverish, with a suggestion of un-healthiness which lowered my desire to something more sensual and made her glance expressive of something more perverse and unwholesome, to the deep purple of certain roses, a red that was almost black; and each of these Albertines was different, as in every fresh appearance of the dancer whose colours, form, character, are transmuted according to the innumerably varied play of a projected limelight. It was perhaps because they were so different, the persons whom I used to contemplate in her at this period, that later on I became myself a different person, corresponding to the particular Albertine to whom my thoughts had turned; a jealous, an indifferent, a voluptuous, a melancholy, a frenzied person, created anew not merely by the accident of what memory had risen to the surface, but in proportion also to the strength of the belief that was lent to the support of one and the same memory by the varying manner in which I appreciated it. For this is the point to which we must always return, to these beliefs with which most of the time we are quite unconsciously filled, but which for all that are of more importance to our happiness than is the average person whom we see, for it is through them that we see him, it is they that impart his momentary greatness to the person seen. To be quite accurate I ought to give a different name to each of the ‘me’s’ who were to think about Albertine in time to come; I ought still more to give a different name to each of the Albertines who appeared before me, never the same, like — called by me simply and for the sake of convenience ‘the sea’— those seas that succeeded one another on the beach, in front of which, a nymph likewise, she stood apart. But above all, in the same way as, in telling a story (though to far greater purpose here), one mentions what the weather was like on such and such a day, I ought always to give its name to the belief that, on any given day on which I saw Albertine, was reigning in my soul, creating its atmosphere, the appearance of people like that of seas being dependent on those clouds, themselves barely visible, which change the colour of everything by their concentration, their mobility, their dissemination, their flight — like that cloud which Elstir had rent one evening by not introducing me to these girls, with whom he had stopped to talk, whereupon their forms, as they moved away, had suddenly increased in beauty — a cloud that had formed again a few days later when I did get to know the girls, veiling their brightness, interposing itself frequently between my eyes and them, opaque and soft, like Virgil’s Leucothea<br>
<br>
    No doubt, all their faces had assumed quite new meanings for me since the manner in which they were to be read had been to some extent indicated to me by their talk, talk to which I could ascribe a value all the greater in that, by questioning them, I could prompt it whenever I chose, could vary it like an experimenter who seeks by corroborative proofs to establish the truth of his theory. And it is, after all, as good a way as any of solving the problem of existence to approach near enough to the things that have appeared to us from a distance to be beautiful and mysterious, to be able to satisfy ourselves that they have neither mystery nor beauty. It is one of the systems of hygiene among which we are at liberty to choose our own, a system which is perhaps not to be recommended too strongly, but it gives us a certain tranquillity with which to spend what remains of life, and also — since it enables us to regref nothing, by assuring us that we have attained to the best, and that the best was nothing out of the common — with which to resign ourselves to death<br>
<br>
    I had now substituted, in the brains of these girls, for their supposed contempt for chastity, their memories of daily ‘incidents,’ honest principles, liable, it might be, to relaxation, but principles which had hitherto kept unscathed the children who had acquired them in their own respectable homes. And yet, when one has been mistaken from the start, even in trifling details, when an error of assumption or recollection makes one seek for the author of a malicious slander, or for the place where one has lost something, in the wrong direction, it frequently happens that one discovers one’s error only to substitute for it not the truth but a fresh error. I drew, so far as their manner of life and the proper way to behave with them went, all the possible conclusions from the word ‘Innocence’ which I had read, in talking familiarly with them, upon their faces. But perhaps I had been reading carelessly, with the inaccuracy born of a too rapid deciphering, and it was no more written there than was the name of Jules Ferry on the programme of the performance at which I had heard Berma for the first time, an omission which had not prevented me from maintaining to M. de Norpois that Jules Ferry, beyond any possibility of doubt, was a person who wrote curtain-raisers<br>
<br>
    No matter which it might be of my friends of the little band, was not inevitably the face that I had last seen the only face that I could recall, since, of our memories with respect to a person, the mind eliminates everything that does not agree with our immediate purpose of our daily relations (especially if those relations are quickened with an element of love which, ever unsatisfied, lives always in the moment that is about to come)? That purpose allows the chain of spent days to slip away, holding on only to the very end of it, often of a quite different metal from the links that have vanished in the night, and in the journey which we make through life, counts as real only in the place in which we at any given moment are. But all those earliest impressions, already so remote, could not find, against the blunting process that assailed them day after day, any remedy in my memory; during the long hours which I spent in talking, eating, playing with these girls, I did not remember even that they were the same ruthless, sensual virgins whom I had seen, as in a fresco, file past between me and the sea<br>
<br>
    Geographers, archaeologists may conduct us over Calypso’s island, may excavate the Palace of Minos. Only Calypso becomes then nothing more than a woman, Minos than a king with no semblance of divinity. Even the good and bad qualities which history teaches us to have been the attributes of those quite real personages, often differ widely from those which we had ascribed to the fabulous beings who bore the same names as they. Thus had there faded and vanished all the lovely mythology of Ocean which I had composed in those first days. But it is not altogether immaterial that we do succeed, at any rate now and then, in spending our time in familiar intercourse with what we have thought to be unattainable and have longed to possess. In our later dealings with people whom at first we found disagreeable there persists always, even among the artificial pleasure which we have come at length to enjoy in their society, the lingering taint of the defects which they have succeeded in hiding. But, in relations such as I was now having with Albertine and her friends, the genuine pleasure which was there at the start leaves that fragrance which no amount of skill can impart to hot-house fruits, to grapes that have not ripened in the sun. The supernatural creatures which for a little time they had been to me still introduced, even without any intention on my part, a miraculous element into the most commonplace dealings that I might have with them, or rather prevented such dealings from ever becoming commonplace at all. My desire had sought so ardently to learn the significance of the eyes which now knew and smiled to see me, but whose glances on the first day had crossed mine like rays from another universe; it had distributed so generously, so carefully, so minutely, colour and fragrance over the carnation surfaces of these girls who now, outstretched on the cliff-top, were simply offering me sandwiches or guessing riddles, that often, in the afternoon, while I lay there among them, like those painters who seek to match the grandeurs of antiquity in modern life, give to a woman cutting her toe-nail the nobility of the Spinario, or, like Rubens, make goddesses out of women whom they know, to people some mythological scene; at those lovely forms, dark and fair, so dissimilar in type, scattered around me in the grass, I would gaze without emptying them, perhaps, of all the mediocre contents with which my everyday experience had filled them, and at the same time without expressly recalling their heavenly origin, as if, like young Hercules or young Telemachus, I had been set to play amid a band of nymphs<br>
<br>
    Then the concerts ended, the bad weather began, my friends left Balbec; not all at once, like the swallows, but all in the same week. Albertine was the first to go, abruptly, without any of her friends understanding, then or afterwards, why she had returned suddenly to Paris whither neither her work nor any amusement summoned her. “She said neither why nor wherefore, and with that she left!” muttered Françoise, who, for that matter, would have liked us to leave as well. We were, she thought, inconsiderate towards the staff, now greatly reduced in number, but retained on account of the few visitors who were still staying on, and towards the manager who was ‘just eating up money.’ It was true that the hotel, which would very soon be closed for the winter, had long since seen most of its patrons depart, but never had it been so attractive. This view was not shared by the manager; from end to end of the rooms in which we sat shivering, and and at the doors of which no page now stood on guard, he paced the corridors, wearing a new frock coat, so well tended by the hairdresser that his insipid face appeared to be made of some composition in which, for one part of flesh, there were three of cosmetics, incessantly changing his neckties. (These refinements cost less than having the place heated and keeping on the staff, just as a man who is no longer able to subscribe ten thousand francs to a charity can still parade his generosity without inconvenience to himself by tipping the boy who brings him a telegram with five.) He appeared to be inspecting the empty air, to be seeking to give, by the smartness of his personal appearance, a provisional splendour to the desolation that could now be felt in this hotel where the season had not been good, and walked like the ghost of a monarch who returns to haunt the ruins of what was once his palace. He was particularly annoyed when the little local railway company, finding the supply of passengers inadequate, discontinued its trains until the following spring. “What is lacking here,” said the manager, “is the means of commotion.” In spite of the deficit which his books shewed, he was making plans for the future on a lavish scale. And as he was, after all, capable of retaining an exact memory of fine language when it was directly applicable to the hotel-keeping industry and had the effect of enhancing its importance: “I was not adequately supported, although in the dining room I had an efficient squad,” he explained; “but the pages left something to be desired. You will see, next year, what a phalanx I shall collect.” In the meantime the suspension of the services of the B. C. B. obliged him to send for letters and occasionally to dispatch visitors in a light cart. I would often ask leave to sit by the driver, and in this way I managed to be out in all weathers, as in the winter that I had spent at Combray<br>
<br>
    Sometimes, however, the driving rain kept my grandmother and me, the Casino being closed, in rooms almost completely deserted, as in the lowest hold of a ship when a storm is raging; and there, day by day, as in the course of a sea-voyage, a new person from among those in whose company we had spent three months without getting to know them, the chief magistrate from Caen, the leader of the Cherbourg bar, an American lady and her daughters, came up to us, started conversation, discovered some way of making the time pass less slowly, revealed some social accomplishment, taught us a new game, invited us to drink tea or to listen to music, to meet them at a certain hour, to plan together some of those diversions which contain the true secret of pleasure-giving, which is to aim not at giving pleasure but simply at helping us to pass the time of our boredom, in a word, formed with us, at the end of our stay at Balbec, ties of friendship which, in a day or two, their successive departures from the place would sever. I even made the acquaintance of the rich young man, of one of his pair of aristocratic friends and of the actress, who had reappeared for a few days; but their little society was composed now of three persons only, the other friend having returned to Paris. They asked me to come out to dinner with them at their restaurant. I think, they were just as well pleased that I did not accept. But they had given the invitation in the most friendly way imaginable, and albeit it came actually from the rich young man, since the others were only his guests, as the friend who was staying with him, the Marquis Maurice de Vaudémont, came of a very good family indeed, instinctively the actress, in asking me whether I would not come, said, to flatter my vanity: “Maurice will be so pleased.”<br>
<br>
    And when in the hall of the hotel I met them all three together, it was M. de Vaudémont (the rich young man effacing himself) who said to me: “Won’t you give us the pleasure of dining with us?”<br>
<br>
    On the whole I had derived very little benefit from Balbec, but this only strengthened my desire to return there. It seemed to me that I had not stayed there long enough. This was not what my friends at home were thinking, who wrote to ask whether I meant to stay there for the rest of my life. And when I saw that it was the name ‘Balbec’ which they were obliged to put on the envelope — just as my window looked out not over a landscape or a street but on to the plains of the sea, as I heard through the night its murmur to which I had before going to sleep entrusted my ship of dreams, I had the illusion that this life of promiscuity with the waves must effectively, without my knowledge, pervade me with the notion of their charm, like those lessons which one leams by heart while one is asleep<br>
<br>
    The manager offered to reserve better rooms for me next year, but I had now become attached to mine, into which I went without ever noticing the scent of flowering grasses, while my mind, which had once found such difficulty in rising to fill its space had come now to take its measurements so exactly that I was obliged to submit it to a reverse process when I had to sleep in Paris, in my own room, the ceiling of which was low<br>
<br>
    It was high time, indeed, to leave Balbec, for the cold and damp had become too penetrating for us to stay any longer in a hotel which had neither fireplaces in the rooms nor a central furnace. Moreover, I forgot almost immediately these last weeks of our stay. What my mind’s eye did almost invariably see when I thought of Balbec were the hours which, every morning during the fine weather, as I was going out in the afternoon with Albertine and her friends, my grandmother, following the doctor’s orders, insisted on my spending lying down, with the room darkened. The manager gave instructions that no noise was to be made on my landing, and came up himself to see that they were obeyed. Because the light outside was so strong, I kept drawn for as long as possible the big violet curtains which had adopted so hostile an attitude towards me the first evening. But as, in spite of the pins with which, so that the light should not enter, Françoise fastened them every night, pins which she alone knew how to unfasten; as in spite of the rugs, the red cretonne table-cover, the various fabrics collected here and there which she fitted in to her defensive scheme, she never succeeded in making them meet exactly, the darkness was not complete, and they allowed to spill over the carpet as it were a scarlet shower of anemone-petals, among which I could not resist the temptation to plunge my bare feet for a moment. And on the wall which faced the window and so was partially lighted, a cylinder of gold with no visible support was placed vertically and moved slowly along like the pillar of fire which went before the Hebrews in the desert. I went back to bed; obliged to taste without moving, in imagination only, and all at once, the pleasures of games, bathing, walks which the morning prompted, joy made my heart beat thunderingly like a machine set going at full speed but fixed to the ground, which can spend its energy only by turning upon its own axis<br>
<br>
    I knew that my friends were on the ‘front,’ but I did not see them as they passed before the links of the sea’s uneven chain, far at the back of which, and nestling amid its bluish peaks like an Italian citadel, one could occasionally, in a clear moment, make out the little town of Rivebelle, drawn in minutest detail by the sun. I did not see my friends, but (while there mounted to my belvedere the shout of the newsboy, the ‘journalists’ as Françoise used to call them, the shouts of the bathers and of children at play, punctuating like the cries of sea-birds the sound of the gently breaking waves) I guessed their presence, I heard their laughter enveloped like the laughter of the Nereids in the smooth tide of sound that rose to my ears. “We looked up,” said Albertine in the evening, “to see if you were coming down. But your shutters were still closed when the concert began.” At ten o’clock, sure enough, it broke out beneath my windows. In the intervals in the blare of the instruments, if the tide were high, would begin again, slurred and continuous, the gliding surge of a wave which seemed to enfold the notes of the violin in its crystal spirals and to be spraying its foam over echoes of a submarine music. I grew impatient because no one had yet come with my things, so that I might rise and dress. Twelve o’clock struck, Françoise arrived at last. And for months on end, in this Balbec to which I had so looked forward because I imagined it only as battered by the storm and buried in fogs, the weather had been so dazzling and so unchanging that when she came to open the window I could always, without once being wrong, expect to see the same patch of sunlight folded in the corner of the outer wall, of an unalterable colour which was less moving as a sign of summer than depressing as the colour of a lifeless and composed enamel. And after Françoise had removed her pins from the mouldings of the window-frame, taken down her various cloths, and drawn back the curtains, the summer day which she disclosed seemed as dead, as immemorially ancient as would have been a sumptuously attired dynastic mummy from which our old servant had done no more than pre-cautionally unwind the linen wrappings before displaying it to my gaze, embalmed in its vesture of gold</p>

I hear the drums echoing tonight<br>
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation<br>
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight<br>
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation<br>
I stopped an old man along the way<br>
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies<br>
He turned to me as if to say<br>
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""<br>

"<p>[Verse 1]<br>
5:34 AM, I was about to start my day<br>
But she lay in there across me, so I stayed anyway<br>
Arms tied, legs numb, her wrapped around my knee<br>
Sweetest of the sunflowers, how you're the sun to me<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I don’t recall what you were wearing on the first night we met<br>
Besides the subtle cloud around you from my last cigarette<br>
And you come from a good place with a happy family<br>

That the good Lord willin', sends you out my way<br>
I'vе seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between<br>
Sweetest of thе sunflowers, how you're the sun to me<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
And I remember being younger and my mother told me true<br>

[Verse 4]<br>
And you walked me home that evening when I could barely walk<br>
And you spoke to me so sweetly on the days I couldn’t talk<br>
And now I'm seeing clearly and I’m growing up so free<br>

They brought back memories<br>
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted<br>
But it ain't with me<br>

Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours<br>

"<p>[Letra de ""Poco A Poco""]<br>
<br>
[Verso: Xavi &amp; <i>Darey Castro</i>]<br>
Y poco a poco fui creciendo y la vida me enseñó<br>
Que tienes que ser decente con el que un día te humilló<br>
<i>Bien recuerdo aquellos tiempos que salimos del lodo<br>
Cuando andábamos a pata y nadie nunca nos peló</i><br>
<br>
[Coro: Xavi &amp; <i>Darey Castro</i>]<br>
En la esquina me vieron con los plebes<br>
Me miraban entre los enredes<br>
Chingándole para hacer billete<br>
<i>Soy el único de la familia quе se atrevió andar en la movida<br>
Chingándolе pa' una mejor vida<br>
Brinqué pa'l otro lado</i><br>
Y empezamos desde cero y lentamente formé un imperio<br>
Comenzamos con los veinte, después kilos, hoy me estoy riendo<br>
<i>Y a los que no me creían que no podía pensar en grande<br>
Yo ando fuerte todavía</i><br>
Con la bendición de mi madre<br>
<br>

Aquí no andamos haciendo bulto<br>
Al chingazo yo resulto<br>
Y una glockzona que va conmigo<br>
Siempre lista para un susto<br>

Unas banquetearas a veces tomando<br>

Y mi compa Sapo, si hay pedo, él brinca<br>
A la orden en una a tirar vergazos<br>

Down the stairs to have a peep<br>

In my bedroom, fast asleep<br>

Then I saw mommy tickle, tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)<br>
Underneath his beard so snowy white<br>
Oh, what a laugh it would have been<br>

Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night<br>
